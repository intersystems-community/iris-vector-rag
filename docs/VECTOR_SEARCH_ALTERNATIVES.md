# Alternative Vector Search Approaches Investigation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines an investigation into alternative approaches to vector search in InterSystems IRIS that may overcome the current TO_VECTOR function limitations. By examining successful implementations in external repositories (llama-iris and langchain-iris), we aim to identify techniques that could resolve our critical blocker: the inability to load documents with embeddings due to ODBC driver limitations with the TO_VECTOR function.

## Problem Statement

Our current RAG templates project is blocked by limitations in the InterSystems IRIS SQL vector operations, specifically:

1. **TO_VECTOR() Function Rejects Parameter Markers**: The TO_VECTOR() function does not accept parameter markers (?, :param, or :%qpar), which are standard in SQL for safe query parameterization.

2. **Client Drivers Rewrite Literals**: Python, JDBC, and other client drivers replace embedded literals with :%qpar(n) even when no parameter list is supplied, creating misleading parse errors.

3. **ODBC Driver Limitations**: When attempting to load documents with embeddings, the ODBC driver encounters limitations with the TO_VECTOR function, preventing the loading of vector embeddings.

While we have implemented workarounds for *querying* vector data using string interpolation with validation, the *loading* of embeddings remains a critical blocker that prevents testing with real PMC data.

## External Repositories Analysis

We have identified two external repositories that successfully implement vector search with InterSystems IRIS:

1. **llama-iris**: LlamaIndex integration with IRIS
   - Repository: https://github.com/caretdev/llama-iris
   - Provides IRISVectorStore for LlamaIndex

2. **langchain-iris**: LangChain integration with IRIS
   - Repository: https://github.com/caretdev/langchain-iris
   - Provides IRISVector for LangChain

Initial code review reveals several key differences in their approach compared to our current implementation:

### Key Architectural Differences

| Feature | External Repositories | Current RAG Templates |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Database Access** | SQLAlchemy with custom dialect | Direct DBAPI connection |
| **Vector Type** | `IRISVectorType` or `IRISListBuild` | Direct SQL with `TO_VECTOR()` |
| **Query Construction** | SQLAlchemy query building | String interpolation with validation |
| **Fallback Mechanism** | Custom ObjectScript functions | Limited workarounds |
| **Container Approach** | Testcontainers | Dedicated Docker container |
| **IRIS Version** | 2024.1-preview or latest-cd | Not explicitly specified |

### Critical Differences in Vector Handling

1. **Vector Type Detection**:
   ```python
   # langchain-iris approach
   if conn.dialect.supports_vectors:
       self.native_vector = True
   ```

2. **Dynamic Vector Type Selection**:
   ```python
   # langchain-iris approach
   Column(
       "embedding",
       (
           IRISVectorType(self.dimension)
           if self.native_vector
           else IRISListBuild(self.dimension, float)
       ),
   )
   ```

3. **Custom ObjectScript Functions**:
   Both external repositories create custom ObjectScript functions for vector operations when native vector support isn't available:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION langchain_cosine_distance(v1 VARBINARY, v2 VARBINARY)
   RETURNS NUMERIC(0,16)
   LANGUAGE OBJECTSCRIPT
   {
       set dims = $listlength(v1)
       set (distance, norm1, norm2, similarity) = 0
       
       for i=1:1:dims {
           set val1 = $list(v1, i)
           set val2 = $list(v2, i)
           
           set distance = distance + (val1 * val2)
           set norm1 = norm1 + (val1 * val1)
           set norm2 = norm2 + (val2 * val2)
       }
       
       set similarity = distance / $zsqr(norm1 * norm2)
       set similarity = $select(similarity > 1: 1, similarity < -1: -1, 1: similarity)
       quit 1 - similarity
   }
   ```

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Verification

1. **Set up test environments with both approaches**:
   - Create a simple test script using the `llama-iris` approach
   - Create a simple test script using our current approach
   - Use the same IRIS version (2024.1-preview) for both tests

2. **Verify vector operations in both environments**:
   - Test vector loading (embedding storage)
   - Test vector querying (similarity search)
   - Document any differences in behavior

### Phase 2: Detailed Analysis of Vector Operations

1. **Analyze vector loading mechanisms**:
   - Trace SQL queries generated by both approaches
   - Identify how `llama-iris` and `langchain-iris` handle embedding insertion
   - Compare with our current approach

2. **Analyze vector querying mechanisms**:
   - Trace SQL queries for similarity search
   - Identify how parameter binding is handled
   - Compare performance and reliability

3. **Examine SQLAlchemy dialect implementation**:
   - Review `sqlalchemy_iris` code to understand vector support detection
   - Identify how it handles vector types and operations
   - Determine if it's using a different approach for `TO_VECTOR()`

### Phase 3: Adaptation Strategy

1. **Develop proof-of-concept adaptations**:
   - Implement SQLAlchemy approach in a test branch
   - Test custom ObjectScript functions approach
   - Evaluate hybrid approach using our existing code with targeted improvements

2. **Benchmark and compare approaches**:
   - Measure performance of each approach
   - Evaluate reliability and compatibility
   - Document trade-offs

3. **Create migration plan**:
   - Outline steps to adapt successful approaches to our project
   - Identify required changes to existing code
   - Estimate effort and impact

## Test Script Design

We have designed a test script (`investigation/test_vector_approaches.py`) that will:

1. Set up an IRIS container using testcontainers
2. Test vector operations using the langchain-iris approach
3. Test vector operations using the llama-iris approach
4. Test vector operations using the current project's approach
5. Compare the results and behavior

The script focuses specifically on the vector loading issue, which is our critical blocker. It attempts to insert documents with embeddings using different approaches and reports on the success or failure of each method.

```python
# Key components of the test script
class VectorSearchInvestigation:
    def __init__(self, iris_image: str = "intersystemsdc/iris-community:2024.1-preview"):
        """Initialize the investigation with the specified IRIS image."""
        self.iris_image = iris_image
        self.container = None
        self.connection_string = None
        self.embedding_model = TextEmbedding("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
        
    # Methods for testing different approaches
    def test_langchain_iris_approach(self):
        """Test vector search using the langchain-iris approach."""
        # Implementation details...
    
    def test_llama_iris_approach(self):
        """Test vector search using the llama-iris approach."""
        # Implementation details...
    
    def test_current_project_approach(self):
        """Test vector search using the current project's approach."""
        # Implementation details...
    
    def run_investigation(self):
        """Run the full investigation."""
        # Implementation details...
```

## Expected Outcomes

This investigation is expected to yield:

1. **Clear understanding** of how external repositories successfully implement vector search with IRIS
2. **Identification of specific techniques** that overcome the TO_VECTOR function limitations
3. **Proof-of-concept implementation** of a working approach for loading embeddings
4. **Migration plan** for adapting our codebase to use the successful approach
5. **Documentation** of findings and recommendations

## Next Steps

1. **Execute the investigation plan**:
   - Run the test script to compare approaches
   - Document findings and insights
   - Identify the most promising approach

2. **Implement the solution**:
   - Adapt our codebase to use the successful approach
   - Test with real PMC data
   - Verify that the critical blocker is resolved

3. **Update documentation**:
   - Document the new approach in IRIS_SQL_VECTOR_OPERATIONS.md
   - Update IRIS_SQL_VECTOR_LIMITATIONS.md with new insights
   - Create migration guide for future reference

## Conclusion

By investigating alternative approaches to vector search in IRIS, we aim to overcome the critical blocker that is preventing us from testing with real PMC data. This investigation is a crucial step toward completing the project and delivering a fully functional set of RAG templates for InterSystems IRIS.
