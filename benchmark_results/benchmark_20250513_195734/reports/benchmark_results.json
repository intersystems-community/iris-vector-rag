Oleocanthal (OO), one of the most potent bioactive phenols of extra virgin olive oil, has shown redox modulating properties in vitro. However, its acute, in vivo antioxidant properties have never been studied before. The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of five redox markers (Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances [TBARS] and glutathione peroxidase activity in serum-GPx3 and erythrocytes (GPx1), protein carbonyls in serum) after the consumption different meals. Five different isocaloric meals comprised of white bread and butter (BU) or butter plus ibuprofen (BU-IBU) or olive oil poor in OO or olive oils containing 250 and 500 mg/Kg of oleocanthal (OO250 and OO500, respectively). We hypothesized that OO-rich olive oil will reduce postprandial oxidative stress in T2DM patients compared to other lipid sources. This study involved 10 patients with T2DM and had a cross-over design. The comparison of incremental Area Under Curves (iAUCs) has shown that OO-rich olive oils were able to alleviate the increments of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and GPx3 and induce a higher red blood cells (RBCs) GPx1 activity compared to OO ( P This study demonstrates for the first time that, apart from its anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet properties, OO can also exert acute antioxidant effects.

Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy.

Currently, the description of the immune system in human CKD is not comprehensive enough. Constructing a CKD kidney atlas using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can provide deeper insights into the composition and functional changes of immune cells in CKD, facilitating the discovery of new therapeutic targets. We processed and integrated scRNA-seq datasets from healthy and CKD kidneys from three independent cohorts using the same approach (including 42 normal samples and 23 chronic kidney disease samples). Subsequently, we conducted gene enrichment and intercellular communication analysis to construct an immune cell atlas of the kidneys in CKD patients. We identified nine major kidney cell clusters. Further clustering analysis of different immune cell clusters revealed that, compared to normal kidneys, CKD patients\u2019 kidneys had decreased CD16+ NK cells while CD4+ naive helper T cells and CCR7+ DC increased. Partial activation of the WNT signaling pathway was observed in T cells and NK cells of CKD patients, while some metabolism-related genes were inhibited. Myeloid cell subgroups also exhibited abnormal signaling pathway alterations. Additionally, we discovered a unique population of SPP1 macrophages in CKD, which are recruited by chemokines released from aPT and aTAL cell subpopulations. These SPP1 macrophages may promote cellular fibrosis through the signaling of SPP1, FN1, and various receptors. We established a human CKD kidney immune cell atlas and identified SPP1 macrophages as a unique cell type in CKD. The interaction between SPP1 macrophages and damaged cells may serve as a potential therapeutic target for treating CKD in the future.",

Odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of DR associated with each SL stage were calculated using logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, HbA1c, C-reactive protein level, and alcohol consumption.

The FINE-REAL study (NCT05348733) aims to evaluate the characteristics and treatment patterns of participants treated with finerenone in clinical practice. FINE-REAL is a prospective, single-arm, non-interventional study of patients initiated on finerenone as part of their routine care in accordance with country-approved labels. The study, initiated in June 2022, is expected to be completed by January 2028. The cutoff for this pre-specified interim analysis was June 13, 2023. Participants were recruited across nephrology, endocrinology, cardiology, and primary care settings. Of 556 participants enrolled in the study by the cut-off date, 504 were included in this analysis (median follow-up duration of 7\u00a0months [finerenone treatment initiation to last recorded observation]). At baseline, 76.1% of participants were in the high or very high (KDIGO) CKD risk categories. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were prescribed to 71.8% and 46.6% of participants, respectively. Based on prescribing information, 87.9% and 12.1% of participants initiated finerenone at doses of 10 and 20\u00a0mg, respectively. Finerenone treatment was uninterrupted in 92.3% of participants after 7\u00a0months\u2019 median follow-up. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 110 (21.8%) participants. Hyperkalemia occurred in 25 (5.0%) participants, with no cases leading to death, dialysis, or hospitalization. At this interim analysis, finerenone was initiated in patients with CKD and T2D across various clinical practices participating in the study. Treatment discontinuation and hyperkalemia occurred infrequently. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40620-024-02070-y.",
