Here we show that the depletion of tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), causes synthetic dosage lethality (SDL) in MAD2-overexpressing cells, and we term this cell death MAD2-overexpressing interphase cell death (MOID). The induction of MOID depends on PML and DAXX mediating mitochondrial AIFM1-release. MAD2, TSG101, and AIF-PML-DAXX axis regulate mitochondria, PML nuclear bodies (NBs), and autophagy with close inter-dependent protein stability in survival cells. Loss of C-terminal phosphorylation(s) of TSG101 and closed (C-)MAD2-overexpression contribute to induce MOID. In survival cells, both MAD2 and TSG101 localize at PML NBs in interphase, and TSG101 Y390 phosphorylation is required for localization of TSG101 to PML NBs. PML release from PML NBs through PML deSUMOylation contributes to induce MOID. The post-transcriptional/translational cell death machinery and the non-canonical transcriptional regulation are intricately linked to MOID, and ER-MAM, may serve as a crucial intersection for MOID signaling.",

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity\u2013response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.",

Fifteen patients diagnosed with stage III/grade C periodontitis were included in the cohort. The right and left sides of the mouth were randomly assigned either the conventional SRP (control) group or the SRP supplemented with Nd:YAG laser group (experimental group, 160 mJ, 4 W) in a split-mouth design. Clinical periodontal indices were recorded at baseline and at the 6-week follow-up post-treatment. ELISA was utilised to measure IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in gingival crevicular fluid. The subgingival microbiota\u2019s composition and variations were characterised using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, while quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to analyse the changes in the red-complex bacteria in subgingival plaque. The SRP+Nd group exhibited a statistically significant reduction in record probing depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP) compared to the SRP group after treatment (p<0.05). The SRP+Nd group showed a markedly lower IL-1\u03b2 level than the SRP group (p<0.05). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in the dominant subgingival microbiota composition and level of the red-complex bacteria between the two groups (p>0.05). The adjunctive use of Nd:YAG laser with SRP demonstrates promising short-term therapeutic benefits for patients with extensive stage III/grade C periodontitis. Both SRP as a standalone treatment and its combination with Nd:YAG laser effectively facilitate a transition in the dominant bacterial community from periodontitis-associated to periodontal health-associated microbiota.",

Immunotherapy, as a novel therapeutic methodology, has opened up new possibilities for colorectal cancer patients. However, its actual clinical efficacy requires further enhancement. Copper, as an exceptionally crucial trace element, can influence various signaling pathways, gene expression, and biological metabolic processes in cells, thus playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Recent studies have revealed that cuproptosis, a novel mode of cell death, holds promise to become a potential target to overcome resistance to colorectal cancer immunotherapy. This shows substantial potential in the combination treatment of colorectal cancer. Conveying copper into tumor cells via a nano-drug delivery system to induce cuproptosis of colorectal cancer cells could offer a potential strategy for eliminating drug-resistant colorectal cancer cells and vastly improving the efficacy of immunotherapy while ultimately destroy colorectal tumors. Moreover, combining the cuproptosis induction strategy with other anti-tumor approaches such as photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and chemodynamic therapy could further enhance its therapeutic effect.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity\u2013response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.",

We present a case of mercury vapor poisoning resulting from the heating of cinnabar, successfully treated with high-dose corticosteroids and chelation therapy, and follow-up over 6 months. A 47-year-old female patient was admitted to the Emergency Department due to dyspnea, chest tightness, and weakness following cinnabar heating. Upon admission, she presented with tachypnea and respiratory failure. During the first 5 days, the respiratory failure rapidly progressed, requiring high-flow nasal cannula support, and showed no improvement with broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics and 80\u2005mg daily IV methylprednisolone. Total blood and urinary mercury levels were measured to confirm the diagnosis. Upon confirmation of acute pneumonitis due to mercury vapor poisoning, the patient was administered high-dose methylprednisolone (500\u2005mg IV per day) and chelation therapy, which led to subsequent improvement. Six months after discharge, the patient completely recovered, as evidenced by chest imaging and pulmonary function tests. Heating elemental mercury can cause pneumonitis, leading to acute respiratory failure. A detailed history is crucial for diagnosis.

In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy.

            "Overexpression of mitotic arrest deficiency 2 (MAD2/MAD2L1), a pivotal component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), resulted in many types of cancer. Here we show that the depletion of tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), causes synthetic dosage lethality (SDL) in MAD2-overexpressing cells, and we term this cell death MAD2-overexpressing interphase cell death (MOID). The induction of MOID depends on PML and DAXX mediating mitochondrial AIFM1-release. MAD2, TSG101, and AIF-PML-DAXX axis regulate mitochondria, PML nuclear bodies (NBs), and autophagy with close inter-dependent protein stability in survival cells. Loss of C-terminal phosphorylation(s) of TSG101 and closed (C-)MAD2-overexpression contribute to induce MOID. In survival cells, both MAD2 and TSG101 localize at PML NBs in interphase, and TSG101 Y390 phosphorylation is required for localization of TSG101 to PML NBs. PML release from PML NBs through PML deSUMOylation contributes to induce MOID. The post-transcriptional/translational cell death machinery and the non-canonical transcriptional regulation are intricately linked to MOID, and ER-MAM, may serve as a crucial intersection for MOID signaling.",

Fifteen patients diagnosed with stage III/grade C periodontitis were included in the cohort. The right and left sides of the mouth were randomly assigned either the conventional SRP (control) group or the SRP supplemented with Nd:YAG laser group (experimental group, 160 mJ, 4 W) in a split-mouth design. Clinical periodontal indices were recorded at baseline and at the 6-week follow-up post-treatment. ELISA was utilised to measure IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in gingival crevicular fluid. The subgingival microbiota\u2019s composition and variations were characterised using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, while quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to analyse the changes in the red-complex bacteria in subgingival plaque. The SRP+Nd group exhibited a statistically significant reduction in record probing depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP) compared to the SRP group after treatment (p<0.05). The SRP+Nd group showed a markedly lower IL-1\u03b2 level than the SRP group (p<0.05). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in the dominant subgingival microbiota composition and level of the red-complex bacteria between the two groups (p>0.05). The adjunctive use of Nd:YAG laser with SRP demonstrates promising short-term therapeutic benefits for patients with extensive stage III/grade C periodontitis.

            "Colorectal cancer has emerged as one of the predominant malignant tumors globally. Immunotherapy, as a novel therapeutic methodology, has opened up new possibilities for colorectal cancer patients. However, its actual clinical efficacy requires further enhancement. Copper, as an exceptionally crucial trace element, can influence various signaling pathways, gene expression, and biological metabolic processes in cells, thus playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Recent studies have revealed that cuproptosis, a novel mode of cell death, holds promise to become a potential target to overcome resistance to colorectal cancer immunotherapy. This shows substantial potential in the combination treatment of colorectal cancer. Conveying copper into tumor cells via a nano-drug delivery system to induce cuproptosis of colorectal cancer cells could offer a potential strategy for eliminating drug-resistant colorectal cancer cells and vastly improving the efficacy of immunotherapy while ultimately destroy colorectal tumors. Moreover, combining the cuproptosis induction strategy with other anti-tumor approaches such as photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and chemodynamic therapy could further enhance its therapeutic effect. This review aims to illuminate the practical significance of cuproptosis and cuproptosis-inducing nano-drugs in colorectal cancer immunotherapy, and scrutinize the current challenges and limitations of this methodology, thereby providing innovative thoughts and references for the advancement of cuproptosis-based colorectal cancer immunotherapy strategies."

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity\u2013response relationship.

Copper, as an exceptionally crucial trace element, can influence various signaling pathways, gene expression, and biological metabolic processes in cells, thus playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Recent studies have revealed that cuproptosis, a novel mode of cell death, holds promise to become a potential target to overcome resistance to colorectal cancer immunotherapy. This shows substantial potential in the combination treatment of colorectal cancer. Conveying copper into tumor cells via a nano-drug delivery system to induce cuproptosis of colorectal cancer cells could offer a potential strategy for eliminating drug-resistant colorectal cancer cells and vastly improving the efficacy of immunotherapy while ultimately destroy colorectal tumors. Moreover, combining the cuproptosis induction strategy with other anti-tumor approaches such as photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and chemodynamic therapy could further enhance its therapeutic effect.

Target was a 6\u2009\u00d7\u200947\u2009mm circumferential segment of atrial wall at LPV antrum. Transmurality was defined as percent of target having >600 volts per centimeter (V/cm) electric field needed for electroporation. Efficiency was 0.9, 1.4, 2.7, 5.9, 10, and 12% for the large 1\u2010shot and 9\u2009mm Nitinol spheres, penta\u2010spline, circular, flex spline, and balloon catheters, respectively. Regarding safety, currents for 90% transmurality were 70, 39,36,12.5, 5.3, and 4\u2009Amps for the same respective catheters, with less being safer. ECD was 124, 25, 74, 83, 41, and 31\u2009A/cm Computer models demonstrated a remarkable range in efficiency among catheters studied. Those having less atrial blood exposure had the highest efficiencies, with factors of up to 13X more efficiency compared to exposed ones. Higher efficiency designs have less collateral current and are safer. Confirmatory in\u2010vivo studies are required.",

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity\u2013response relationship.

Copper, as an exceptionally crucial trace element, can influence various signaling pathways, gene expression, and biological metabolic processes in cells, thus playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Recent studies have revealed that cuproptosis, a novel mode of cell death, holds promise to become a potential target to overcome resistance to colorectal cancer immunotherapy. This shows substantial potential in the combination treatment of colorectal cancer. Conveying copper into tumor cells via a nano-drug delivery system to induce cuproptosis of colorectal cancer cells could offer a potential strategy for eliminating drug-resistant colorectal cancer cells and vastly improving the efficacy of immunotherapy while ultimately destroy colorectal tumors. Moreover, combining the cuproptosis induction strategy with other anti-tumor approaches such as photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and chemodynamic therapy could further enhance its therapeutic effect.

The following catheter designs were compared: penta\u2010spline basket, Nitinol spheres (focal 9\u2009mm and large 1\u2010shot), circular, balloon, and flex\u2010circuit. Target was a 6\u2009\u00d7\u200947\u2009mm circumferential segment of atrial wall at LPV antrum. Transmurality was defined as percent of target having >600 volts per centimeter (V/cm) electric field needed for electroporation. Efficiency was 0.9, 1.4, 2.7, 5.9, 10, and 12% for the large 1\u2010shot and 9\u2009mm Nitinol spheres, penta\u2010spline, circular, flex spline, and balloon catheters, respectively. Regarding safety, currents for 90% transmurality were 70, 39,36,12.5, 5.3, and 4\u2009Amps for the same respective catheters, with less being safer. ECD was 124, 25, 74, 83, 41, and 31\u2009A/cm Computer models demonstrated a remarkable range in efficiency among catheters studied. Those having less atrial blood exposure had the highest efficiencies, with factors of up to 13X more efficiency compared to exposed ones. Higher efficiency designs have less collateral current and are safer. Confirmatory in\u2010vivo studies are required.",

Cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential for regulating bone homeostasis. Osteoclasts, multinucleated giant cells differentiated from macrophage lineage, are responsible for osteolytic bone conditions which are closely linked to ROS signaling pathways. In this study, an anti\u2010ROS enzyme, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) was found to be expressed both in bone marrow macrophages and osteoclasts. Recombinant Prdx1 protein was found to dose\u2010dependently inhibit ROS production and osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, Prdx1 protein also attenuated NFATc1 activation as well as the expression of C\u2010Fos, V\u2010ATPase\u2010d2, Cathepsin K, and Integrin \u03b1V. Collectively, Prdx1 is a negative regulator on osteoclast formation via inhibiting RANKL\u2010mediated ROS activity, thus suggesting its potential application for treating osteoclast related disorders.",
