Oleocanthal (OO), one of the most potent bioactive phenols of extra virgin olive oil, has shown redox modulating properties in vitro. However, its acute, in vivo antioxidant properties have never been studied before. The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of five redox markers (Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances [TBARS] and glutathione peroxidase activity in serum-GPx3 and erythrocytes (GPx1), protein carbonyls in serum) after the consumption different meals. Five different isocaloric meals comprised of white bread and butter (BU) or butter plus ibuprofen (BU-IBU) or olive oil poor in OO or olive oils containing 250 and 500 mg/Kg of oleocanthal (OO250 and OO500, respectively). We hypothesized that OO-rich olive oil will reduce postprandial oxidative stress in T2DM patients compared to other lipid sources. This study involved 10 patients with T2DM and had a cross-over design. The comparison of incremental Area Under Curves (iAUCs) has shown that OO-rich olive oils were able to alleviate the increments of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and GPx3 and induce a higher red blood cells (RBCs) GPx1 activity compared to OO ( P This study demonstrates for the first time that, apart from its anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet properties, OO can also exert acute antioxidant effects.

FINE-REAL is a prospective, single-arm, non-interventional study of patients initiated on finerenone as part of their routine care in accordance with country-approved labels. The study, initiated in June 2022, is expected to be completed by January 2028. The cutoff for this pre-specified interim analysis was June 13, 2023.

The FINE-REAL study (NCT05348733) aims to evaluate the characteristics and treatment patterns of participants treated with finerenone in clinical practice. FINE-REAL is a prospective, single-arm, non-interventional study of patients initiated on finerenone as part of their routine care in accordance with country-approved labels. The study, initiated in June 2022, is expected to be completed by January 2028. The cutoff for this pre-specified interim analysis was June 13, 2023. Participants were recruited across nephrology, endocrinology, cardiology, and primary care settings. Of 556 participants enrolled in the study by the cut-off date, 504 were included in this analysis (median follow-up duration of 7\u00a0months [finerenone treatment initiation to last recorded observation]). At baseline, 76.1% of participants were in the high or very high (KDIGO) CKD risk categories. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were prescribed to 71.8% and 46.6% of participants, respectively. Based on prescribing information, 87.9% and 12.1% of participants initiated finerenone at doses of 10 and 20\u00a0mg, respectively. Finerenone treatment was uninterrupted in 92.3% of participants after 7\u00a0months\u2019 median follow-up. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 110 (21.8%) participants. Hyperkalemia occurred in 25 (5.0%) participants, with no cases leading to death, dialysis, or hospitalization. At this interim analysis, finerenone was initiated in patients with CKD and T2D across various clinical practices participating in the study. Treatment discontinuation and hyperkalemia occurred infrequently. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40620-024-02070-y."

This study aimed to evaluate fundus photographs using artificial intelligence to explore the relationships between diabetic retinopathy (DR), MASLD, and related factors. In this cross-sectional study, we included 1,736 patients with a history of diabetes treatment or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of \u22656.5%. All participants were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody and were selected from 33,022 examinees at a health facility in Japan. Fundus photographs were analyzed using RetCAD software, and DR scores were quantified. The presence of DR was determined using two cutoffs: sensitivity (CO20) and specificity (CO50). Steatotic liver (SL) stages were assessed via ultrasound and fibrosis indices and classified into three groups: no SL (SL0), SL with low fibrosis (SL1), and SL with high fibrosis (SL2). Odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of DR associated with each SL stage were calculated using logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, HbA1c, C-reactive protein level, and alcohol consumption. The risk of DR was lower in the SL1 (OR: 0.63, 0.54) and SL2 (OR: 0.64, 0.77) groups compared to the SL0 group at CO20 for both the Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4) and the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS), respectively. Additionally, higher levels of cholinesterase were consistently associated with a reduced risk of DR (FIB-4: OR 0.52, NFS: OR 0.54) at CO50. This study demonstrates that MASLD was associated with a reduced risk of DR, with cholinesterase levels providing further protective effects, highlighting the need for further research into the protective mechanisms and refinement of DR evaluation techniques.

              "content": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is common in patients with obesity and diabetes and can lead to serious complications. This study aimed to evaluate fundus photographs using artificial intelligence to explore the relationships between diabetic retinopathy (DR), MASLD, and related factors. In this cross-sectional study, we included 1,736 patients with a history of diabetes treatment or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of \u22656.5%. All participants were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody and were selected from 33,022 examinees at a health facility in Japan. Fundus photographs were analyzed using RetCAD software, and DR scores were quantified. The presence of DR was determined using two cutoffs: sensitivity (CO20) and specificity (CO50). Steatotic liver (SL) stages were assessed via ultrasound and fibrosis indices and classified into three groups: no SL (SL0), SL with low fibrosis (SL1), and SL with high fibrosis (SL2). Odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of DR associated with each SL stage were calculated using logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, HbA1c, C-reactive protein level, and alcohol consumption. The risk of DR was lower in the SL1 (OR: 0.63, 0.54) and SL2 (OR: 0.64, 0.77) groups compared to the SL0 group at CO20 for both the Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4) and the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS), respectively. Additionally, higher levels of cholinesterase were consistently associated with a reduced risk of DR (FIB-4: OR 0.52, NFS: OR 0.54) at CO50. This study demonstrates that MASLD was associated with a reduced risk of DR, with cholinesterase levels providing further protective effects, highlighting the need for further research into the protective mechanisms and refinement of DR evaluation techniques. The standardized AI evaluation method for DR offers a reliable approach for analyzing retinal changes.",
