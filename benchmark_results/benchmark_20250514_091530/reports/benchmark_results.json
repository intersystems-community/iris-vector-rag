We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years.
