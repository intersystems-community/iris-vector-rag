  "query": "What are health promotion strategies?",
  "answer": "Based on the information provided in the documents, health promotion strategies aimed at young women to promote physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance should focus on addressing barriers related to motivation, time, cost, social support, and environmental factors. \n\nSpecifically, interventions should be designed to help young women overcome perceived barriers such as lack of motivation, limited time, financial constraints, and insufficient social support in order to engage in regular physical activity and maintain a healthy diet. For instance, programs could include motivational support, time management strategies, financial assistance or subsidies for healthy food options, as well as social support networks to encourage and sustain healthy lifestyle behaviors.\n\nFurthermore, considering the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on weight maintenance barriers, health promotion strategies should take into account the unique challenges faced by young women from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Tailored interventions may be necessary to address specific barriers associated with SES, such as access to affordable healthy foods, safe and supportive environments for physical activity, and resources for managing weight-related issues.\n\nIn summary, health promotion strategies for young women should be multifaceted, targeting personal, social, and environmental factors that influence physical activity and healthy eating habits. By addressing the barriers identified in the documents and considering the implications of socioeconomic status, effective interventions can be developed to support weight maintenance and overall well-being among young women.",

      "page_content": "obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost. Women with children were particularly likely to report a lack of social support as an important barrier to physical activity, and lack of social support and time as important barriers to healthy eating. Perceived barriers did not differ by SES or overweight status. Health promotion strategies aimed at preventing weight gain should take into account the specific perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating faced by women in this age group, particularly lack of motivation, lack of time, and cost. Strategies targeting perceived lack of time and lack of social support are particularly required for young women with children.",

This study examined a range of perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance among young women, and how these varied by socioeconomic status (SES), overweight status and domestic situation. In October-December 2001, a total of 445 women aged 18â€“32 years, selected randomly from the Australian electoral roll, completed a mailed self-report survey that included questions on 11 barriers to physical activity and 11 barriers to healthy eating (relating to personal, social and environmental factors). Height, weight and socio-demographic details were also obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost.",
