  "query": "What are barriers to physical activity?",
  "answer": "Based on the provided documents, the barriers to physical activity among young women include motivation, time, cost, lack of social support, and socioeconomic status. Specifically, young women reported that motivation, time, and cost were common barriers to physical activity and healthy eating. Additionally, women with children were more likely to cite lack of social support as a barrier to physical activity. The study also indicated that young women, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status, face personal, social, and environmental barriers to weight maintenance.\n\nIt is important to note that the information provided is based on statistical analyses conducted in mid-2003 and a community survey, so there may be some uncertainty regarding the current relevance of these findings. Additionally, the documents do not provide comprehensive information about all potential barriers to physical activity, so there may be other factors to consider as well.",

The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost. Women with children were particularly likely to report a lack of social support as an important barrier to physical activity, and lack of social support and time as important barriers to healthy eating. Perceived barriers did not differ by SES or overweight status. Health promotion strategies aimed at preventing weight gain should take into account the specific perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating faced by women in this age group, particularly lack of motivation, lack of time, and cost. Strategies targeting perceived lack of time and lack of social support are particularly required for young women with children.",

This study examined a range of perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance among young women, and how these varied by socioeconomic status (SES), overweight status and domestic situation. In October-December 2001, a total of 445 women aged 18â€“32 years, selected randomly from the Australian electoral roll, completed a mailed self-report survey that included questions on 11 barriers to physical activity and 11 barriers to healthy eating (relating to personal, social and environmental factors). Height, weight and socio-demographic details were also obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost.",
