  "query": "What are health promotion strategies?",
  "answer": "Based on the available documents, health promotion strategies for young women, particularly in relation to physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance, involve addressing various perceived barriers. Some of the common barriers identified include lack of motivation, time constraints, cost, and lack of social support. \n\nIt is noted that women with children are more likely to face a lack of social support as a barrier to physical activity and time constraints as a barrier to healthy eating. The study also suggests that young women, as a group, are at high risk of weight gain, indicating the importance of targeted health promotion strategies.\n\nTo address these barriers and promote health among young women, health promotion strategies may include interventions focused on increasing motivation for physical activity and healthy eating, providing education on time management skills related to healthy behaviors, offering affordable options for nutritious foods and exercise programs, and creating supportive environments that encourage social support for health-related goals.\n\nIt is important to consider the potential variations in perceived barriers based on socioeconomic status (SES) and overweight status among young women when designing and implementing health promotion strategies. By addressing these barriers through targeted interventions and creating supportive environments, health promotion efforts can be more effective in promoting healthy behaviors and weight maintenance among young women.",

The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost. Women with children were particularly likely to report a lack of social support as an important barrier to physical activity, and lack of social support and time as important barriers to healthy eating. Perceived barriers did not differ by SES or overweight status. Health promotion strategies aimed at preventing weight gain should take into account the specific perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating faced by women in this age group, particularly lack of motivation, lack of time, and cost. Strategies targeting perceived lack of time and lack of social support are particularly required for young women with children.",

This study examined a range of perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance among young women, and how these varied by socioeconomic status (SES), overweight status and domestic situation. In October-December 2001, a total of 445 women aged 18â€“32 years, selected randomly from the Australian electoral roll, completed a mailed self-report survey that included questions on 11 barriers to physical activity and 11 barriers to healthy eating (relating to personal, social and environmental factors). Height, weight and socio-demographic details were also obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost.",
