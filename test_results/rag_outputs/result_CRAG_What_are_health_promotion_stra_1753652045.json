  "query": "What are health promotion strategies?",
  "answer": "Based on the information provided from the two documents, health promotion strategies focus on addressing barriers to physical activity and healthy eating among young women, particularly in the context of weight maintenance. Some common barriers identified include lack of motivation, time constraints, cost, lack of social support, and environmental factors.\n\nSpecifically, young women face challenges related to maintaining a healthy lifestyle due to various factors such as lack of time and social support. Women with children were found to report a lack of social support as a significant barrier to physical activity, while lack of social support and time were identified as barriers to healthy eating. Additionally, young women as a group are at higher risk of weight gain, indicating the importance of targeting this population with health promotion strategies.\n\nIt is important to note that the information provided is limited and may not capture the full range of barriers to health promotion among young women. Further research and data collection may be needed to develop comprehensive health promotion strategies that effectively address the specific needs and challenges faced by this population.",

The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost. Women with children were particularly likely to report a lack of social support as an important barrier to physical activity, and lack of social support and time as important barriers to healthy eating. Perceived barriers did not differ by SES or overweight status. Health promotion strategies aimed at preventing weight gain should take into account the specific perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating faced by women in this age group, particularly lack of motivation, lack of time, and cost. Strategies targeting perceived lack of time and lack of social support are particularly required for young women with children.",

This study examined a range of perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance among young women, and how these varied by socioeconomic status (SES), overweight status and domestic situation. In October-December 2001, a total of 445 women aged 18â€“32 years, selected randomly from the Australian electoral roll, completed a mailed self-report survey that included questions on 11 barriers to physical activity and 11 barriers to healthy eating (relating to personal, social and environmental factors). Height, weight and socio-demographic details were also obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost.",
