  "query": "What are health promotion strategies?",
  "answer": "Based on the provided documents, health promotion strategies for young women in relation to physical activity and healthy eating include addressing perceived barriers such as motivation, time, cost, and lack of social support. The documents highlight that women with children are particularly affected by a lack of social support when it comes to engaging in physical activity and healthy eating. In addition, there is a focus on addressing barriers related to weight maintenance among young women, especially those at high risk of weight gain. Strategies may need to take into account socioeconomic status as barriers to physical activity and healthy eating habits may vary based on SES.\n\nIt is important to note that the information provided is based on studies conducted in the mid-2000s, and there may be additional or updated research on health promotion strategies for young women since then. Furthermore, the extent to which these barriers impact individuals may vary and addressing them effectively may require a multi-faceted approach that considers individual circumstances and needs.",

The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost. Women with children were particularly likely to report a lack of social support as an important barrier to physical activity, and lack of social support and time as important barriers to healthy eating. Perceived barriers did not differ by SES or overweight status. Health promotion strategies aimed at preventing weight gain should take into account the specific perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating faced by women in this age group, particularly lack of motivation, lack of time, and cost. Strategies targeting perceived lack of time and lack of social support are particularly required for young women with children.",

This study examined a range of perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance among young women, and how these varied by socioeconomic status (SES), overweight status and domestic situation. In October-December 2001, a total of 445 women aged 18â€“32 years, selected randomly from the Australian electoral roll, completed a mailed self-report survey that included questions on 11 barriers to physical activity and 11 barriers to healthy eating (relating to personal, social and environmental factors). Height, weight and socio-demographic details were also obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost.",
