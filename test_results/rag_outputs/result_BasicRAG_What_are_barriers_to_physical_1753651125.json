  "query": "What are barriers to physical activity?",
  "answer": "Based on the information provided in the context documents, the barriers to physical activity identified among young women include lack of motivation, lack of time, and cost. Additionally, women with children were more likely to report a lack of social support as an important barrier to physical activity. The perceived barriers did not differ by socioeconomic status (SES) or overweight status. \n\nOverall, the main barriers to physical activity among young women were related to internal factors such as motivation, external factors like time constraints, financial limitations, and lack of social support, particularly for women with children. More information on specific strategies targeting these barriers and their effectiveness in promoting physical activity among young women may be needed for a more comprehensive understanding.",

In October-December 2001, a total of 445 women aged 18–32 years, selected randomly from the Australian electoral roll, completed a mailed self-report survey that included questions on 11 barriers to physical activity and 11 barriers to healthy eating (relating to personal, social and environmental factors).
