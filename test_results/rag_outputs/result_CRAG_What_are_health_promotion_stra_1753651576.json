  "query": "What are health promotion strategies?",
  "answer": "Based on the available documents, health promotion strategies for young women, particularly in the context of weight maintenance, include addressing perceived barriers related to motivation, time, cost, social support, and environmental factors. These barriers can impact their ability to engage in physical activity and maintain a healthy diet.\n\nDocument 1 highlights that common barriers to physical activity and healthy eating among young women are related to motivation, time, cost, and social support. Women with children may face additional challenges, such as lack of social support for physical activity and time constraints for healthy eating. Therefore, health promotion strategies could focus on addressing these specific barriers through interventions that target motivation, time management skills, affordability of healthy foods, and social support networks for physical activity and healthy eating.\n\nDocument 2 further emphasizes the importance of understanding perceived personal, social, and environmental barriers to weight maintenance among young women. The study suggests that factors such as socioeconomic status and overweight status may influence the specific barriers faced by young women. Health promotion strategies should consider these factors when designing interventions aimed at promoting healthy behaviors and weight maintenance among young women.\n\nIn conclusion, health promotion strategies for young women should address barriers related to motivation, time, cost, social support, and environmental factors in order to promote physical activity, healthy eating, and weight maintenance. It is important for interventions to consider the individual needs and circumstances of young women, including their socioeconomic status and weight status, in order to effectively promote long-term health and well-being.",

      "page_content": "obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost. Women with children were particularly likely to report a lack of social support as an important barrier to physical activity, and lack of social support and time as important barriers to healthy eating. Perceived barriers did not differ by SES or overweight status. Health promotion strategies aimed at preventing weight gain should take into account the specific perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating faced by women in this age group, particularly lack of motivation, lack of time, and cost. Strategies targeting perceived lack of time and lack of social support are particularly required for young women with children.",

This study examined a range of perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance among young women, and how these varied by socioeconomic status (SES), overweight status and domestic situation. In October-December 2001, a total of 445 women aged 18â€“32 years, selected randomly from the Australian electoral roll, completed a mailed self-report survey that included questions on 11 barriers to physical activity and 11 barriers to healthy eating (relating to personal, social and environmental factors). Height, weight and socio-demographic details were also obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost.",
