  │ (python_full_version == '3.10.*'):
  ╰─▶ Because the requested Python version (>=3.10) does not satisfy
      Python>=3.11 and iris-vector-graph>=1.1.1 depends on Python>=3.11, we
      can conclude that iris-vector-graph>=1.1.1 cannot be used.
      And because only the following versions of iris-vector-graph are
      available:
          iris-vector-graph<=1.1.1
          iris-vector-graph==1.1.2
          iris-vector-graph==1.1.3
          iris-vector-graph==1.1.4
          iris-vector-graph==1.1.5
          iris-vector-graph==1.1.6
          iris-vector-graph==1.1.7
      we can conclude that iris-vector-graph>=1.1.1 cannot be used.
      And because iris-vector-rag[embedding] depends on
      iris-vector-graph>=1.1.1 and your project requires
      iris-vector-rag[embedding], we can conclude that your project's
      requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: The `requires-python` value (>=3.10) includes Python versions that
      are not supported by your dependencies (e.g., iris-vector-graph>=1.1.1
      only supports >=3.11). Consider using a more restrictive
      `requires-python` value (like >=3.11).

      hint: While the active Python version is 3.12, the resolution failed for
      other Python versions supported by your project. Consider limiting your
      project's supported Python versions using `requires-python`.
