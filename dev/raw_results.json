To provide a comprehensive answer, the following information would be helpful:\n\n1. Mechanism of action of metformin in the body.\n2. Clinical outcomes associated with metformin use in type 2 diabetes patients, such as blood sugar control, weight management, and cardiovascular benefits.\n3. Potential side effects or contraindications of metformin.\n4. Comparison of metformin with other diabetes medications.\n5. Long-term effects of metformin on diabetes progression and complications.\n\nWithout this information, I cannot provide a detailed answer regarding the effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes.",
