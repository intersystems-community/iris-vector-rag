      "answer": "Metformin is a commonly prescribed medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It works by decreasing glucose production in the liver and increasing insulin sensitivity in the muscles. Some of the effects of metformin include lowering blood sugar levels, reducing insulin resistance, and improving overall glucose metabolism in the body. Additionally, metformin has been shown to have some potential benefits beyond its primary use in diabetes management, such as weight loss and potential cardiovascular protective effects.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the effects of metformin may vary from person to person and additional research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms of action and potential side effects. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare provider before starting or changing any medication regimen.",
