Within this framework, the present study aims at improving the recovery of phenolic compounds from Merlot and Garganega pomace and at contributing to the scientific background of enzyme-assisted extraction. Five commercial cellulolytic enzymes were tested in different conditions. Phenolic compound extraction yields were analyzed via a Design of Experiments (DoE) methodology and a second extraction step with acetone was sequentially added. According to DoE, 2% <italic toggle="yes">w/w</italic> enzyme/substrate ratio was more effective than 1%, allowing a higher total phenol recovery, while the effect of incubation time (2 or 4 h) variation was more enzyme-dependent. Extracts were characterized via spectrophotometric and HPLC-DAD analyses. The results proved that enzymatic and acetone Merlot and Garganega pomace extracts were complex mixtures of compounds. The use of different cellulolytic enzymes led to different extract compositions, as demonstrated using PCA models. The enzyme effects were observed both in water enzymatic and in the subsequent acetone extracts, probably due to their specific grape cell wall degradation and leading to the recovery of different molecule arrays.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>by-products</kwd><kwd>chemometrics</kwd><kwd>enzymatic extraction</kwd><kwd>Garganega</kwd><kwd>grape pomace</kwd><kwd>Merlot</kwd><kwd>phenolic compounds</kwd><kwd>organic solvents</kwd><kwd>RP-HPLC-DAD</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program</funding-source><award-id>688338</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>FCT</funding-source><award-id>UIDB/04077/2020</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Foundation for Science and Technology</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>MCTES</funding-source><award-id>UIDP/04077/2020</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>ESF (European Social Fund)</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>individual PhD research grant</funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/146080/2019</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Associate Laboratory for Green Chemistry&#x02013;LAQV</funding-source><award-id>UIDB/50006/2020</award-id><award-id>UIDP/50006/2020</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the NoAW project (&#x02018;&#x02018;Innovative approaches to turn agricultural waste into ecological and economic assets&#x0201d;), founded by the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the grant agreement No 688338.

Introduction</title><p>Grape is one of the most cultivated crops in the world with an estimated production in 2020 of more than 78 million tons, especially in China, Italy, Spain, France and the United States of America [<xref rid="B1-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In its statistical report, the Organization of Vine and Wine reported that 77.8 million tons of grape were produced in 2018 of which 57% was of wine grape, 36% of table grape and 7% of dried grape [<xref rid="B2-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Grapes are very interesting from a nutritional point of view, due to their vitamin and mineral contents, and are also rich in numerous phenolic compounds that are distributed in the pulp (10%), seeds (60&#x02013;70%) and skin (28&#x02013;35%). These compounds are mainly responsible for wine color, taste, mouth feel and oxidation level [<xref rid="B3-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Winemaking is a seasonal activity that, yearly and for a short period, produces large quantities of waste (e.g., 10 million tons in 2018) [<xref rid="B4-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], causing a serious environmental problem [<xref rid="B5-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Winery by-products represent more than 30% of the grapes used for winemaking [<xref rid="B6-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], among which a large amount of wastewater and organic wastes are generated [<xref rid="B7-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The most abundant winemaking by-product is grape pomace (GP), which consists mainly of pressed skins, seeds and stems [<xref rid="B8-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is estimated that 1 kg of GP is generated for each 6 L of wine [<xref rid="B11-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>GP can be disposed as natural waste or used as compost or animal feed, even though its phenolic content could be a limiting factor for those applications as it may inhibit plant germination or reduce feed digestibility [<xref rid="B12-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, the disposal option could be environmentally detrimental given the presence of phenolic compounds that decrease the GP pH while increasing its resistance to biological degradation [<xref rid="B13-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. GP can be also used to extract tartaric acid, to produce ethanol, biochar, biopolymers and composites [<xref rid="B10-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>More sustainable seems to be the extraction of GP bioactive compounds, which could also be more economically viable than other valorization options allowing the recovery of valuable phenolic compounds, dietary fibers and oils [<xref rid="B10-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The spectrum of extractable compounds may vary according to the differences between red and white winemaking processes [<xref rid="B8-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B14-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Anthocyanins are the main polyphenolic compounds in red grapes while flavanols are more abundant in white grape varieties [<xref rid="B16-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Amongst the GP components, qualitative and quantitative variations in phenolic composition can be detected [<xref rid="B17-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]: Skins are rich in anthocyanins and flavonols [<xref rid="B16-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], seeds are rich in procyanidins [<xref rid="B19-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and flavanols such as catechin and epicatechin [<xref rid="B16-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], stems are rich in tannins [<xref rid="B20-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and flavanols [<xref rid="B17-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. After winemaking, considerable amounts of such bioactive molecules remain in GP vegetable tissues [<xref rid="B11-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], making their extraction an attractive, sustainable and cost-effective option for food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Several GP phenolics showed beneficial activities like antioxidant, inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, anti-inflammatory and anti-cholesterol properties, or were used as natural food colorants and additives for functional foods [<xref rid="B12-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The extraction of phenolics from GP is hampered by plant cell walls which may entrap such compounds (present either in free or bound forms), making the hydrolyzation/disruption of the cell wall a compulsory step [<xref rid="B21-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consequently, the selection of the extraction method is very important as it may greatly affect the yield and type of the isolated compounds [<xref rid="B22-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Common processes include liquid-liquid and solid-liquid extractions and the use of solvents such as ethanol, methanol or acetone. The extraction efficiency can be optimized through the testing of different solvents, GP particle size, incubation temperature and time [<xref rid="B13-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B22-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For example, a lower particle size increases the superficial area available for mass transfer [<xref rid="B23-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], while moderate temperatures should be used since several phenolic compounds are heat sensitive [<xref rid="B19-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. More recently, greener processes have also been applied, such as natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) [<xref rid="B24-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], supercritical fluids (SFE) [<xref rid="B25-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or pressurized liquid (PLE) [<xref rid="B9-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B26-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] extractions.</p><p>In addition, the use of enzymes (single or in combination) could be a valuable resource to optimize the extraction process since they can enhance the release of the phenolic compounds bound to the GP cell structures, increasing the extraction yield. Cellulases, pectinases, tannases, glucoamylases and proteases are the most used enzymes in the recovery of bioactive compounds in grape by-products [<xref rid="B4-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although the use of enzymes for the isolation of phenolics is not innovative, the number of studies focusing on the functional characteristics and industrial applicability of the extracts obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis has been largely growing in the last 20 years, also because this extraction strategy is considered technologically promising and green [<xref rid="B4-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. With respect to phenolic compounds, the enzyme-assisted extraction consists of the hydrolysis of cell wall macromolecules in order to release crosslinked molecules, and in the release of phenolics stored in the vacuoles. The adoption of this technology presents several advantages such as avoided use of toxic solvents, reduced extraction time, extracts obtained through environmentally friendly methods [<xref rid="B4-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The new trends in the use of enzymes for the recovery of phenols from grape byproducts were recently reviewed [<xref rid="B4-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the recovery of GP compounds using enzymatic hydrolysis was considered in line with the industry needs of new low-cost technologies and profit maximization, and with the consumer demand for increasingly sustainable products. The study pointed out decreased enzyme costs for industrial-scale processes with respect to lab-scale processes and the possible use of immobilized enzymes that can be recovered from the extract and reused, making the process cheaper [<xref rid="B4-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this work was to set up a new phenol extraction protocol (by combining enzyme and solvent-base methods) to be applied to white and red GP, aiming at higher extraction yields. Five commercial cellulolytic enzymes (Pentopan Mono BG, Pectinex Ultra SPL, Celluclast, Driselase, Viscozyme) and 75% (<italic toggle="yes">v/v</italic>) acetone were tested. A Design of Experiments (DoE) procedure was carried out in order to find the best extraction conditions and minimize the reagent and energy use without decreasing the extraction yield. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that evaluates the effect of these different enzymes in a combined water-enzyme assisted extraction followed by an acetone extraction and on the bioactive compounds extracts composition. The results on the different recovered classes of compounds were further elaborated by PCA and differences among the extraction performances and effects of different enzymes evaluated. The collected results have increased the scientific background supporting a compound-specific enzyme-assisted extraction in view of a more targeted scale-up and industrial exploitation. Finally, the work contributes to the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (<uri xlink:href="https://sdgs.un.org/">https://sdgs.un.org/</uri>, accessed on 9 October 2022), and in particular to Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Reduction), which focuses on reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-foods-12-00959"><title>2.

Statistical Analysis</title><p>In order to find the best extraction conditions, a design of experiments (DoE) procedure was carried out [<xref rid="B35-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This method considered the operational variables (in this case percentage of enzyme, incubation time and type of enzyme) as factors, or independent variables, and the extracted phenolic compound contents as response or dependent variable. Successively, the DoE indicated which experiments should be carried out to better describe the entire experimental domain, (the &#x0201c;region&#x0201d; spanned by the combinations minima and maxima values of the factors) and, once the experiments had been executed, computed a model which can be used to find the best factor combination for further analyses. In this case, the best factor combination was the one that maximizes the yield of extracted phenols. A full-factorial DoE with three factors was applied: Two of them (enzyme/substrate ratio (<italic toggle="yes">ratio</italic>) and incubation time (<italic toggle="yes">time</italic>)) are continuous with two levels (codified as &#x02212;1 and +1), the third (enzyme type (<italic toggle="yes">type</italic>)) is a categorical variable with five levels.

In this first set of experiments, only enzymatic treatments were performed. A full-factorial DoE was applied, considering all variable combinations, with 20 experiments carried out for each GP type.

All the tested enzymatic treatments were able to increase the amount of extracted phenols (up to averages of 40.9% and 24.9% of the samples after the five enzymatic treatments on white and red GP, respectively, 2 h incubation) when compared to the relative control GP samples incubated at the same conditions without enzyme (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). By extending the incubation time to 4 h, total levels of extracted compounds were slightly increased, but mainly in the controls. Therefore, the effect of the enzymes after 4 h was less incisive, when compared to related controls at 4 h, and the improved yields were, on average among the five enzymatic treatments, only 15.9% and 10.7% for white and red GP, respectively (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the amounts of total phenols in the enzymatic extracts were on average 26.0 and 25.0 mg GAeq/gDW, for red and white GP, respectively, considering both 2 h and 4 h data (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

Finally, the square term of <italic toggle="yes">type</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">type</italic><sup>2</sup>) was not significant for both models, indicating the presence of a linear trend for the variable <italic toggle="yes">type</italic>. The square terms of <italic toggle="yes">time</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ratio</italic> could not be calculated because only two levels for these factors were considered.</p><p>The best extraction conditions could be evaluated by considering the response surface, in which the values of the response were calculated in all experimental domains, between minimum and maximum levels of the factors. <italic toggle="yes">Type</italic> was a categorical variable; therefore, only the values calculated for its five levels (i.e., the five different enzymes) had chemical meaning, the intermediate ones were mathematically computed, but these points could not be chemically reached.

Previous literature concerning phenolic compound extraction from GP did not generally report data on protein levels. Instead, when GP was treated with proteases a water-soluble extract with anti-inflammatory activity and containing peptides, carbohydrates, lipids and polyphenols (mainly flavonoids and phenolic acids), was obtained [<xref rid="B39-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

The present high levels of catechins make the extracts promising for further exploitation. For example, it was demonstrated that a Merlot GP extract rich in catechins and anthocyanins was able to improve the oxidative and inflammatory state of rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis [<xref rid="B41-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>The second phytochemical family largely present was that of hydroxybenzoic acids, which includes gallic, protocatechuic, vanillic, and syringic acids.

The only exception was syringic acid, which was increased by 54.5% in Celluclast enzymatic extract of Merlot GP with respect to control (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These data are in agreement with the findings of Meini [<xref rid="B12-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that identified syringic acid as the major component of red GP (mixed cultivars) extract with an increase after cellulase treatment. Other identified flavonols were quercetin and its derivative rutin. Quercetin was present only in acetone extracts, while rutin was detected only in Garganega samples (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Two stilbenes were also identified: <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-piceid and, in lower amount, <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-resveratrol.

The scores clearly indicated that the two extraction methods brought different results because the enzymatic and acetone sample clusters were sharply separated in both GP (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a,c). Interestingly, the loading plots (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b,d) allowed evaluation of the extraction efficiency of the two solvents.

For both GP types, enzymes extracted more proteins, anthocyanins, and tannins, while acetone showed a better performance in the release of flavonoids and flavanols. In white GP samples, phenolic compounds were clearly extracted in higher amounts using acetone while reducing sugars using an enzymatic treatment (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>d). Instead, in the case of red GP samples, both corresponding loadings had a high positive value of PC2, and PC1 values near zero (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b), indicating that reducing sugars and phenols could be efficiently extracted from Merlot GP pomace both by enzymes and by acetone.</p><p>To compare the extracting performances of the five enzymes, two PCA for each GP type were calculated, splitting the obtained results according to data collected on enzymatic and acetone samples (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="foods-12-00959-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). <xref rid="foods-12-00959-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows the two PCA models for red Merlot GP, in which each score, corresponding to a specific enzyme, was identified by a different color (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a,c). The good grouping of data of the four replicates (two biological analyzed in two technical replicates each) of each enzyme treatment (except for one replicate of Viscozyme in acetone sample, <xref rid="foods-12-00959-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>c) indicated a good reproducibility of the extraction procedures. The most interesting task, however, was to compare scores and loadings for both enzymatic and acetone extractions, to check which method combination could be considered the most appropriate for each compound family. The PCA model of enzymatic water extracts (62.3% of explained variance carried by PC1 and PC2, <xref rid="foods-12-00959-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a,b) indicated that Cellucast (high positive values of PC1) extracted flavanols and anthocyanins better; Driselase (negative values of PC2) was more efficient for flavonoids; Pectinex and Pentopan showed a similar behavior (both with high positive values of PC2) and were more suitable for the extraction of proteins and tannins; Viscozyme (high negative values of PC1) was more suitable for total phenols, reducing sugars, and, to a lower extent, for flavonoids and proteins.</p><p>While the data (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) analyzed for PCA of <xref rid="foods-12-00959-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a,b were directly dependent on the enzyme hydrolytic action on GP structure and consequent molecule release in the water solution, the acetone data (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) analyzed in PCA of <xref rid="foods-12-00959-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>c,d depended both on acetone extraction capacity (equal for all samples) and on the different GP hydrolysis previously performed by the used enzymes.</p><p>The PCA acetone model (60.0% of explained variance carried by PC1 and PC2, <xref rid="foods-12-00959-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>c,d) indicated the effect on compound release by acetone of former enzymatic hydrolysis with Cellucast and Pentopan having similar negative values for PC1 and being more suitable mostly for flavonoids and flavanols; Pectinex and Viscozyme (high positive values of PC1) allowed a higher extraction of anthocyanins, reducing sugars, and, partially, total phenols; Driselase, instead, had scores grouped close to the origin, seemed to be not particularly suitable for the following acetone extraction of any of the considered species.</p><p>PCA models for white Garganega GP (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) showed no clear division of score groups, both in water enzymatic and in acetone solvents. A partial separation was present in the enzymatic PCA model (60.6% of explained variance carried by PC1 and PC2; <xref rid="foods-12-00959-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>a,b) only for Cellucast (high positive values of PC2) and Pentopan (negative values of PC2), indicating that the first enzyme could be preferred for the extraction of flavanols, reducing sugars and anthocyanins, and the second for tannins. These results indicated that, in general, for Garganega GP and in both extraction conditions (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>c,d), all the five considered enzymes behaved similarly and none of them appeared to be more specific for the extraction of any of the considered chemical species.</p><p>Data on the GP extracted compounds presented in <xref rid="foods-12-00959-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="foods-12-00959-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and elaborated via PCA (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="foods-12-00959-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="foods-12-00959-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), reflected the effects of the different used enzymes. Enzyme-assisted hydrolysation of cell wall polysaccharides and other macromolecules allows the release of compounds (phenolics, sugars, proteins, etc) linked to cell wall structures, or facilitates the recovery of compounds stored into the vacuole [<xref rid="B4-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These released molecules were recovered in water enzymatic extracts (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="foods-12-00959-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and differences among digestates composition (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>c,d and <xref rid="foods-12-00959-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>c,d) could be ascribed to the diverse enzyme specificities by hydrolysing different cell wall macromolecular components (Methods, <xref rid="sec2dot2-foods-12-00959" ref-type="sec">Section 2.2</xref>). As an example, Viscozyme cellulolytic enzyme mixture released reducing sugars from Merlot GP (<xref rid="foods-12-00959-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>g and <xref rid="foods-12-00959-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) coherently with the proposed xylo-oligosaccharide production activity detected in red Syrah GP [<xref rid="B40-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Meini and coworkers [<xref rid="B12-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] related the phenolic compound extraction yields to the Celluclast hydrolysation effect on red GP cellulosic fibres where phenolics are bound.</p><p>Most of the published studies about GP enzyme-assisted extraction only considered the enzymatic step, while few researchers have proved that phenol recovery can be further improved with a second step solvent extraction [<xref rid="B8-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B14-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For example, Ferri and colleagues used ethanol to extract phenols, flavonoids and tannins from Sangiovese and Montepulciano GP [<xref rid="B8-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and from Trebbiano and Verdicchio GP [<xref rid="B14-foods-12-00959" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] after different enzymatic treatments aimed at achieving bioactive extracts which are useful for food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-foods-12-00959"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>The present study investigated the extraction of phenolic molecules and other compounds from grape pomace (GP; Merlot and Garganega cultivars) by means of five different cellulolytic enzymes and the effects of such treatments on the additional acetone extraction step. According to DoE (design of experiments) analyses, a higher enzyme/substrate ratio (2% <italic toggle="yes">w/w</italic> in comparison to 1%) was required for a more efficient total phenolic compounds recovery, while incubation time did not have a significant impact and was more enzyme-dependent. Among the assayed enzymes, Celluclast led to higher extraction yields from both GP types, followed by Pentopan Mono BG (for red Merlot GP) and then Viscozyme (for white Garganega GP). PCA models highlighted the differences among extracts. The results and their PCA analysis proved that both Merlot and Garganega pomace extracts were a complex mixture of compounds and that the use of different cellulolytic enzymes can lead to different extract compositions, both in water enzymatic and in acetone extracts. For both GP types, enzymatic solutions extracted more anthocyanins, tannins and proteins, while acetone showed better performances for flavonoids and flavanols. In Garganega GP, phenols were clearly extracted in higher amounts using acetone and reducing sugars using enzymes, while, in the case of Merlot GP, reducing sugars and phenols can both be efficiently extracted using enzymes and acetone.</p><p>Most interestingly, for the first time the effects of the used enzymes were observed both in water enzymatic and in the further acetone extracts, due to the specific grape cell wall degradation and consequent possibility to recover different spectra of molecules. Therefore, the present study allowed the evaluation of the specific GP cell wall deconstruction effect also on the second solvent extraction step, while most of the scientific studies concerning GP enzyme-assisted extraction only considered the enzymatic step.</p><p>The application of the enzymes can represent an effective way to enhance the extraction yields or even to try to optimize/reduce the use of solvents. A further interesting step could be the hydrolysis of GP by using immobilized enzymes, therefore allowing their recovery and reuse. Improved processing conditions for the isolation of valuable compounds from GP represents an additional revenue for the wine industry, a cheap source of phenolics and other compounds for other type of industries and a further effort toward diminishing food industry environmental burdens.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
