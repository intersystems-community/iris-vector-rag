            "A randomised trial has previously been repeated in which 437 women with node positive breast cancer received either a 12-week chemohormonal regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, vincristine, prednisone, adriamycin and tamoxifen or 36 weeks of CMFVP. The present analysis concerns the local recurrence rates for the 122 lumpectomy patients who did not receive breast irradiation. The cumulative rate of local breast recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.02. Similarly, in the lumpectomy patients, the cumulative rate of distant recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.04. In conclusion, our results suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy impacts on local breast recurrence in a similar manner to other sites in Stage II breast cancer patients treated by lumpectomy without radiation. Despite the use of a conventional 36-week adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, the local breast recurrence rate was substantial.",

            "Infectious bronchitis is highly contagious and constitutes one of the most common and difficult poultry diseases to control. IBV is endemic in probably all countries that raise chickens. It exists as dozens of serotypes/genotypes. Only a few amino acid differences in the S1 protein of vaccine and challenge strains of IBV may result in poor protection. Tropism of IBV includes the respiratory tract tissues, proventriculus and caecal tonsils of the alimentary tract, the oviduct and the kidney. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain closely related to Massachusetts (Mass) serotype was isolated from broiler chickens suffering from severe renal and respiratory distresses. The isolate was serologically identified by Dot-ELISA and further characterized by RT-PCR then genotyped using S1 gene sequence analysis. Alignment of the S1 sequence of the isolate with 16 IBV strains revealed high homology to isolates related to Mass serotype. Inoculation with the strain reproduced the disease in experi...",

We measured the cognitive style of patients with FMS to assess personality styles in 44 patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) by comparing them with 43 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 41 healthy controls (HC). Personality styles were measured by the Sociotropy and Autonomy Scale (SAS) and the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS). The Structured Clinical interview for DSM Axis I was applied to Axis I disorders, while the Beck Depression Inventory was used to measure depression severity. Patients with FMS in general have a sociotropic personality style similar to patients with MDD, and different from HC, but FMS patients without a lifetime history of MDD had a cognitive personality style different from patients with MDD and similar to HC. These findings suggest that a depressotypic personality style is related to depressive disorder, but not to FMS."

Early diagnosis by measurement of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and treatment can prevent and reduce disease complications, especially fractures. As there is no comprehensive study in Iran, this study designed to assess BMD discrepancy in 20\u201369 yr Tehran population as well as prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia. 553 people (34% men, 66%women) from 50 Blocks in Tehran randomly selected. The assessment of BMD in spine and femur region performed through DXA method. All subjects clinically examined and their BMIs determined. The average spinal BMD score in men were more than in women. The peak bone mass of spine bone both in men and women occurred during 20\u201329 yr and reduction began from the age of 40. At the age of 60 to 69, loose of bone density was 19.6% in lumbar spine and 18.5% in femur of women and also 7.9% in lumbar spine and 14.6% in femur of men.

            "Whether epidural analgesia for labor prolongs the active-first and second labor stages and increases the risk of vacuum-assisted delivery is a controversial topic. Our study was conducted to answer the question: does lumbar epidural analgesia with lidocaine affect the progress of labor in our obstetric population? 395 healthy, nulliparous women, at term, presented in spontaneous labor with a singleton vertex presentation. These patients were randomized to receive analgesia either, epidural with bolus doses of 1% lidocaine or intravenous, with meperidine 25 to 50 mg when their cervix was dilated to 4 centimeters. The duration of the active-first and second stages of labor and the neonatal apgar scores were recorded, in each patient. The total number of vacuum-assisted and cesarean deliveries were also measured. 197 women were randomized to the epidural group. 198 women were randomized to the single-dose intravenous meperidine group. There was no statistical difference in rates of vacuum...",

We have done a meta-analysis of these results to give a more balanced view of the total evidence and to increase statistical precision. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) was performed comparing RT treatment for DCIS of breast cancer to observation. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, Cochrane Library databases, Trial registers, bibliographic databases, and recent issues of relevant journals were searched. Relevant reports were reviewed by two reviewers independently and the references from these reports were searched for additional trials, using guidelines set by QUOROM statement criteria. The reviewers identified four large RCTs, yielding 3665 patients. Pooled results from this four random...",

This study examines the demographic characteristics, neighborhood opportunity and specific-physical activity behaviors associated with distances traveled to destinations used for recreational physical activity. A secondary analysis was undertaken of data (n = 1006) from a survey of Western Australian adults. Road network distances between respondents' homes and 1) formal recreational facilities; 2) beaches and rivers; and 3) parks and ovals used for physical activity were determined. Associations between distances to destinations and demographic characteristics, neighborhood opportunity (number of destinations within 1600 meters of household), and physical activity behaviors were examined. Overall, 56.3% of respondents had used a formal recreational facility, 39.9% a beach or river, and 38.7% a park or oval. The mean distance travele...",
            "Cohort studies are recommended for understanding ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease. Our objective was to review the process for identifying, including, and excluding ethnic minority populations in published cardiovascular cohort studies in Europe and North America. We found the literature using Medline (1966\u20132005), Embase (1980\u20132001), Cinahl, Web of Science, and citations from references; consultations with colleagues; Internet searches; and RB's personal files. A total of 72 studies were included, 39 starting after 1975. Decision-making on inclusion and exclusion of racial/ethnic groups, the conceptual basis of race/ethnicity, and methods of classification of racial/ethnic groups were rarely explicit. Few publications provided details on the racial/ethnic composition of the study setting or sample, and 39 gave no description. Several studies were located in small towns or in occupational settings, where ethnic minority populations are underrepresented. Studies on general po..."

            "We describe the basic tenets of the current concepts of cancer biology, and review the recent advances on the suppressor role of senescence in tumor growth and the breakdown of this barrier during the origin of tumor growth. Senescence phenotype can be induced by (1) telomere attrition-induced senescence at the end of the cellular mitotic life span (MLS*) and (2) also by replication history-independent, accelerated senescence due to inadvertent activation of oncogenes or by exposure of cells to genotoxins. Tumor suppressor genes p53/pRB/p16INK4A and related senescence checkpoints are involved in effecting the onset of senescence. However, senescence as a tumor suppressor mechanism is a leaky process and senescent cells with mutations or epimutations in these genes escape mitotic catastrophe-induced cell death by becoming polyploid cells. These polyploid giant cells, before they die, give rise to several cells with viable genomes via nuclear budding and asymmetric cytokinesis. This mode...",
            "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a pathogenic hepatic flavivirus with a single stranded RNA genome. It has a high genetic variability and is classified into six major genotypes. Genotype 1a and 1b cause the majority of infections in the USA. Viral genomic sequence information is needed to correlate viral variation with pathology or response to therapy. However, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the HCV genome must overcome low template concentration and high target sequence diversity. Amplification conditions must hence have both high sensitivity and specificity yet recognize a heterogeneous target population to permit general amplification with minimal bias. This places divergent demands of the amplification conditions that can be very difficult to reconcile. RT and nested PCR conditions were optimized independently and systematically for amplifying the complete open reading frame (ORF) from HCV genotype 1a and 1b using several overlapping amplicons. For each ampli...",

It is generally assumed that multiple sequence alignment yields better results than pair wise sequence alignment, but this assumption has rarely been tested, and never with the control provided by simulation analysis. This study used sequence simulation to examine the gain in accuracy of adding a third sequence to a pair wise alignment, particularly concentrating on how the phylogenetic position of the additional sequence relative to the first pair changes the accuracy of the initial pair's alignment as well as their estimated evolutionary distance. The maximal gain in alignment accuracy was found not when the third sequence is directly intermediate between the initial two sequences, but rather when it perfectly subdivides the branch leading from the root of the tree to one of the original sequences (making it half as close to one sequence as the other). Evolutionary distance estimation in the multiple alig...",

The method for PEth analysis includes lipid extraction of whole blood, a one-hour HPLC separation of lipids and ELSD (evaporative light scattering) detection of PEth. Methodological improvements are presented which comprise a simpler extraction procedure, the use of phosphatidylbutanol as internal standard and a new algorithm for evaluation of unknown samples.

            "Rupture of a renal artery aneurysm (RAA) during pregnancy is a rare event, with a high mortality rate for both mother and fetus. Increased blood flow and intra-abdominal pressure, and vascular changes secondary to increased steroid production are postulated as contributory to the increased risk of rupture during pregnancy. We present here a case report of total avulsion of solitary kidney secondary to rupture of RAA in a pregnant patient with congenital absence of the contralateral kidney. The main indication for nephrectomy was severely damaged kidney. Diagnosis was made during operation and both mother and fetus were saved. There are no previous reports of an intact renal artery aneurysm diagnosed either antepartum or postpartum. The possibility of a ruptured RAA should be considered in pregnant women with evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. This case was unusual because it occurred in a solitary kidney, during the third trimester of pregnancy.",

All controls volunteered for this study, had never smoked, and did not have respiratory illness. IS was processed by conventional methods. Retrieved cells were differentially counted, and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), particle size distribution (PSD), and mineral composition were measured. Differential cell counts of FDNY-FF IS differed from those of health care worker controls...",
            "Recent studies have implicated the dying cell as a potential reservoir of modified autoantigens that might initiate and drive systemic autoimmunity in susceptible hosts. A number of subunits of the exosome, a complex of 3'\u21925' exoribonucleases that functions in a variety of cellular processes, are recognized by the so-called anti-PM/Scl autoantibodies, found predominantly in patients suffering from an overlap syndrome of myositis and scleroderma. Here we show that one of these subunits, PM/Scl-75, is cleaved during apoptosis. PM/Scl-75 cleavage is inhibited by several different caspase inhibitors. The analysis of PM/Scl-75 cleavage by recombinant caspase proteins shows that PM/Scl-75 is efficiently cleaved by caspase-1, to a smaller extent by caspase-8, and relatively inefficiently by caspase-3 and caspase-7. Cleavage of the PM/Scl-75 protein occurs in the C-terminal part of the protein at Asp369 (IILD"

            "Knowledge about the mechanism that establishes embryonic polarity is fundamental in understanding mammalian development. In re-addressing several controversial claims, we recently proposed a model in which mouse embryonic polarity is not specified until the blastocyst stage. Before fertilization, the fully differentiated oocyte has been characterized as \u201cpolarized,\u201d and we indeed observed that the sperm preferentially enters the polar body half. Here we show that preferential sperm entry is not due to an intrinsic polarity of the oocyte, since fertilization takes place uniformly when the zona pellucida is removed. We suggest that the term \u201casymmetry\u201d denotes morphological differences, whereas \u201cpolarity\u201d in addition implies developmental consequences. Thus, the mouse oocyte can be considered \u201casymmetric\u201d but \u201cnon-polarized.\u201d The penetration through the zona pellucida is also random, and a significant proportion of sperm binds to the oocyte membrane at a point distant from the zona penet...",

            "Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES)-based bicistronic vectors are important tools in today's cell biology. Among applications, the expression of two proteins under the control of a unique promoter permits the monitoring of expression of a protein whose biological function is being investigated through the observation of an easily detectable tracer, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). However, analysis of published results making use of bicistronic vectors indicates that the efficiency of the IRES-controlled expression can vary widely from one vector to another, despite their apparent identical IRES sequences. We investigated the molecular basis for these discrepancies. We observed up to a 10 fold difference in IRES-controlled expression from distinct bicistronic expression vectors harboring the same apparent IRES sequences. We show that the insertion of a HindIII site, in place of the initiating AUG codon of the wild type EMCV IRES, is responsible for the dramatic loss of expressi...",

Senescence phenotype can be induced by (1) telomere attrition-induced senescence at the end of the cellular mitotic life span (MLS*) and (2) also by replication history-independent, accelerated senescence due to inadvertent activation of oncogenes or by exposure of cells to genotoxins. Tumor suppressor genes p53/pRB/p16INK4A and related senescence checkpoints are involved in effecting the onset of senescence. However, senescence as a tumor suppressor mechanism is a leaky process and senescent cells with mutations or epimutations in these genes escape mitotic catastrophe-induced cell death by becoming polyploid cells. These polyploid giant cells, before they die, give rise to several cells with viable genomes via nuclear budding and asymmetric cytokinesis. This mode...",
            "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a pathogenic hepatic flavivirus with a single stranded RNA genome. It has a high genetic variability and is classified into six major genotypes. Genotype 1a and 1b cause the majority of infections in the USA. Viral genomic sequence information is needed to correlate viral variation with pathology or response to therapy. However, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the HCV genome must overcome low template concentration and high target sequence diversity. Amplification conditions must hence have both high sensitivity and specificity yet recognize a heterogeneous target population to permit general amplification with minimal bias. This places divergent demands of the amplification conditions that can be very difficult to reconcile.

The maximal gain in alignment accuracy was found not when the third sequence is directly intermediate between the initial two sequences, but rather when it perfectly subdivides the branch leading from the root of the tree to one of the original sequences (making it half as close to one sequence as the other).

            "SNAP-25 is a synaptic protein known to be involved in exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in neurons and of large dense-core vesicles in neuroendocrine cells. Its role in exocytosis has been studied in SNAP-25 knockout mice, in lysed synaptosomes lacking functional SNAP-25 and in cells after treatment with botulinum toxins A or E that specifically cleave SNAP-25. These studies have shown that SNAP-25 appears to be required for most but not all evoked secretion. In order to further study the role of SNAP-25 in catecholamine secretion from PC12 cells we have used the recently developed technique of RNA interference to generate PC12 cell lines with virtually undetectable levels of SNAP-25. RNA interference is the sequence-specific silencing or knockdown of gene expression triggered by the introduction of double-stranded RNA into a cell. RNA interference can be elicited in mammalian cells in a number of ways, one of which is by the expression of small hairpin RNAs from a transfected plasmid. S...",

            "Anticholinergics are widely used for the treatment of COPD, and to a lesser extent for asthma. Primarily used as bronchodilators, they reverse the action of vagally derived acetylcholine on airway smooth muscle contraction. Recent novel studies suggest that the effects of anticholinergics likely extend far beyond inducing bronchodilation, as the novel anticholinergic drug tiotropium bromide can effectively inhibit accelerated decline of lung function in COPD patients. Vagal tone is increased in airway inflammation associated with asthma and COPD; this results from exaggerated acetylcholine release and enhanced expression of downstream signaling components in airway smooth muscle. Vagally derived acetylcholine also regulates mucus production in the airways. A number of recent research papers also indicate that acetylcholine, acting through muscarinic receptors, may in part regulate pathological changes associated with airway remodeling. Muscarinic receptor signalling regulates airway sm...",
            "The cladistic approach proposed by Templeton has been presented as promising for the study of the genetic factors involved in common diseases. This approach allows the joint study of multiple markers within a gene by considering haplotypes and grouping them in nested clades. The idea is to search for clades with an excess of cases as compared to the whole sample and to identify the mutations defining these clades as potential candidate disease susceptibility sites. However, the performance of this approach for the study of the genetic factors involved in complex diseases has never been studied. In this paper, we propose a new method to perform such a cladistic analysis and we estimate its power through simulations. We show that under models where the susceptibility to the disease is caused by a single genetic variant, the cladistic test is neither really more powerful to detect an association nor really more efficient to localize the susceptibility site than an individual SNP testing. ...",

Mammalian glycolipid transfer proteins (GLTPs) are potential regulators of cell processes mediated by GSLs and display a unique architecture among lipid binding/transfer proteins. The GLTP fold represents a novel membrane targeting/interaction domain among peripheral proteins. Here we report crystal structures of human GLTP bound to GSLs of diverse acyl chain length, unsaturation, and sugar composition. Structural comparisons show a highly conserved anchoring of galactosyl- and lactosyl-amide headgroups by the GLTP recognition center. By contrast, acyl chain chemical structure and occupancy of the hydrophobic tunnel dictate partitioning between sphingosine-in and newly-observed sphingosine-out ligand-binding modes.

The present analysis concerns the local recurrence rates for the 122 lumpectomy patients who did not receive breast irradiation. The cumulative rate of local breast recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.02. Similarly, in the lumpectomy patients, the cumulative rate of distant recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.04. In conclusion, our results suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy impacts on local breast recurrence in a similar manner to other sites in Stage II breast cancer patients treated by lumpectomy without radiation. Despite the use of a conventional 36-week adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, the local breast recurrence rate was substantial.",

Cell lines MTLn3 (high metastatic potential), MTF7 and MTLn2 (intermediate metastatic potential) and MTC (low metastatic potential) were subjected to a series of in vivo assays designed to assess how manipulation of the immune system in the syngeneic F344 host would affect the ability of these cells to metastasise. Treatment of tumour bearing rats with the immunosuppressive agents cyclosporin A or cyclophosphamide had little influence on metastasis in this system. Growth of tumours in congenitally athymic nude rats resulted in reduction of observed metastases. In addition, humoral immune response was not detectable during a 23-day period of tumour growth in F344 rats. Excision of the tumour growing in situ reduced the number of metastases when the tumours were resected early (less than 10 days), but at later times tumour resection did not influ...",

            "A detailed study was performed in 14 patients with epithelial ovarian tumours using the satellite probes 33.15, 228S and 216S to investigate the nature of somatic changes and frequency with which clonal changes could be demonstrated during metastasis and progression. Somatic changes were evident in approximately 70% of ovarian tumours, the most common being a deletion or reduction in intensity of a band suggesting loss of heterozygosity. Additional changes that were observed included increased intensification of single bands and the appearance of novel DNA fragments. Somatic alterations were seen following digestion of DNA with methylation resistant restriction endonucleases indicating that methylation differences alone could not account for all of the somatic changes. Using DNA fingerprint analysis ovarian tumours were shown to be heterogeneous with different DNA patterns observed in different sites in five of eight patients. Generally, within an individual patient the primary and met...",
            "This paper demonstrates experimentally how quantitative phase information can be obtained in scanning holographic microscopy. Scanning holography can operate in both coherent and incoherent modes, simultaneously if desired, with different detector geometries. A spatially integrating detector provides an incoherent hologram of the object's intensity distribution (absorption and/or fluorescence, for example), while a point detector in a conjugate plane of the pupil provides a coherent hologram of the object's complex amplitude, from which a quantitative measure of its phase distribution can be extracted. The possibility of capturing simultaneously holograms of three-dimensional specimens, leading to three-dimensional reconstructions with absorption contrast, reflectance contrast, fluorescence contrast, as was previously demonstrated, and quantitative phase contrast, as shown here for the first time, opens up new avenues for multimodal imaging in biological studies.",
            "In this study, we have investigated the expression of the proto-oncogene c-erbB2 in a total of 70 human primary breast tumours. In agreement with other workers, we observed c-erbB2 gene amplification in 17.5% of the tumours studied. In addition, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of c-erbB2 mRNA expression in the tumours using RNase mapping and in situ hybridisation techniques. Our results indicated a more frequent (30%) overexpression of c-erbB2 mRNA, which was associated only with breast carcinomas of a ductal origin. Furthermore, analysis of the c-erbB2 mRNA gene locus in the same tumours demonstrated that enhanced c-erbB2 expression could occur in the presence or absence of gene amplification, suggesting that additional molecular mechanisms may result in overexpression of c-erbB2 mRNA in human mammary tumours. In situ hybridisation showed that elevated levels of c-erbB2 mRNA were specific to malignant cells within the breast tumour. Analysis of the association between c-erbB2 ...",

            "Calcyon is a single transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in the brain. Very recently, calcyon has been implicated in clathrin mediated endocytosis, a critical component of synaptic plasticity. At the genetic level, preliminary evidence supports an association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and polymorphisms in the calcyon gene. As little is known about the potential role of calcyon in ADHD, animal models may provide important insights into this issue. We examined calcyon mRNA expression in the frontal-striatal circuitry of three-, five-, and ten-week-old Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR), the most commonly used animal model of ADHD, and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY; the strain from which SHR were derived). As a complement, we performed a co-expression network analysis using a database of mRNA gene expression profiles of multiple brain regions in order to explore potential functional links of calcyon to other genes.

With the exception of 3 leukaemias all were strongly beta 2 microglobulin+. No correlation was found between the % DR+ cells and the level of lymphocyte stimulation. Separation of leukaemia cells on Ficoll gradients into fractions containing different proportions of DR+ cells did not correlate with LAD expression. Furthermore, antisera to DR antigens only partially blocked leukaemic LAD. The results support the notion that LAD on acute leukaemias are not necessarily associated with or identical to HLA-DR antigens, and that the lymphocyte activating capacity of HLA-DR may be modulated.",

In agreement with this, tumour hypoxia was found to be significantly increased: Microelectrode PO2 measurements showed a clear relationship between CO concentration and the proportion of low PO2 measurements (< or = 5 mmHg). The fraction of clonogenic hypoxic cells increased from 8% in air-breathing animals to 13%, 18% and 54% with 75,220 and 660 p.p.m. CO respectively. The tumour hypoxia resulted in significant radiation modification. The local tumour control after single-dose and fractionated irradiation gave TCD50 enhancement ratios (rel...",

Most genome browsers use only simple keyword searches and limit the display of detailed annotations to one chromosomal region of the genome at a time. We have employed concepts, methodologies, and tools that were developed for the display of geographic data to develop a Genome Spatial Information System (GenoSIS) for displaying genomes spatially, and interacting with genome annotations and related attribute data. In contrast to the paradigm of horizontally stacked data tracks used by most genome browsers, GenoSIS uses the concept of registered spatial layers composed of spatial objects for integrated display of diverse data. In addition to basic keyword searches, GenoSIS supports complex queries, including spatial queries, and dynamically generates genome maps. Our adaptation of the geographic information system (...",

This problem is obviated in family-based studies, but it is usually difficult to accumulate large enough samples of well-characterized families. We addressed empirically whether the two designs give similar estimates of association in 93 investigations where both unrelated case-control and family-based designs had been employed. Estimated odds ratios differed beyond chance between the two designs in only four instances (4%). The summary relative odds ratio (ROR) (the ratio of odds ratios obtained from unrelated case-control and family-based studies) was close to unity (0.96 [95% confidence interval, 0.91\u20131.01]). There was no heterogeneity in the ROR across studies (amount of heterogeneity beyond chance I p",

            "Recent studies have implicated the dying cell as a potential reservoir of modified autoantigens that might initiate and drive systemic autoimmunity in susceptible hosts. A number of subunits of the exosome, a complex of 3'\u21925' exoribonucleases that functions in a variety of cellular processes, are recognized by the so-called anti-PM/Scl autoantibodies, found predominantly in patients suffering from an overlap syndrome of myositis and scleroderma. Here we show that one of these subunits, PM/Scl-75, is cleaved during apoptosis. PM/Scl-75 cleavage is inhibited by several different caspase inhibitors. The analysis of PM/Scl-75 cleavage by recombinant caspase proteins shows that PM/Scl-75 is efficiently cleaved by caspase-1, to a smaller extent by caspase-8, and relatively inefficiently by caspase-3 and caspase-7. Cleavage of the PM/Scl-75 protein occurs in the C-terminal part of the protein at Asp369 (IILD",
            "A pandemic H5N1 influenza outbreak would be facilitated by an absence of immunity to the avian-derived virus in the human population. Although this condition is likely in regard to hemagglutinin-mediated immunity, the neuraminidase (NA) of H5N1 viruses (avN1) and of endemic human H1N1 viruses (huN1) are classified in the same serotype. We hypothesized that an immune response to huN1 could mediate cross-protection against H5N1 influenza virus infection. Mice were immunized against the NA of a contemporary human H1N1 strain by DNA vaccination. They were challenged with recombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) viruses bearing huN1 (PR8-huN1) or avN1 (PR8-avN1) or with H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1203/04. Additional na\u00efve mice were injected with sera from vaccinated mice prior to H5N1 challenge. Also, serum specimens from humans were analyzed for reactivity with avN1.

            "Following EMS mutagenesis, three estramustine (EM) resistant DU 145 human prostatic carcinoma cell lines were clonally selected by exposure to incrementally increasing concentrations of the drug. Although only low levels of resistance (approximately 3-fold) were attainable, this resistance was stable in the absence of continuous drug exposure. These EM-resistant clones (EMR 4,9,12) did not exhibit cross resistance to vinblastine, taxol, or adriamycin, and had collateral sensitivity to cytochalasin B. None of the lines had elevated expression of P-glycoprotein mRNA or glutathione S-transferase activity, suggesting a phenotype distinct from the classic multi-drug resistance phenotype. This conclusion was supported further by the observation that two MDR cell lines (FLC mouse erythroleukaemic and SKOV3 human ovarian carcinoma cells) showed sensitivity to EM. Fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis of the effects of EM on cell cycle traverse revealed that at EM concentrations up to 20 ...",

This study focuses on the importance of social background factors and previous low back pain in the development of low back pain in military recruits. During a three-month period, Danish military recruits with different social backgrounds live and work under the same conditions. Thus, there is an opportunity to investigate the influence of social background on the development of low back pain, when persons are removed from their usual environment and submitted to a number of new stressors. In addition, the importance of the recruits' previous low back pain history in relation to low back pain during military service was studied.

            "Gene Ontology (GO) terms are often used to assess the results of microarray experiments. The most common way to do this is to perform Fisher's exact tests to find GO terms which are over-represented amongst the genes declared to be differentially expressed in the analysis of the microarray experiment. However, due to the high degree of dependence between GO terms, statistical testing is conservative, and interpretation is difficult. We propose testing groups of GO terms rather than individual terms, to increase statistical power, reduce dependence between tests and improve the interpretation of results. We use the publicly available package POSOC to group the terms. Our method finds groups of GO terms significantly over-represented amongst differentially expressed genes which are not found by Fisher's tests on individual GO terms. Grouping Gene Ontology terms improves the interpretation of gene set enrichment for microarray data.",

However, there was no overall difference in the total number of matings acquired by males from different treatments (p = 0.08). The survival of males from the low crowding treatment was lower than those from other treatments. The body size and teneral reserves of adult males did not differ between crowding treatments, but larger males were more likely to acquire mates than small individuals.

PEth in blood is a promising new marker of ethanol abuse depending on the high specificity and sensitivity of this marker. None of the biological markers used in clinical routine at the present time are sensitive and specific enough for the diagnosis of alcohol abuse. The method for PEth analysis includes lipid extraction of whole blood, a one-hour HPLC separation of lipids and ELSD (evaporative light scattering) detection of PEth. Methodological improvements are presented which comprise a simpler extraction procedure, the use of phosphatidylbutanol as internal standard and a new algorithm for evaluation of unknown samples.

Recently, it has been reported in the literature that the FDR is not well controlled by SAM. Due to the vast application of SAM in microarray data analysis, it is of great importance to have an extensive evaluation of SAM and its associated R-package (sam2.20). Our study has identified several discrepancies between SAM and sam2.20. One major difference is that SAM and sam2.20 use different methods for estimating FDR. Such discrepancies may cause confusion among the researchers who are using SAM or are developing the SAM-like methods. We have also shown that SAM provides no meaningful estimates of FDR and this problem has been corrected in sam2.20 by using a different formula for estimating FDR. However, we have found that, even with the improvement sam2.20 has made over SAM, sam2.20 may still produce erroneous and even conflictin...",

            "Olfactory receptors (ORs) are the largest gene family in the human genome. Although they are expected to be expressed specifically in olfactory tissues, some ectopic expression has been reported, with special emphasis on sperm and testis. The present study systematically explores the expression patterns of OR genes in a large number of tissues and assesses the potential functional implication of such ectopic expression. We analyzed the expression of hundreds of human and mouse OR transcripts, via EST and microarray data, in several dozens of human and mouse tissues. Different tissues had specific, relatively small OR gene subsets which had particularly high expression levels. In testis, average expression was not particularly high, and very few highly expressed genes were found, none corresponding to ORs previously implicated in sperm chemotaxis. Higher expression levels were more common for genes with a non-OR genomic neighbor. Importantly, no correlation in expression levels was dete...",

Considering that CD40 may be activated also by the soluble isoform of CD40L (sCD40L), we investigated the serum levels of sCD40L in a series of 61 UNPC patients from Italy, a non-endemic area for this disease. At diagnosis, serum samples of UNPC patients contained significantly higher levels of sCD40L than age-matched healthy controls (p < 0.001). High levels of sCD40L (i.e., >18 ng/ml) were more frequently found in patients <40 years of age (p = 0.03) and with distant metastases at presentation (p = 0.03). Serum levels of sCD40L were inversely associated with the expression of the EBV oncoprotein LMP-1 (p = 0.03), which mimics a constitutively activated CD40.

            "In their commentary on my paper Phillips and Goodman suggested that counterfactual causality and considerations on causality like those by Bradford Hill are only \"guideposts on the road to common sense\". I argue that if common sense is understood to mean views that the vast majority of researchers share, Hill's considerations did not lead to common sense in the past \u2013 precisely because they are so controversial. If common sense is taken to mean beliefs that are true, then Hill's considerations can only lead to common sense in the simple and well-understood causal systems they apply to. Counterfactuals, however, are largely common sense in the latter meaning. I suggest that the road of scientific endeavour should lead epidemiologic research toward sound strategies that equip researchers with skills to separate causal from non-causal associations with minimal error probabilities. This is undeniably the right direction and the one counterfactual causality leads to. Hill's considerations a...",
            "Infectious bronchitis is highly contagious and constitutes one of the most common and difficult poultry diseases to control. IBV is endemic in probably all countries that raise chickens. It exists as dozens of serotypes/genotypes. Only a few amino acid differences in the S1 protein of vaccine and challenge strains of IBV may result in poor protection. Tropism of IBV includes the respiratory tract tissues, proventriculus and caecal tonsils of the alimentary tract, the oviduct and the kidney. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain closely related to Massachusetts (Mass) serotype was isolated from broiler chickens suffering from severe renal and respiratory distresses. The isolate was serologically identified by Dot-ELISA and further characterized by RT-PCR then genotyped using S1 gene sequence analysis. Alignment of the S1 sequence of the isolate with 16 IBV strains revealed high homology to isolates related to Mass serotype. Inoculation with the strain reproduced the disease in experi...",

Personality styles were measured by the Sociotropy and Autonomy Scale (SAS) and the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS). The Structured Clinical interview for DSM Axis I was applied to Axis I disorders, while the Beck Depression Inventory was used to measure depression severity. Patients with FMS in general have a sociotropic personality style similar to patients with MDD, and different from HC, but FMS patients without a lifetime history of MDD had a cognitive personality style different from patients with MDD and similar to HC. These findings suggest that a depressotypic personality style is related to depressive disorder, but not to FMS.",

Here we show that one of these subunits, PM/Scl-75, is cleaved during apoptosis. PM/Scl-75 cleavage is inhibited by several different caspase inhibitors. The analysis of PM/Scl-75 cleavage by recombinant caspase proteins shows that PM/Scl-75 is efficiently cleaved by caspase-1, to a smaller extent by caspase-8, and relatively inefficiently by caspase-3 and caspase-7. Cleavage of the PM/Scl-75 protein occurs in the C-terminal part of the protein at Asp369 (IILD",

Mass spectrometry combined with pulsed incorporation of stable isotopes of arginine and lysine was used to perform a quantitative and unbiased global analysis of the rates at which newly synthesized, endogenous proteins appear within mammalian nucleoli. Newly synthesized ribosomal proteins accumulated in nucleoli more quickly than other nucleolar components. Studies involving time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of stable HeLa cell lines expressing fluorescent-protein-tagged nucleolar factors also showed that ribosomal proteins accumulate more quickly than other components.

The present analysis concerns the local recurrence rates for the 122 lumpectomy patients who did not receive breast irradiation. The cumulative rate of local breast recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.02. Similarly, in the lumpectomy patients, the cumulative rate of distant recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.04.

            "Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES)-based bicistronic vectors are important tools in today's cell biology. Among applications, the expression of two proteins under the control of a unique promoter permits the monitoring of expression of a protein whose biological function is being investigated through the observation of an easily detectable tracer, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). However, analysis of published results making use of bicistronic vectors indicates that the efficiency of the IRES-controlled expression can vary widely from one vector to another, despite their apparent identical IRES sequences. We investigated the molecular basis for these discrepancies. We observed up to a 10 fold difference in IRES-controlled expression from distinct bicistronic expression vectors harboring the same apparent IRES sequences. We show that the insertion of a HindIII site, in place of the initiating AUG codon of the wild type EMCV IRES, is responsible for the dramatic loss of expressi...",
            "Knowledge about the mechanism that establishes embryonic polarity is fundamental in understanding mammalian development. In re-addressing several controversial claims, we recently proposed a model in which mouse embryonic polarity is not specified until the blastocyst stage. Before fertilization, the fully differentiated oocyte has been characterized as \u201cpolarized,\u201d and we indeed observed that the sperm preferentially enters the polar body half. Here we show that preferential sperm entry is not due to an intrinsic polarity of the oocyte, since fertilization takes place uniformly when the zona pellucida is removed. We suggest that the term \u201casymmetry\u201d denotes morphological differences, whereas \u201cpolarity\u201d in addition implies developmental consequences. Thus, the mouse oocyte can be considered \u201casymmetric\u201d but \u201cnon-polarized.\u201d The penetration through the zona pellucida is also random, and a significant proportion of sperm binds to the oocyte membrane at a point distant from the zona penet...",

This approach allows the joint study of multiple markers within a gene by considering haplotypes and grouping them in nested clades. The idea is to search for clades with an excess of cases as compared to the whole sample and to identify the mutations defining these clades as potential candidate disease susceptibility sites. However, the performance of this approach for the study of the genetic factors involved in complex diseases has never been studied. In this paper, we propose a new method to perform such a cladistic analysis and we estimate its power through simulations.

Genotype 1a and 1b cause the majority of infections in the USA. Viral genomic sequence information is needed to correlate viral variation with pathology or response to therapy. However, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the HCV genome must overcome low template concentration and high target sequence diversity. Amplification conditions must hence have both high sensitivity and specificity yet recognize a heterogeneous target population to permit general amplification with minimal bias. This places divergent demands of the amplification conditions that can be very difficult to reconcile. RT and nested PCR conditions were optimized independently and systematically for amplifying the complete open reading frame (ORF) from HCV genotype 1a and 1b using several overlapping amplicons. For each ampli...",

Particle characteristics such as size, surface area and chemistry seem to influence the negative effects of particles. In this study, combustion particles from vehicle exhaust and wood smoke, currently used in biological experiments, were analysed with respect to microstructure and chemistry. Vehicle exhaust particles were collected in a road tunnel during two seasons, with and without use of studded tires, whereas wood smoke was collected from a stove with single-stage combustion. Additionally, a reference diesel sample (SRM 2975) was analysed. The samples were characterised using transmission electron microscopy techniques (TEM/HRTEM, EELS and SAED). Furthermore, the elemental and organic carbon fractions were quantified using thermal optical transmission analysis and the content of selected PAHs was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

            "SNAP-25 is a synaptic protein known to be involved in exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in neurons and of large dense-core vesicles in neuroendocrine cells. Its role in exocytosis has been studied in SNAP-25 knockout mice, in lysed synaptosomes lacking functional SNAP-25 and in cells after treatment with botulinum toxins A or E that specifically cleave SNAP-25. These studies have shown that SNAP-25 appears to be required for most but not all evoked secretion. In order to further study the role of SNAP-25 in catecholamine secretion from PC12 cells we have used the recently developed technique of RNA interference to generate PC12 cell lines with virtually undetectable levels of SNAP-25. RNA interference is the sequence-specific silencing or knockdown of gene expression triggered by the introduction of double-stranded RNA into a cell. RNA interference can be elicited in mammalian cells in a number of ways, one of which is by the expression of small hairpin RNAs from a transfected plasmid. S...",
            "Anticholinergics are widely used for the treatment of COPD, and to a lesser extent for asthma. Primarily used as bronchodilators, they reverse the action of vagally derived acetylcholine on airway smooth muscle contraction. Recent novel studies suggest that the effects of anticholinergics likely extend far beyond inducing bronchodilation, as the novel anticholinergic drug tiotropium bromide can effectively inhibit accelerated decline of lung function in COPD patients. Vagal tone is increased in airway inflammation associated with asthma and COPD; this results from exaggerated acetylcholine release and enhanced expression of downstream signaling components in airway smooth muscle. Vagally derived acetylcholine also regulates mucus production in the airways. A number of recent research papers also indicate that acetylcholine, acting through muscarinic receptors, may in part regulate pathological changes associated with airway remodeling. Muscarinic receptor signalling regulates airway sm...",

The purpose of this paper is to examine, the hospital activity resulting from such incidents including to length of stay, gender, age and cause. The data was extracted from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for episodes with a mention of ICD 10 (V90\u201394, W15\u201316, W65\u201374, X38, X92, Y21) for the years 1997/8 to 2003/4. Population based rates and relative risk were calculated using the most recent Census data for England (2001). The 6,793 episodes resulted in a total of 32,520 bed days with an average of length of stay of 5.0 days. Males made up 73.7% (n = 5,006) of episodes and females 26.1% (n = 1,787). Annual trends peaked in 1999\u20132000 at a rate of 2.4 per 100,000 and have fluctuated on alternate years there after.

            "We describe the basic tenets of the current concepts of cancer biology, and review the recent advances on the suppressor role of senescence in tumor growth and the breakdown of this barrier during the origin of tumor growth. Senescence phenotype can be induced by (1) telomere attrition-induced senescence at the end of the cellular mitotic life span (MLS*) and (2) also by replication history-independent, accelerated senescence due to inadvertent activation of oncogenes or by exposure of cells to genotoxins. Tumor suppressor genes p53/pRB/p16INK4A and related senescence checkpoints are involved in effecting the onset of senescence. However, senescence as a tumor suppressor mechanism is a leaky process and senescent cells with mutations or epimutations in these genes escape mitotic catastrophe-induced cell death by becoming polyploid cells. These polyploid giant cells, before they die, give rise to several cells with viable genomes via nuclear budding and asymmetric cytokinesis. This mode...",

            "In 1997 there was a major reform of the government run urban health insurance system in China. The principal aims of the reform were to widen coverage of health insurance for the urban employed and contain medical costs. Following this reform there has been a transition from the dual system of the Government Insurance Scheme (GIS) and Labour Insurance Scheme (LIS) to the new Urban Employee Basic Health Insurance Scheme (BHIS). This paper uses data from the National Health Services Surveys of 1998 and 2003 to examine the impact of the reform on population coverage. Particular attention is paid to coverage in terms of gender, age, employment status, and income levels. Following a description of the data between the two years, the paper will discuss the relationship between the insurance reform and the growing inequities in population coverage. An examination of the data reveals a number of key points: a) The overall coverage of the newly established scheme has decreased from 1998 to 2003...",

The present study aimed at examining the relationship between the expression of COX-2 and of MDR1/P-gp in a group of breast cancer cases. Immunohistochemical reactions were performed using monoclonal antibodies against COX-2 and MDR1/P-gp on samples originating from 104 cases of primary invasive breast cancer. COX-2-positive cases were shown to demonstrate higher expression of MDR1/P-gp (P < 0.0001). The studies also demonstrate that COX-2 expression was typical for cases of a higher grade (P = 0.01), a shorter overall survival time (P < 0.0001) and a shorter progression-free time (P < 0.0001).

Image processing of histology slide images was used to detect and identify adipose tissue, extracellular matrix, morphologically distinct cell nuclei types, and the tubular architecture. The texture parameters derived from image analysis were then applied to classify images in a supervised classification scheme using histologic grade of a testing set as guidance.

Renal failure is usually due to development of acute tubular necrosis as a result of intravascular haemolysis, rhabdomyolysis or shock. Rarely it can be following development of acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis. We describe a young male, who was stung on face, head, shoulders and upper limbs by multiple hornets (Vespa orientalis). He developed acute renal failure as a result of acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis and responded to steroids.

Such discrepancies may cause confusion among the researchers who are using SAM or are developing the SAM-like methods. We have also shown that SAM provides no meaningful estimates of FDR and this problem has been corrected in sam2.20 by using a different formula for estimating FDR.

            "Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) play major roles in cellular growth and development. Mammalian glycolipid transfer proteins (GLTPs) are potential regulators of cell processes mediated by GSLs and display a unique architecture among lipid binding/transfer proteins. The GLTP fold represents a novel membrane targeting/interaction domain among peripheral proteins. Here we report crystal structures of human GLTP bound to GSLs of diverse acyl chain length, unsaturation, and sugar composition. Structural comparisons show a highly conserved anchoring of galactosyl- and lactosyl-amide headgroups by the GLTP recognition center. By contrast, acyl chain chemical structure and occupancy of the hydrophobic tunnel dictate partitioning between sphingosine-in and newly-observed sphingosine-out ligand-binding modes. The structural insights, combined with computed interaction propensity distributions, suggest a concerted sequence of events mediated by GLTP conformational changes during GSL transfer to and/or f...",

In insects, it is a pulse of ecdysone at the end of larval life that causes the larva to stop feeding and growing and initiate metamorphosis. Body size is a quantitative trait, so it is important that the problem of control of body size be analyzed quantitatively. The processes that control the timing of ecdysone secretion in larvae of the moth  Manduca sexta  We develop a quantitative description of the empirical data on body size determination that accurately predicts body size for diverse genetic strains. We show that body size is fully determined by three fundamental parameters: the growth rate, the critical weight (which signals the initiation of juvenile hormone breakdown), and the interval between the critical weight and the secretion of ecdysone. All three parameters are easily measured and differ between genetic strains and environmental conditions. The mathematical...",

Research indicates that at least 5\u201313% of schizophrenic patients die by suicide, and it is likely that the higher end of range is the most accurate estimate. There is almost total agreement that the schizophrenic patient who is more likely to commit suicide is young, male, white and never married, with good premorbid function, post-psychotic depression and a history of substance abuse and suicide attempts. Hopelessness, social isolation, hospitalization, deteriorating health after a high level of premorbid functioning, recent loss or rejection, limited external support, and family stress or instability are risk factors for suicide in patients with schizophrenia.

            "Calcyon is a single transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in the brain. Very recently, calcyon has been implicated in clathrin mediated endocytosis, a critical component of synaptic plasticity. At the genetic level, preliminary evidence supports an association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and polymorphisms in the calcyon gene. As little is known about the potential role of calcyon in ADHD, animal models may provide important insights into this issue. We examined calcyon mRNA expression in the frontal-striatal circuitry of three-, five-, and ten-week-old Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR), the most commonly used animal model of ADHD, and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY; the strain from which SHR were derived). As a complement, we performed a co-expression network analysis using a database of mRNA gene expression profiles of multiple brain regions in order to explore potential functional links of calcyon to other genes.

At presentation NSE was the most frequently elevated marker, being raised in 81% of patients and significantly higher in extensive as opposed to limited disease, as were LDH and ChrA. The response rate to therapy was best correlated with presentation level of ChrA, being 79% for those whose levels were within twice the upper limit of normal and 51% above (P < 0.01).

            "In this study, we have investigated the expression of the proto-oncogene c-erbB2 in a total of 70 human primary breast tumours. In agreement with other workers, we observed c-erbB2 gene amplification in 17.5% of the tumours studied. In addition, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of c-erbB2 mRNA expression in the tumours using RNase mapping and in situ hybridisation techniques. Our results indicated a more frequent (30%) overexpression of c-erbB2 mRNA, which was associated only with breast carcinomas of a ductal origin. Furthermore, analysis of the c-erbB2 mRNA gene locus in the same tumours demonstrated that enhanced c-erbB2 expression could occur in the presence or absence of gene amplification, suggesting that additional molecular mechanisms may result in overexpression of c-erbB2 mRNA in human mammary tumours. In situ hybridisation showed that elevated levels of c-erbB2 mRNA were specific to malignant cells within the breast tumour. Analysis of the association between c-erbB2 ...",

Somatic changes were evident in approximately 70% of ovarian tumours, the most common being a deletion or reduction in intensity of a band suggesting loss of heterozygosity. Additional changes that were observed included increased intensification of single bands and the appearance of novel DNA fragments. Somatic alterations were seen following digestion of DNA with methylation resistant restriction endonucleases indicating that methylation differences alone could not account for all of the somatic changes. Using DNA fingerprint analysis ovarian tumours were shown to be heterogeneous with different DNA patterns observed in different sites in five of eight patients.

The close correlation between LAD and DR known to occur on normal lymphocytes was not found in leukaemias. Twenty-two LAD+ leukaemias included 2 DR- cases, whilst 2 LAD- leukaemias were DR+. With the exception of 3 leukaemias all were strongly beta 2 microglobulin+. No correlation was found between the % DR+ cells and the level of lymphocyte stimulation. Separation of leukaemia cells on Ficoll gradients into fractions containing different proportions of DR+ cells did not correlate with LAD expression. Furthermore, antisera to DR antigens only partially blocked leukaemic LAD. The results support the notion that LAD on acute leukaemias are not necessarily associated with or identical to HLA-DR antigens, and that the lymphocyte activating capacity of HLA-DR may be modulated.",

In general, any network construction method should not depict more conflict than is found in the data, and, when the data is fitted well by a tree, the method should return a network that is close to this tree.

We and other investigators have mutagenized rodent cells and isolated mutant cell lines resistant to retrovirus infection. Since there are differences in the efficiency of single round infection with VSVG pseudotyped HIV-1 on cells of different species, we conducted a genetic screen to isolate human cells resistant to HIV-1 infection. We chemically mutagenized human HeLa cells and validated our ability to isolate mutants at test diploid loci. We then executed a screen to isolate HeLa cell mutants resistant to infection by an HIV-1 vector coding for a toxic gene product. We isolated two mutant cell lines that exhibit up to 10-fold resistance to infection by HIV-1 vectors. We have verified that the cells are resistant to infection and not defective in gene expression.

            "The effect of acute carbon monoxide (CO) breathing on blood oxygenation and tumour hypoxia was related to the radiation response of the C3H/Tif mammary carcinoma. Blood gas analysis showed that CO breathing caused a time- and dose-dependent formation of carboxyhaemoglobin (HbCO), a significant left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve and a reduction in tumour blood perfusion. These factors all contributed to a marked drop in tumour oxygen supply. In agreement with this, tumour hypoxia was found to be significantly increased: Microelectrode PO2 measurements showed a clear relationship between CO concentration and the proportion of low PO2 measurements (< or = 5 mmHg). The fraction of clonogenic hypoxic cells increased from 8% in air-breathing animals to 13%, 18% and 54% with 75,220 and 660 p.p.m. CO respectively. The tumour hypoxia resulted in significant radiation modification. The local tumour control after single-dose and fractionated irradiation gave TCD50 enhancement ratios (rel...",
            "Following EMS mutagenesis, three estramustine (EM) resistant DU 145 human prostatic carcinoma cell lines were clonally selected by exposure to incrementally increasing concentrations of the drug. Although only low levels of resistance (approximately 3-fold) were attainable, this resistance was stable in the absence of continuous drug exposure. These EM-resistant clones (EMR 4,9,12) did not exhibit cross resistance to vinblastine, taxol, or adriamycin, and had collateral sensitivity to cytochalasin B. None of the lines had elevated expression of P-glycoprotein mRNA or glutathione S-transferase activity, suggesting a phenotype distinct from the classic multi-drug resistance phenotype. This conclusion was supported further by the observation that two MDR cell lines (FLC mouse erythroleukaemic and SKOV3 human ovarian carcinoma cells) showed sensitivity to EM. Fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis of the effects of EM on cell cycle traverse revealed that at EM concentrations up to 20 ..."

The most common way to do this is to perform Fisher's exact tests to find GO terms which are over-represented amongst the genes declared to be differentially expressed in the analysis of the microarray experiment. However, due to the high degree of dependence between GO terms, statistical testing is conservative, and interpretation is difficult. We propose testing groups of GO terms rather than individual terms, to increase statistical power, reduce dependence between tests and improve the interpretation of results. We use the publicly available package POSOC to group the terms. Our method finds groups of GO terms significantly over-represented amongst differentially expressed genes which are not found by Fisher's tests on individual GO terms.

Due to the vast application of SAM in microarray data analysis, it is of great importance to have an extensive evaluation of SAM and its associated R-package (sam2.20). Our study has identified several discrepancies between SAM and sam2.20. One major difference is that SAM and sam2.20 use different methods for estimating FDR. Such discrepancies may cause confusion among the researchers who are using SAM or are developing the SAM-like methods. We have also shown that SAM provides no meaningful estimates of FDR and this problem has been corrected in sam2.20 by using a different formula for estimating FDR. However, we have found that, even with the improvement sam2.20 has made over SAM, sam2.20 may still produce erroneous and even conflictin...",

Using immunohistochemical methods, the expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cathepsin D were compared in the two groups. A similar proportion of screened and unscreened tumours expressed c-erbB-2 oncoprotein and EGFR but expression of the oestrogen regulated protein cathepsin D was significantly more frequent in the screened group (P less than 0.05).

Analysis of these studies has been complicated by the large disparity in the magnitude of effects seen by different groups and obscured by the recently appreciated process of in vivo stem-cell fusion. We now show a novel population of nonsatellite cells in adult murine skeletal muscle that progress under standard primary cell-culture conditions to autonomously beating cardiomyocytes.

What protects centromeric cohesin from the prophase pathway? Potential candidates are proteins, known as shugoshins, that are homologous to  Drosophila",

The present analysis concerns the local recurrence rates for the 122 lumpectomy patients who did not receive breast irradiation. The cumulative rate of local breast recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.02. Similarly, in the lumpectomy patients, the cumulative rate of distant recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.04.

Tumor suppressor genes p53/pRB/p16INK4A and related senescence checkpoints are involved in effecting the onset of senescence. However, senescence as a tumor suppressor mechanism is a leaky process and senescent cells with mutations or epimutations in these genes escape mitotic catastrophe-induced cell death by becoming polyploid cells.

            "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a pathogenic hepatic flavivirus with a single stranded RNA genome. It has a high genetic variability and is classified into six major genotypes. Genotype 1a and 1b cause the majority of infections in the USA. Viral genomic sequence information is needed to correlate viral variation with pathology or response to therapy. However, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the HCV genome must overcome low template concentration and high target sequence diversity. Amplification conditions must hence have both high sensitivity and specificity yet recognize a heterogeneous target population to permit general amplification with minimal bias. This places divergent demands of the amplification conditions that can be very difficult to reconcile. RT and nested PCR conditions were optimized independently and systematically for amplifying the complete open reading frame (ORF) from HCV genotype 1a and 1b using several overlapping amplicons.

The maximal gain in alignment accuracy was found not when the third sequence is directly intermediate between the initial two sequences, but rather when it perfectly subdivides the branch leading from the root of the tree to one of the original sequences (making it half as close to one sequence as the other).

Somatic changes were evident in approximately 70% of ovarian tumours, the most common being a deletion or reduction in intensity of a band suggesting loss of heterozygosity. Additional changes that were observed included increased intensification of single bands and the appearance of novel DNA fragments. Somatic alterations were seen following digestion of DNA with methylation resistant restriction endonucleases indicating that methylation differences alone could not account for all of the somatic changes. Using DNA fingerprint analysis ovarian tumours were shown to be heterogeneous with different DNA patterns observed in different sites in five of eight patients.

            "This paper demonstrates experimentally how quantitative phase information can be obtained in scanning holographic microscopy. Scanning holography can operate in both coherent and incoherent modes, simultaneously if desired, with different detector geometries. A spatially integrating detector provides an incoherent hologram of the object's intensity distribution (absorption and/or fluorescence, for example), while a point detector in a conjugate plane of the pupil provides a coherent hologram of the object's complex amplitude, from which a quantitative measure of its phase distribution can be extracted. The possibility of capturing simultaneously holograms of three-dimensional specimens, leading to three-dimensional reconstructions with absorption contrast, reflectance contrast, fluorescence contrast, as was previously demonstrated, and quantitative phase contrast, as shown here for the first time, opens up new avenues for multimodal imaging in biological studies.",
            "In this study, we have investigated the expression of the proto-oncogene c-erbB2 in a total of 70 human primary breast tumours. In agreement with other workers, we observed c-erbB2 gene amplification in 17.5% of the tumours studied. In addition, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of c-erbB2 mRNA expression in the tumours using RNase mapping and in situ hybridisation techniques. Our results indicated a more frequent (30%) overexpression of c-erbB2 mRNA, which was associated only with breast carcinomas of a ductal origin. Furthermore, analysis of the c-erbB2 mRNA gene locus in the same tumours demonstrated that enhanced c-erbB2 expression could occur in the presence or absence of gene amplification, suggesting that additional molecular mechanisms may result in overexpression of c-erbB2 mRNA in human mammary tumours. In situ hybridisation showed that elevated levels of c-erbB2 mRNA were specific to malignant cells within the breast tumour. Analysis of the association between c-erbB2 ...",

Very recently, calcyon has been implicated in clathrin mediated endocytosis, a critical component of synaptic plasticity. At the genetic level, preliminary evidence supports an association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and polymorphisms in the calcyon gene. As little is known about the potential role of calcyon in ADHD, animal models may provide important insights into this issue. We examined calcyon mRNA expression in the frontal-striatal circuitry of three-, five-, and ten-week-old Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR), the most commonly used animal model of ADHD, and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY; the strain from which SHR were derived). As a complement, we performed a co-expression network analysis using a database of mRNA gene expression profiles of multiple brain regions in order to explore potential functional links of calcyon to other genes.

            "Cytosine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) has been used successfully to induce immune responses against viral and intracellular organisms in mammals. The main objective of this study was to test the effect of CpG-ODN on antigen presenting cells of young foals. Peripheral blood monocytes of foals (n = 7) were isolated in the first day of life and monthly thereafter up to 3 months of life. Adult horse (n = 7) monocytes were isolated and tested once for comparison. Isolated monocytes were stimulated with IL-4 and GM-CSF (to obtain dendritic cells, DC) or not stimulated (to obtain macrophages). Macrophages and DCs were stimulated for 14\u201316 hours with either CpG-ODN, LPS or not stimulated. The stimulated and non-stimulated cells were tested for cell surface markers (CD86 and MHC class II) using flow cytometry, mRNA expression of cytokines (IL-12, IFN\u03b1, IL-10) and TLR-9 using real time quantitative RT-PCR, and for the activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB p65 using a...",

            "The Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) is a popular method for detecting significantly expressed genes and controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Recently, it has been reported in the literature that the FDR is not well controlled by SAM. Due to the vast application of SAM in microarray data analysis, it is of great importance to have an extensive evaluation of SAM and its associated R-package (sam2.20). Our study has identified several discrepancies between SAM and sam2.20. One major difference is that SAM and sam2.20 use different methods for estimating FDR. Such discrepancies may cause confusion among the researchers who are using SAM or are developing the SAM-like methods. We have also shown that SAM provides no meaningful estimates of FDR and this problem has been corrected in sam2.20 by using a different formula for estimating FDR. However, we have found that, even with the improvement sam2.20 has made over SAM, sam2.20 may still produce erroneous and even conflictin..."
