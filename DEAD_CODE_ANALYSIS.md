---

## 1. DEFINITELY UNUSED - SAFE TO DELETE (~3,989 lines)

### 1.1 Visualization Module (1,714 lines) - ZERO USAGE
**All imports are only from test files**

- `iris_rag/visualization/graph_visualizer.py` (486 lines)
  - Only imported by: `tests/test_graph_visualization.py`
  - Status: Test file exists but module has 0% coverage

- `iris_rag/visualization/graph_visualizer_extended.py` (525 lines)
  - Imports: 0 (completely unused)
  - Status: Dead code

- `iris_rag/visualization/iris_global_graphrag_interface.py` (278 lines)
  - Only imported by: `tests/test_graph_visualization.py`
  - Status: Test file exists but module has 0% coverage

- `iris_rag/visualization/multi_pipeline_comparator.py` (425 lines)
  - Only imported by: `tests/integration/test_multi_pipeline_comparison_integration.py`
  - Status: Test file exists but module has 0% coverage

**Recommendation**: DELETE ENTIRE `iris_rag/visualization/` DIRECTORY
- The visualization code was created but never integrated into actual workflows
- Tests exist but don't actually test functionality (0% coverage)
- No production code uses these visualizations

### 1.2 Testing Module (1,275 lines) - ZERO NON-TEST USAGE
**Only imported by contract tests that use pytest.raises(NotImplementedError)**

- `iris_rag/testing/coverage_analysis.py` (323 lines)
  - Imported by: 5 test files, all with commented-out imports or NotImplementedError
  - Status: Placeholder for unimplemented feature

- `iris_rag/testing/coverage_reporter.py` (412 lines)
  - Imported by: 3 test files, all with commented-out imports or NotImplementedError
  - Status: Placeholder for unimplemented feature

- `iris_rag/testing/coverage_validator.py` (375 lines)
  - Imported by: 2 test files, all with commented-out imports or NotImplementedError
  - Status: Placeholder for unimplemented feature

- `iris_rag/testing/example_usage.py` (165 lines)
  - Imports: 0 (completely unused)
  - Status: Example code never used

**Recommendation**: DELETE ENTIRE `iris_rag/testing/` DIRECTORY
- These were TDD placeholders for a coverage API that was never implemented
- Contract tests intentionally raise NotImplementedError
- All actual imports are commented out in test files

### 1.3 Common Unused Modules (1,000 lines)

- `common/iris_port_discovery.py` (189 lines)
  - Imports: 0 (completely unused)
  - Status: Utility created but never integrated
  - **DELETE**

- `common/llm_cache_iris.py` (560 lines)
  - Only imported by: `common/llm_cache_manager.py`
  - Status: Part of unused cache system
  - **DELETE**

- `common/llm_cache_config.py` (255 lines)
  - Imported by: llm_cache_iris, llm_cache_manager (unused chain)
  - Status: Part of unused cache system
  - **DELETE**

- `common/llm_cache_manager.py` (758 lines) - REVIEW
  - Imported by: `common/utils.py` but the import path is never actually used
  - Status: Part of unused cache system
  - **Likely DELETE** (verify utils.py doesn't use it)

**Conservative Total**: ~1,000 lines are definitely safe to delete.

### 1.4 Pipeline Factory/Registry (241 lines) - USED BY UNUSED HANDLERS

- `iris_rag/pipelines/factory.py` (161 lines, 0% coverage)
  - **Used by**:
    - `evaluation_framework/make_evaluation_handler.py`
    - `evaluation_framework/simple_make_handler.py`
    - `scripts/ci/run-benchmarks.py`
  - Status: Used by 3 files, but evaluation handlers are never called
  - **DELETE** (after verifying run-benchmarks.py)

- `iris_rag/pipelines/registry.py` (80 lines, 0% coverage)
  - **Used by**:
    - `evaluation_framework/make_evaluation_handler.py`
    - `evaluation_framework/simple_make_handler.py`
  - Status: Used by 2 files that are never called
  - **DELETE**

### 1.5 Evaluation Framework Handlers (562 lines) - NEVER CALLED

Files in `evaluation_framework/` that are never called by Makefile or any other code:
- `make_evaluation_handler.py` (~200 lines estimated)
- `simple_make_handler.py` (~200 lines estimated)
- `test_pipeline_integration.py` (~162 lines estimated)

**Recommendation**: DELETE these files along with factory.py and registry.py

### 1.6 Contract Tests (197 lines) - TESTS FOR UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURES

- `tests/contract/test_coverage_validate.py`
- `tests/contract/test_coverage_analyze.py`
- `tests/contract/test_coverage_reports.py`
- `tests/contract/test_coverage_trends.py`
- `tests/contract/test_coverage_modules.py`

All these tests intentionally raise `NotImplementedError` because the coverage API was never built.

**Recommendation**: DELETE `tests/contract/` directory

---

## 2. POSSIBLY UNUSED - NEEDS REVIEW (~1,213 lines)

### 2.1 GraphRAG Merged (972 lines) - USED BY OLD SCRIPTS

- `iris_rag/pipelines/graphrag_merged.py` (972 lines, 0% coverage)
  - **Used by** 4 non-test scripts:
    - `scripts/demo_ontology_support.py`
    - `scripts/optimize_graphrag_performance.py`
    - `scripts/benchmark_graphrag_optimizations.py`
    - `scripts/demo_graph_visualization.py`
  - **Also used by** 6 test files:
    - `tests/test_enterprise_10k_comprehensive.py`
    - `tests/test_graph_visualization.py`
    - Several merged graphrag test scripts
  - Status: Old GraphRAG implementation, likely superseded by newer versions
  - Last commit: Recent (2d8fca40b)

**Questions to Answer**:
1. Are these 8 scripts still valuable or are they obsolete demonstrations?
2. Has `graphrag_merged.py` been superseded by `graphrag.py` or `hybrid_graphrag.py`?
3. Should the scripts be migrated to use newer GraphRAG implementations?

**Recommendation**: **REVIEW with project owner** - If scripts are obsolete, DELETE all (972 lines). If valuable, migrate to newer GraphRAG and then delete.

### 2.2 Evaluation Framework (241 lines counted above)

Same as section 1.5 - needs review of `scripts/ci/run-benchmarks.py` to confirm it doesn't need PipelineFactory.

---

## 3. USED BUT UNTESTED - KEEP, ADD TESTS (~2,203 lines)

### 3.1 Memory Module (1,641 lines) - EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE

- `iris_rag/memory/knowledge_extractor.py` (466 lines)
  - **Used by**: `iris_rag/memory/rag_integration.py`
  - Status: Part of internal memory system

- `iris_rag/memory/models.py` (274 lines)
  - **Used by**: 4 other iris_rag modules (rag_integration, temporal_manager, knowledge_extractor, pylate_pipeline)
  - Status: Core data models for memory system

- `iris_rag/memory/rag_integration.py` (362 lines)
  - **Used by**: None (but uses knowledge_extractor and temporal_manager)
  - Status: Integration layer, likely intended for use but not yet integrated

- `iris_rag/memory/temporal_manager.py` (539 lines)
  - **Used by**: `iris_rag/memory/rag_integration.py`
  - Status: Temporal memory management
  - **Has tests**: `tests/test_temporal_manager.py` exists but module still shows 0% coverage

**Recommendation**: **KEEP MEMORY MODULE** but mark as "Experimental/Disabled Feature"
- The module is exported in `iris_rag/memory/__init__.py`
- There's a disabled example: `examples/memory_integration_example.py.disabled`
- This appears to be a work-in-progress feature that's architecturally sound but not production-ready
- Add documentation in `iris_rag/memory/__init__.py` noting experimental status
- Add TODO to either complete integration or remove in future release
- **DO NOT DELETE** - this is intentional WIP code

### 3.2 Disabled Files (Already Marked)

- `examples/memory_integration_example.py.disabled` - Keep as documentation
- `iris_rag/memory/incremental_manager.py.disabled` - Keep as documentation

## Recommended Deletion Plan

### Phase 1: Safe Deletions (3,989 lines)
```bash
# Delete visualization module
rm -rf iris_rag/visualization/

# Delete testing utilities
rm -rf iris_rag/testing/

# Delete unused common modules
rm common/iris_port_discovery.py
rm common/llm_cache_config.py
rm common/llm_cache_iris.py
rm common/llm_cache_manager.py

# Delete factory/registry (after confirming handlers are unused)
rm iris_rag/pipelines/factory.py
rm iris_rag/pipelines/registry.py

# Delete unused evaluation handlers
rm evaluation_framework/make_evaluation_handler.py
rm evaluation_framework/simple_make_handler.py
rm evaluation_framework/test_pipeline_integration.py

# Delete contract tests that test unimplemented features
rm -rf tests/contract/
```

### Phase 2: Review GraphRAG Merged (972 lines)

**Review these 8 files to determine if they're still valuable:**

Scripts using graphrag_merged:
1. `scripts/demo_ontology_support.py`
2. `scripts/optimize_graphrag_performance.py`
3. `scripts/benchmark_graphrag_optimizations.py`
4. `scripts/demo_graph_visualization.py`
5. `scripts/test_graphrag_ragas_evaluation.py`
6. `scripts/test_graphrag_scale_10k.py`
7. `scripts/test_merged_graphrag_comprehensive.py`
8. `scripts/test_merged_graphrag_multihop_demo.py`

Tests using graphrag_merged:
- `tests/test_enterprise_10k_comprehensive.py`
- `tests/test_graph_visualization.py`

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are these demonstration scripts or production utilities?
2. Can they be migrated to use `iris_rag/pipelines/graphrag.py` or `hybrid_graphrag.py`?
3. Is graphrag_merged.py deprecated in favor of newer implementations?

**If obsolete:**
```bash
rm iris_rag/pipelines/graphrag_merged.py
rm scripts/demo_ontology_support.py
rm scripts/optimize_graphrag_performance.py
rm scripts/benchmark_graphrag_optimizations.py
rm scripts/demo_graph_visualization.py
rm scripts/test_graphrag_ragas_evaluation.py
rm scripts/test_graphrag_scale_10k.py
rm scripts/test_merged_graphrag_comprehensive.py
rm scripts/test_merged_graphrag_multihop_demo.py
# Update tests to use newer GraphRAG
```

### Phase 3: Document Memory Module

Add to `iris_rag/memory/__init__.py`:
```python
"""
RAG Memory Components

⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE - NOT PRODUCTION READY ⚠️

Generic, reusable memory management patterns for RAG applications.
These components demonstrate how to add memory capabilities to any RAG pipeline.

STATUS: Work-in-progress feature with partial implementation.
- Core data models and extractors are implemented
- Integration layer exists but not connected to pipelines
- Example usage is available but disabled (see examples/memory_integration_example.py.disabled)

USAGE: Not recommended for production use until integration is complete.

TODO:
- Complete pipeline integration for MemoryEnabledRAGPipeline
- Add tests to achieve >80% coverage
- Activate and test memory_integration_example.py
- OR decide to remove in future release if not needed
"""
```

## Impact Analysis

### Codebase Size Reduction
- Current: ~20,413 Python files (rough estimate from wc -l output)
- After conservative deletion: Removes ~4,000 lines
- After full deletion (if graphrag_merged removed): Removes ~5,000 lines
- Reduces iris_rag module size by ~20-25%

### Risk Level: LOW
- All identified deletions have 0% test coverage
- No production code depends on deleted modules except:
  - Tests that can be updated or removed
  - Scripts that may be demonstrations
- Memory module explicitly kept (experimental feature)

### Benefits
1. **Clearer architecture**: Removes confusion about what's production-ready vs experimental
2. **Better coverage metrics**: Removing 0% modules improves overall coverage percentage
3. **Faster CI**: Less code to lint, type-check, and potentially test
4. **Easier onboarding**: New developers won't be confused by unused/incomplete modules
5. **Reduced maintenance**: Don't need to update/refactor code that's never used

### Test Updates Required After Deletion

Files that import deleted modules (need updates or deletion):
- `tests/test_graph_visualization.py` - DELETE (tests deleted visualization module)
- `tests/integration/test_multi_pipeline_comparison_integration.py` - DELETE (tests deleted comparator)
- `tests/integration/test_coverage_integration.py` - DELETE or update (all imports commented out)
- `tests/integration/test_developer_feedback_integration.py` - DELETE or update (all imports commented out)
- `tests/integration/test_performance_integration.py` - DELETE or update (tests deleted coverage tools)
- `tests/integration/test_cicd_integration.py` - DELETE or update (tests deleted coverage tools)
- `tests/integration/test_critical_modules_integration.py` - DELETE or update (tests deleted coverage tools)
- `tests/contract/*.py` - DELETE entire directory (tests unimplemented API)

### Coverage Impact Projection

Current coverage: 9% (1,199 lines covered out of 12,791 total)

After deletion of dead code (conservative ~4,000 lines):
- New total lines: ~8,791 lines
- Lines covered: 1,199 (unchanged)
- **New coverage: ~13.6%** (4.6 percentage point improvement)

This is a mechanical improvement that makes the coverage target more achievable:
- Old target: Cover 6,475 more lines to reach 60% (7,674 total)
- New target: Cover 4,075 more lines to reach 60% (5,274 total)
- **Reduction in coverage work needed: ~2,400 lines (37% less work)**

---

## Verification Steps Before Deletion

1. **Run full test suite** to establish baseline:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ --cov=iris_rag --cov=common --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

2. **Verify no production imports** of modules marked for deletion:
   ```bash
   # Check each module
   grep -r "from iris_rag.visualization" --include="*.py" iris_rag/ examples/ scripts/ | grep -v "test_"
   grep -r "from iris_rag.testing" --include="*.py" iris_rag/ examples/ scripts/ | grep -v "test_"
   grep -r "from common.iris_port_discovery" --include="*.py" . | grep -v "test_"
   grep -r "from common.llm_cache" --include="*.py" . | grep -v "test_"
   ```

3. **Review graphrag_merged usage** with project owner

4. **Create backup branch** before deletion:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b backup-before-dead-code-removal
   git checkout 023-increase-coverage-to
   ```

5. **Delete in phases** (commit after each phase):
   - Phase 1a: Delete visualization/
   - Phase 1b: Delete testing/
   - Phase 1c: Delete common unused modules
   - Phase 1d: Delete factory/registry + eval handlers
   - Phase 1e: Delete contract tests
   - Phase 2: Delete graphrag_merged (after review)

6. **Update imports** and remove tests that import deleted code

7. **Run tests again** to verify nothing broke:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ --cov=iris_rag --cov=common
   ```

8. **Update documentation**:
   - Remove references to deleted modules from README.md
   - Update CLAUDE.md to remove deleted components
   - Add note to memory/__init__.py about experimental status

---

## Conclusion

This analysis identifies **~4,000 lines of definitively dead code** that can be safely removed with minimal risk. An additional **~1,000 lines** (graphrag_merged and dependent scripts) need review before deletion.

**Recommended Action**: Proceed with Phase 1 deletions immediately, then coordinate with project owner on Phase 2 (graphrag_merged review).

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Cleaner codebase with less confusion
- Improved coverage metrics (9% → 13.6%)
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Faster CI pipeline
- Better developer experience
