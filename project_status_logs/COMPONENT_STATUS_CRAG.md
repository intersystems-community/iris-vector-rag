## Status History Log

*   **2025-05-31 - Status: ❓ UNTESTED**
    *   **Notes:** The May 31st benchmark report ([`comprehensive_benchmark_report_20250531_073304.md`](../comprehensive_benchmark_report_20250531_073304.md:1)) claimed 100% success but also showed 1.000 avg similarity which might be an anomaly or an issue with the metric itself for this technique in that run. Previous status documents also claimed success, but these are now considered unreliable. The technique requires fresh, reliable end-to-end testing to confirm its actual operational status. Some earlier (May 30th) benchmark JSONs might indicate 0 documents retrieved.
    *   **Evidence:** [`../comprehensive_benchmark_report_20250531_073304.md`](../comprehensive_benchmark_report_20250531_073304.md:1) (See line 24). Also, compare with other techniques showing 0 documents or 0 similarity.
