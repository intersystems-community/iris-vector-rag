## Status History Log

*   **2025-05-31 - Status: ❓ UNTESTED**
    *   **Notes:** The May 31st benchmark report ([`comprehensive_benchmark_report_20250531_073304.md`](../comprehensive_benchmark_report_20250531_073304.md:1)) claimed 100% success. However, previous status documents also claimed success for all techniques and are now considered unreliable. The technique requires fresh, reliable end-to-end testing to confirm its actual operational status.
    *   **Evidence:** [`../comprehensive_benchmark_report_20250531_073304.md`](../comprehensive_benchmark_report_20250531_073304.md:1) (See line 23 for HyDE).
