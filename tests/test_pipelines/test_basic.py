    # The current common.iris_connector.py (lines 42-62) when config is None *only* uses ConfigurationManager.
    # So, mock_os_environ_get might not be called in this specific test path.
    # If it's not called, an assert_called_once_with or assert_any_call would fail.
    # This is fine, as it means ConfigurationManager was correctly prioritized.
    # For a robust test, we might check mock_os_environ_get.called is False if that's the expected behavior.
    # However, the prompt implies os.environ.get *is* mocked to return *different* credentials,
    # suggesting it might be checked by the SUT.
    # Let's assume for now the critical check is that jaydebeapi.connect used CM creds.
