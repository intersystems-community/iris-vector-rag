                Insulin plays a critical role in diabetes management. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas 
                produces little or no insulin, requiring external insulin administration. In type 2 diabetes, 
                cells become resistant to insulin's action, eventually leading to inadequate insulin production.
                
                Insulin therapy helps regulate blood glucose levels by facilitating glucose uptake into cells.
                Different types include rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, and long-acting insulin,
                each with different onset and duration times.
                
                Proper insulin dosing must be balanced with food intake and physical activity to avoid
                hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps have
                improved diabetes management significantly in recent years.

                Recent advances in cancer treatment include targeted immunotherapies and personalized

                by reprogramming the patient's own immune cells to attack cancer cells.
                
                Precision oncology uses genetic testing to identify specific mutations driving cancer growth,
                allowing for tailored treatment approaches. Small molecule inhibitors targeting specific

                Epidemiological studies have established associations between diabetes and increased risk

                Several mechanisms may explain these relationships: hyperinsulinemia in type 2 diabetes can
                promote cancer cell proliferation; chronic inflammation common in both conditions creates a
                favorable environment for cancer development; and shared risk factors such as obesity
                contribute to both diseases.
                
                Metformin, a common diabetes medication, has shown potential anti-cancer properties in some
                studies, possibly by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways that inhibit
                cancer cell growth. Conversely, some diabetes treatments may increase cancer risk, highlighting
                the complex interplay between these conditions and the importance of personalized treatment approaches.

                Knowledge graphs provide powerful frameworks for representing complex medical relationships.
                By modeling entities (e.g., diseases, drugs, genes) as nodes and relationships as edges,
                knowledge graphs can capture the intricate interactions within biological systems.
                
                In medical research, these graphs enable the discovery of non-obvious connections between
                seemingly unrelated conditions. For example, graph analysis has identified shared molecular
                pathways between cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's, suggesting potential for drug
                repurposing.
