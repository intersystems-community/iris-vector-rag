"""
Unit test for GraphRAG entity extraction validation bug.

Bug Report: /Users/tdyar/ws/kg-ticket-resolver/RAG_TEMPLATES_BUG_ENTITY_EXTRACTION.md

The bug: GraphRAGPipeline.load_documents() incorrectly throws exception claiming
no entities were extracted, even when entities ARE successfully extracted and stored.

Root Cause: Fallback path only increments total_entities if result["stored"]=True,
but extraction can succeed while storage fails, leading to false negative.

Fix: Always count extracted entities regardless of storage status. Only fail if
zero entities are EXTRACTED (not zero entities stored).
