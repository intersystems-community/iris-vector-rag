        "answer": "Metformin is a common medication used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is often prescribed as a first-line treatment and works by helping to lower glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity. This means that metformin helps to lower blood sugar levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes by making the body more responsive to insulin and reducing the amount of glucose produced by the liver. By addressing these underlying issues, metformin can help to improve blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is important to note that metformin is just one component of a comprehensive treatment plan for type 2 diabetes, which may also include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, as well as other medications or insulin therapy in some cases.",
