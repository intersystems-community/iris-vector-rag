Here we monitor the progressive loss of robustness in an in vitro model of the early stages of transformation that comprises normal keratinocytes and progressive passages of HPV16 immortalized cells. As transformation progresses, the cells acquire higher proliferation rates and gain the ability to grow in soft agar. Concurrently, the cells lose robustness, becoming more sensitive to serum starvation and DNA damage by Cisplatin. Loss of robustness in the course of transformation correlates with significant reductions in the activities of the anti-apoptotic proteins PKB/Akt, Erk, Jnk and p38 both under normal growth conditions and upon stress. In parallel, loss of robustness is manifested by the shrinkage of the number of growth factors that can rescue starving cells from apoptosis, with the emergence of dependence solely on IGF1. Treatment with IGF1 activates PKB/Akt and Jnk and through them inhibits p53, rescuing the cells from starvation. We conclude that transformation in this model induces higher susceptibility of cells to stress due to reduced anti-apoptotic signaling and hyper-activation of p53 upon stress.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer development is a multi-step process in which cells gain high proliferation rates and resistance to apoptotic signals. In this long process cells accumulate mutations and chromosomal aberrations due to impaired cell cycle control and DNA repair mechanisms. In the past few decades, thousands of research projects have characterized tumor suppressors and oncogenes, which have abnormal activities in human cancers. Two tumor suppressors, p53 and Rb, have been shown to be inactive in the vast majority of cancers. Their inactivation impairs cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to cell damage. On the other hand, the enhanced activities of oncogenes, such as receptor tyrosine kinases, among them the IGF1 receptor, induce higher proliferation rates and resistance to apoptotic stimuli. Much less effort has been devoted to characterizing the initial steps of transformation. This is mostly due to the lack of a cell system that encompasses the continuum from the normal cell through full transformation. When comparisons are made, they refer to the fully-transformed tumor cell in comparison to its normal untransformed counterpart.</p><p>Human Papilloma virus, primarily types 16 (HPV16) and 18 (HPV18), are considered to be the causative agents for cervical cancer and other anogenital lesions <xref rid="pone.0000605-Sanclemente1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Infection induces immortalization of cells, mainly as a result of activation of two viral genes: E6 and E7. The E6 protein targets p53 for proteasomal degradation, and E7 targets Rb for proteasomal degradation <xref rid="pone.0000605-Werness1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0000605-Boyer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus the E6 and E7 proteins interfere with cell cycle control and apoptosis, and induce genomic instability in cells <xref rid="pone.0000605-zurHausen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. HPV infection is responsible for cell immortalization, but full transformation and tumor formation occur only years after infection. During the period between infection and cancer development, the cells accumulate mutations, which eventually cause full transformation.</p><p>In this study we monitor changes in the early stages of transformation, before cancer development. We have previously suggested that transformed cells are more sensitive to stress, which may partially account for their enhanced sensitivity to cytotoxic agents <xref rid="pone.0000605-Benhar1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000605-Benhar2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In that study, we compared immortalized NIH3T3 cells to immortalized NIH 3T3 cells expressing oncogenes. In the current study we have monitored the progressive sensitization to stress upon the immortalization of normal cells and during the initial steps of transformation, characterizing the changes in the pre-malignant stage. Using an in-vitro cellular model system for the development of cervical cancer, we have correlated the gradual development of sensitivity to stress with the degree of cell transformation. We examined HPV16-immortalized keratinocytes extensively passaged in vitro, HF1 cells, comparing cells from early and late passages. In late passages cells gain higher proliferation rate and acquire the ability to form colonies in soft agar, but still do not form tumors in nude mice, therefore have not reached full transformation. Using this model of progressive cellular transformation, we could compare immortalized cells from various stages with their normal counterpart, namely, uninfected human keratinocytes. When comparing normal keratinocytes to cells in early passage (&#x0223c;60 doublings) after HPV16 transfection, we are monitoring early events caused by the expression of HPV16 genes. The differences between late passages (&#x0223c;1000 doublings) and early passages most likely result from additional genetic and epigenetic changes in these cells. We find that sensitivity to serum starvation and to Cisplatin (CDDP) treatment correlates with the number of passages. Moreover, as transformation proceeds in our model, there is a reduction in the activity of key anti-apoptotic proteins, PKB/Akt, Erk, Jnk and p38, and increased activation of p53 upon stress. During starvation the transformed cells become dependent on IGF1, which activates the above mentioned kinases, and inhibits p53. Treatment with IGF1 rescues the cells via activation of PKB/Akt and Jnk, and through them, inhibition of p53 induction. Similar results were obtained using an independent line of HPV16-immortalized keratinocytes, HPKII cells, but not with the fully transformed SiHa line. Sensitivity to stress correlates with high induction of p53 activity, which is reduced with IGF1 treatment and activation of PKB/Akt. We conclude that during early stages of cellular transformation, cells gain higher proliferation rate, which occurs concurrently with higher activation of p53 and a decrease in cell robustness.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Materials</title><p>Cell culture reagents were purchased as follows: DMEM, HAM/F12, RPMI and antibiotics from Biological Industries Israel Beit Ha'emek Ltd.; FBS from Gibco BRL; EGF from Peprotech Inc.; insulin, T3, transferrin, cholera toxin and hydrocortisone from Sigma.

We compared primary human keratinocytes to HPV16 transformed cells, HF1 cells, from early stages (&#x0223c;60 doublings post transfection) and late stages (&#x0223c;1000 doublings post transfection). As a first step in cell characterization we monitored the growth rates of the various cell types by methylene blue assay. As transformation proceeded growth was accelerated and doubling time was reduced from &#x0003e;24 h in the primary keratinocytes to 22 h in early HF1 and 16 h in late HF1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, early in transformation cells gained the ability to survive and grow in soft agar. Primary keratinocytes, early and late HF1 cells were plated in soft agar and grown for two weeks, followed by staining of live cells with MTT. In contrast to the primary keratinocytes, immortalized HF1 cells survived in soft agar. Early HF1 cells survived, but did not proliferate and did not form colonies in soft agar, and are therefore seen as MTT-stained single cells. In contrast, late HF1 cells formed both micro-colonies and more rarely large colonies in soft agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Introduction of late HF1 cells into nude mice did not result in tumor formation, so they are not considered fully transformed cells. Therefore higher proliferation rate and growth in soft agar are first steps in cancer progression to full malignant phenotype.</p><fig id="pone-0000605-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000605.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Early transformation induces higher growth rate and enables growth in soft agar.</title><p>A.

Cells were stained with propidium iodide and submitted to FACS analysis. The sub-G1 fraction was quantified as a measure of cell death. Serum deprivation for 48 h did not induce any increase in cell death of the primary keratinocytes, but rather slightly reduced it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, serum withdrawal induced 22&#x00025; death in early HF1 cells, and 32&#x00025; death in the more transformed, late HF1 cells. Western blot analysis of cells after 24 h serum starvation and reaction of the blots with anti-PARP antibody showed that cells died via apoptosis. In primary keratinocytes, which were not affected by starvation, PARP was not cleaved. PARP was clearly cleaved upon starvation of early HF1 cells and even more dramatically in late HF1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We also immuno-stained cytochrome C to monitor its release from the mitochondria. We already detected cytochrome C release after 12 h of starvation in late HF1 cells, but not in primary keratinocytes or early HF1 cells, which are more resistant to the stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In order to see whether the increased sensitivity to stress was a more general phenomenon or restricted to starvation, we exposed the cells to the DNA damaging agent, Cisplatin.

Stress induced faster activation of mitochondrial apoptosis, which results in caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. The fact that only HF1 cells, but not the primary keratinocytes, were sensitive to serum starvation provided a convenient, clear-cut system for further analysis. We therefore concentrated our studies on the response of HF1 cells to serum starvation.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>The involvement of p53 in Rb in the response to stress</title><p>It has been shown that expression of the E6 or E7 genes of HPV often increases stress sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0000605-Rey1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0000605-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Since transformation in our system initiated with HPV16 transfection, we examined the expression of the viral genes and their targets, p53 and Rb, to see whether the increased stress sensitivity could be attributed to their expression. Since there are no efficient antibodies against E6, and the E6 and E7 genes are co-regulated, E7 expression is a valid indicator for viral gene expression. The E7 protein was very highly expressed in early HF1 cells, and its level was markedly reduced in late HF1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Our results suggest that the viral proteins trigger the initiation of transformation, but their effects are reduced in later stages. In agreement with the expression of E7, the Rb protein level was reduced in early HF1 cells, but elevated in late HF1 cells. Thus Rb expression did not correlate with sensitivity to stress.</p><fig id="pone-0000605-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000605.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>P53 and Rb under basal conditions and during starvation.</title><p>A.

P53 appeared in the western blot as three bands; the lower band was intensified in late HF1 cells, but the other two almost disappeared. Sequencing of p53 cDNA in these cells revealed no mutation or deletion in the p53 coding sequence (data not shown), so the three bands appear to represent wt p53 with different post-translational modifications. The p53 protein is very highly regulated, mainly via phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation <xref rid="pone.0000605-Appella1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Reaction with several antibodies that recognize different phosphorylated forms of p53 did not shed light on the protein's activity in the various cell types (not shown). In order to compare p53 activity in the three cell types under normal growth conditions we looked at the expression of p53 targets. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000605-t001">Table 1</xref> shows expression levels of six known p53 targets, which were obtained from Affymetrix micro-arrays (Kravchenko-Balasha, in preparation). There was a gradual decrease in the expression of GADD45, p21, MMP2 and TGFalpha from the primary keratinocytes through early HF1 cells, to late HF1 cells. NOXA and IGFBP3 expression rose slightly in early HF1 cells, but was dramatically reduced in the later stage. GAPDH expression is given as an internal control for constant mRNA expression. NOXA is a known mediator of the anti-apoptotic effects of p53 <xref rid="pone.0000605-Schuler1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We therefore validated the micro-array results by real-time PCR of this gene and normalized NOXA expression to the expression of the house-keeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Indeed, NOXA RNA levels rose slightly in early HF1 cells, but was markedly reduced in late HF1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

We used NOXA as a marker for pro-apoptotic p53 activity. Surprisingly, real-time PCR of NOXA showed that although the basal NOXA RNA level was reduced, induction in response to starvation increased as transformation proceeded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We confirmed these results with a reporter assay, where firefly-luciferase (FFL) was expressed under the control of p53-response elements, with mutant response elements serving as controls. Differences in transfection efficiency were eliminated by normalization to renilla-luciferase under the control of the CMV-promoter. FFL activity was measured under basal growth conditions and following 24 h starvation. FFL expression was not induced by starvation in the primary keratinocytes, but was induced slightly in early HF1 cells, and reached 5-fold induction in late HF1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

Due to very low transfection efficiency, and high toxicity of the transfection reagents, we could not introduce dominant-negative constructs or siRNA into the cells. We therefore used a pharmacological approach. First we looked for factors that would rescue the cells from apoptosis when added to the starvation medium and examined the effects of selective pharmacological agents on their action. HF1 cells were starved for 48 h in the presence of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), neuregulin (NRG), or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). The first three are major factors involved in epithelial cell growth and survival <xref rid="pone.0000605-DePotter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0000605-Rodeck1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and stimulate known anti-apoptotic pathways.

We examined cell death by propidium iodide staining and quantification of the sub-G1 fraction of the cell cycle. All four factors reduced the fraction of apoptotic cells. Early HF1 cells were rescued completely by both IGF1 and EGF, while NRG and LPA had smaller effects. Late HF1 cells were rescued completely by IGF1, while EGF, NRG and LPA had weaker effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

Cell cycle analysis after 48 h starvation with or without IGF1 showed that starvation increased the sub-G1 fraction, accompanied by a reduction in the fraction of cells in the S and G2/M phases, mainly in late HF1 cells. Rescue by IGF1 reduced the sub-G1 fraction in both cell types, accompanied by an increase in the fraction of cells in G1. IGF1 did not change the fraction of cells in S phase and had only a minor effect on cells in G2/M. Under these conditions, IGF1 transmitted a strong anti-apoptotic signal for survival, but did not suffice for cell cycle progression. Thus the cells became dependent on a single agent, IGF1, for survival under serum starvation.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>IGF1 rescues HF1 cells via activation of PKB/Akt and JNK and inactivation of p53</title><p>IGF1 is an upstream regulator of: PKB/Akt, Erk, Jnk, p38 and p53 <xref rid="pone.0000605-Edmondson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000605-Pollak1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0000605-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. We therefore explored which of these proteins mediate survival of HF1 cells under stress. To determine which pathway downstream of the IGF1R is responsible for the rescuing activity of IGF1, we first studied which signaling proteins are stimulated by IGF1. We serum starved the cells for 24 h and added IGF1 either during the whole starvation period or during the last 10 min before cell lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). We looked at the phosphorylation of the above-mentioned IGF1R targets: PKB/Akt, Erk, Jnk and p38. PKB/Akt was phosphorylated by IGF1, after both short and long stimulations. PKB/Akt phosphorylation was very high following the short stimulation, but even after 24 h stimulation the phosphorylation level of PKB/Akt was at least as high as the level in the presence of 10&#x00025; serum. Erk, Jnk and p38 were activated only after short stimulation with IGF1, but might nevertheless have initiated long-term effects. P53 activity, as detected by NOXA expression was down-regulated by IGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the effects of specific kinase inhibitors on IGF1-mediated rescue from starvation. In early HF1 cells, treatment with the PKB/Akt inhibitor or the JNK inhibitor SP600125, abrogated the IGF1 effect completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that PKB/Akt and Jnk are responsible for the IGF1R-mediated rescue. In late HF1 cells, again PKB/Akt inhibition and Jnk inhibition showed the strongest effects, but only partially reversed IGF1 rescue. In contrast, the Erk inhibitor PD98059 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 had no effect on cell survival.

In contrast, in SiHa cells, where the activities of these enzymes are even lower than in starved HPKII cells, p53 is not induced and cells survive upon starvation, most likely due to the presence of other anti-apoptotic networks, which have emerged on the path to full transformation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In an attempt to understand the long process that leads to HPV16-mediated transformation, we have compared primary human keratinocytes and HPV16-immortalized keratinocytes, HF1 and HPKII cells, at various stages of in vitro transformation. Presumably, most of the differences between primary keratinocytes and early passage HF1 and HPKII cells are related to the introduction of the HPV16 genome, and the differences between early passage and late passage HF1 and HPKII cells, result from prolonged passaging in vitro. As the HF1 cells became progressively more transformed their growth rate accelerated and they gained the ability to survive in soft agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Late passage HF1 and HPKII cells can be considered to be pre-cancerous. Although they did not form detectable tumors in nude mice, HPKII cells did form benign cysts <xref rid="pone.0000605-Durst1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000605-Braun1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. During the course of transformation, the HPV16-immortalized cells became more prone to cell death upon stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g002">Figure 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g007">7</xref>). These results are supported by previous findings showing that transfection of cells with the HPV16 E6 gene sensitizes cells to genotoxic stress <xref rid="pone.0000605-Pestell1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. E6 expression impairs nucleotide excision repair, reducing the cells' capability to recover from DNA damage <xref rid="pone.0000605-Rey1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and E7 expression reduces survival after UV irradiation <xref rid="pone.0000605-Billecke1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Impairment of cell-cycle control due to Rb and p53 down-regulation would be expected to result in cell death in response to environmental stress. Indeed, early HF1 cells highly express HPV16 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and show higher sensitivity to both serum starvation and Cisplatin compared to normal keratinocytes. In the more transformed late HF1 cells, however, HPV16 gene expression is reduced; therefore their expression cannot be the immediate cause of the even greater sensitivity in these stages.</p><p>The interplay between p53 and Rb is very complex and involves the E2F transcription factor family. Rb binds and inhibits the E2Fs, which stabilize and activate p53 by several mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0000605-Sherr1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. First, E2F upregulates p14ARF, which reduces Mdm2-induced degradation of p53 <xref rid="pone.0000605-Sherr1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Moreover, it induces transcription of ATM, which phosphorylates and stabilizes p53 <xref rid="pone.0000605-Berkovich1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and can also upregulate the p53 binding partners, ASPP1/2, JMY, TP53INP1, which elevate p53 pro-apoptotic activity <xref rid="pone.0000605-Hershko1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Here we have shown high E7 expression and low Rb level in early HF1 cells, implying high E2F activity. E2F activation of p53 may counteract E6 activity, explaining why p53 was only slightly affected in early HF1 cells. In contrast, in late HF1 cells we found high Rb levels, which may have led to lower E2F activity, and hence to the very low basal activity of p53 in these cells.</p><p>The reduction in HPV16 gene expression in late HF1 cells is most probably caused by changes in cellular signaling components. HPV16 gene expression has been shown to be controlled by cellular factors such as AP1, NF1 and glucocorticoids, which bind the P97 HPV promoter <xref rid="pone.0000605-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000605-Chong1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. We show that in late HF1 cells MAP kinase activity is decreased compared to early HF1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Reduced MAP kinase activity is expected to cause reduced AP1 activity, leading to the observed reduction in HPV expression, and the rise in Rb level in late HF1 cells. Indeed, results from our laboratory show AP1 activity is markedly reduced in late HF1 cells (Kravchenko-Balasha et al, in preparation). Changes in Rb level during cervical cancer development have been documented by Salcedo et al <xref rid="pone.0000605-Salcedo1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. These authors showed that Rb levels were low in HPV16 infected, pathologically normal epithelium, but rose in squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), a pre-cancerous state. Rb expression was then reduced in invasive cervical cancer. Possibly late HF1 cells represent a stage similar to SIL, an intermediate stage of transformation.</p><p>The amount of p53 was only slightly reduced with transformation, but there was a marked difference in its activity and electrophoretic mobility, suggesting different post-translational modifications of the protein. The activity of p53 was markedly reduced in late HF1, cells as assessed by the transcription of its targets. We examined p53 induction both by real-time PCR of NOXA and by reporter assay. Surprisingly, we found that p53 induction in response to stress increased with transformation, even though basal p53 activity was very low in the more transformed cells. While p53 activity was not induced at all by stress in primary keratinocytes, and was only slightly induced in early HF1 cells, there was a 5&#x02013;7 fold induction in late HF1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g003">Figure 3C,D</xref>) and 3.5 fold induction in HPKII cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). In fully transformed SiHa cells, we detected no activation of p53 upon starvation, neither was apoptosis induced. It has been shown that SiHa cells have very high Stat3 activity <xref rid="pone.0000605-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, which may prevent p53 induction <xref rid="pone.0000605-Niu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and account for the resistance of SiHa cells to stress. These cells also highly express the anti-apoptotic BH3 protein MCL1 <xref rid="pone.0000605-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Thus, it seems that SiHa cells represent the transformed state beyond the addictive stage, when robustness has been re-established. It has been reported that p53 can be activated in these cells in response to adriamycin treatment, but not in response to oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide <xref rid="pone.0000605-Lembo1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Presumably the differential response to various stresses and various stress intensities, results in disparity in p53 activation, which leads to differential cell fate.</p><p>Little is known about p53 induction in normal epithelial cells. Girinsky et al <xref rid="pone.0000605-Girinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> showed that p53 is highly induced in response to stress in normal stromal cells, but they detected no induction in normal epithelial cells. The reasons for these differences are still unknown, but most probably reflect the robustness of the normal keratinocyte. Perhaps, the lack of p53 activation in normal epithelial cells increases their resistance to various external stresses, and may be essential for epithelial tissue integrity.</p><p>The increased apoptosis in late HF1 cells, in conjunction with the increase in stress-induced p53 pro-apoptotic activity, led us to investigate anti-apoptotic signaling. We detected a decrease in the activity of key anti-apoptotic signaling components in HF1 cells. The phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and Erk, Jnk and p38 was gradually reduced as a function of the degree of transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), while total protein levels remained almost constant. Other studies have shown high activities of Akt and Erk in fully transformed cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0000605-FresnoVara1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000605-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Many cancer models were developed by introduction of active oncogenes into primary or immortalized cells <xref rid="pone.0000605-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In these models it is expected that anti-apoptotic proteins would be activated by the introduced oncogenes even during early stages. In contrast, our model mimics the physiological situation, in which normal cells are infected with HPV16, and the cells replicate for years and accumulate mutations. The phenomenon of decreased anti-apoptotic signaling during cancer development is supported by our results from SiHa cells, which show low activities of PKB/Akt, Erk, Jnk and p38. We propose that reduced anti-apoptotic activities of the above-mentioned proteins are a common feature in transformation, where in both HF1 and HPKII PKB seems to play a key role, where in the latter is more prominent.</p><p>During stress, anti-apoptotic proteins are often activated by several autocrine pathways, and enable cell survival <xref rid="pone.0000605-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000605-Nishino1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Full blown cancer cells utilize growth factors such as IGF1 to overcome stress or pro-apoptotic signals, by re-igniting the downstream pathways. In HF1 cells, phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, Erk, Jnk and p38 was reduced during serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In HPKII cells, although we did not detect a similar reduction in anti-apoptotic activities under normal growth conditions, we did see that the activities of PKB/Akt, Erk, Jnk and p38 are mostly reduced upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Nonetheless, the inactivation of these growth-promoting anti-apoptotic proteins during starvation did not enable survival of the transformed cells during stress. Apparently, in late stage HF1 and HPKII cells we &#x0201c;capture&#x0201d; the transformation process at a stage just prior to the onset of autocrine activation characteristic of fully neoplastic cells. Namely at this stage cells are hyper-sensitive to stress (see also ref. 9).</p><p>We found a correlation between p53 induction, decreased anti-apoptotic signaling upon starvation and sensitivity to stress. To confirm the connection between these factors we tried to activate the anti-apoptotic proteins, or inactivate p53 in early and late HF1 cells, and reverse the effect. We were able to rescue the cells from apoptosis by adding IGF1 to the starvation medium. As transformation proceeds cell dependence on IGF1 increased. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g005">Figure 5A</xref> shows that late HF1 cells are fully rescued only by IGF1, while early HF1 cells could also be rescued by EGF, implying that the late HF1 cells had become addicted to IGF1. Cervical cancer cells have been shown to become dependent on IGF1R activity for their growth and survival <xref rid="pone.0000605-Mitsiades1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0000605-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> . It has also been shown that in early stages of transformation cells depend on external IGF1, secreted from stromal cells, while fully transformed cancer cells secrete IGF1, and their survival depends on this autocrine pathway <xref rid="pone.0000605-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Here, IGF1 induced a strong anti-apoptotic signal rather than a proliferative signal. IGF1 treatment enabled cell survival during starvation, but did not enable cell cycle progression in the absence of nutrients, and therefore treatment resulted in arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Thus, our data suggest that the property of cancer cells being addicted to a particular pathway <xref rid="pone.0000605-Weinstein1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> develops in the precancerous stage.</p><p>We found that PKB/Akt and Jnk activities were up-regulated and p53 activity down-regulated by IGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Accordingly, Inhibition of PKB/Akt or Jnk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) led to activation of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000605-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), and therefore abrogation of the IGF1 rescuing activity. We conclude that during stress, low activity of PKB/Akt and Jnk enables p53 activation and apoptosis in late HF1 cells. The importance of PKB/Akt in mediating the rescue effect of IGF1 was shown here also in HPKII cells.</p><p>IGF1 and EGF very often transmit their signal through similar down-stream signaling pathways. One possible explanation for the higher potency of IGF1 in the rescue of HF1 cells may come from different levels of their receptors. Another explanation may come from their effects on the IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). It has been shown that p53 induces transcription of IGFBP3 <xref rid="pone.0000605-Buckbinder1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Moreover, IGFBP3 was induced by serum starvation, and induction was inhibited by EGF <xref rid="pone.0000605-Hembree1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. In our system both EGF and IGF1 may down-regulate p53, possibly leading to decreased expression of IGFBP3. Exogenous IGF1, but not EGF might surmount the low levels of IGFBP3, leading to rescue from starvation.</p><p>In summary, using an in vitro model of keratinocyte transformation by HPV16, we have shown that during the course of transformation, cells develop increased sensitivity to stress, which correlates with higher activation of p53 and reductions in the activities of PKB/Akt, Erk, Jnk and p38 in HF1 cells. We show that the low activities of PKB/Akt and Jnk are responsible for the increased cell death of late HF1 cells, and that their low activities during stress enable p53 induction and initiation of apoptosis, when deprived of IGF1, and nutrients. The reduction in the anti-apoptotic activity reduces the robustness of the transformed cells and results in more cell death. We show that as transformation progresses cells become more dependent on IGF1 for their survival. Normal epithelial tissue seems to be resistant to damaging agents, most probably because of the robustness of the anti-apoptotic network, and the quiescent p53. During transformation normal tissue integrity and function are impaired, anti-apoptotic signals are down-regulated, leading to hyper-activation of p53 and increased cell death in response to stress. Similar results were obtained with HPKII cells, which were developed independently. Significantly, SiHa cells, which represent fully transformed HPV16 infected cells, are robust and do not succumb to starvation, most likely since they have acquired an anti-apoptotic network in which Stat3 and MCL-1 may play a pivotal role <xref rid="pone.0000605-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000605-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> . Our results suggest that on the path of HPV16 induced transformation, cells acquire addiction to IGF1 but, when progressing to the fully malignant phenotype, they overcome this Achilles heel and re-establish robustness, characteristic of cancers refractory to therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Prof. Hannah Ben-Bassat and Malka Chaouat from Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, for stimulating discussions, for preparing and providing primary keratinocytes regularly, and for the HF1 cells in early and late passages.
