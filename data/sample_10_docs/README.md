# Static Sample Set of 10 PMC Documents

## Purpose

This directory contains a static sample set of 10 PMC (PubMed Central) XML documents.
It is intended for rapid local testing of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) components
and pipelines without requiring a database connection or large-scale data ingestion.

This allows for quick verification of file parsing, basic processing, and test-driven
development of functionalities that operate on PMC XML data.

## Included PMC IDs

The following 10 PMC documents are included in this sample set:

1.  PMC524367
2.  PMC545955
3.  PMC526216
4.  PMC539322
5.  PMC1894889
6.  PMC1174865
7.  PMC1904256
8.  PMC2435152
9.  PMC2276224
10. PMC2011213

## Note

This is a small, fixed dataset for local development and testing. It does not
represent the full scale or diversity of the complete PMC dataset. For more
comprehensive testing or production use, please refer to the full data ingestion
pipelines and the larger datasets.
