Introduction</title><p>Pregnancy is a special term in life with physiological changes in both cardiorespiratory and immune systems; that is why severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection in pregnancy may result in an altered response. Fetuses may be exposed to infection during critical periods of development; especially first-trimester exposure is miscellaneous. There are mostly case reports of second and third-trimester pregnancies with SARS-CoV2 infection in the literature and meta-analysis, and systemic reviews done based on those case reports. With this, we present a case report of a young pregnant lady who was exposed to SARS-CoV2 infection just before pregnancy and ended up with an affected fetus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>2. Case presentation</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>2.1. Patient information</title><p>Twenty-five-year-old woman who has no history of genetic or chronic diseases applied to our clinic for routine control of pregnancy. She does not have a consanguineous marriage or any other potential risk factors for pregnancy. She had a history of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) PCR positivity 2 days before the first day of the last menstruation period and hospitalization for 7 days. At her admission to the hospital with weakness of muscles and flu-like symptoms (cough, dizziness, and headache), physical examination findings were at normal range rather than increased respiratory rate: fever measured as 37 <bold>&#176;</bold>C, oxygen saturation was 98%, and blood pressure was 110/70&#8201;mm Hg. Covid PCR test was positive and computed tomography showed an atypical viral pneumonia-like frosted glass image at the posterobasal segment at the left lung lower lobe. Blood tests resulted in thrombocytopenia (131&#8197;&#215;&#8197;10<sup>3</sup>/&#181;L) and C reactive protein (CRP) was 7.2&#8201;mg/dL (0&#8211;0.5&#8201;mg/dL). Her beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta hCG) blood test result was negative. After hospitalization during her follow-up when fever was measured as 38 <bold>&#176;</bold>C, blood culture tests were taken and resulted negative. During her follow-up the results of leucocyte, thrombocyte, and CRP were 3.48&#8197;&#215;&#8197;10<sup>3</sup>/&#181;L, 116&#8197;&#215;&#8197;10<sup>3</sup>/&#181;L, and 6.8&#8201;mg/dL, respectively. After 7 days of treatment with favipiravir and levofloxacin, enoxaparin sodium, famotidine, paracetamol, budesonide, dornaz alfa, and vitamin C; her general situation gets better, and discharged from the hospital on 7th day of hospitalization without any further treatment prescription. On her discharge day, leucocyte, thrombocyte, and CRP tests resulted in 4.5&#8197;&#215;&#8197;10<sup>3</sup>/&#181;L, 114&#8197;&#215;&#8197;10<sup>3</sup>/&#181;L, and 3.2&#8201;mg/dL, respectively. One week after hospitalization COVID PCR test resulted as negative and beta hCG resulted positive 2 weeks after hospital discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2. Clinical findings and diagnostic assessment</title><p>During her routine controls for pregnancy at first-trimester evaluation ultrasonography; no anomalies related to the head, neck, vertebra, thorax, heart, abdominal wall, stomach, kidneys, or bladder were seen. Nazal bone was also seen and there was not any reverse ductal current in Doppler ultrasonography. There was right forearm aplasia and deformities at both feet and legs. Other than isolated anomalies at extremities, all fetal biometry measurements were normal, the amniotic fluid index was at normal range and the posteriorly located placenta seems natural. First-trimester ultrasonographic images can be seen in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Chorionic villus sampling and DNA analysis: whole exome sequencing was done. Whole exome sequencing resulted as negative and there was no variant gene to explain sirenomelia. Sirenomelia is characterized by complete or incomplete fused lower extremities, renal agenesis, oligohydramnios, absent urinary tract and external genitalia, single umbilical arteries, and imperforate anus.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> It is a very rare lethal congenital anomaly; a retrospective cohort study done in North and South America, Europe, China, and Australia showed global incidence as 0.98/100,000.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Perinatology offered the option of termination of pregnancy to the patient. The pregnancy terminated on the 13th of the gestational week and was sent to a genetic laboratory for further analysis. In Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, images of the fetus with sirenomelia and forearm aplasia can be seen.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>First-trimester ultrasonographic images.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="medi-103-e39504-g001.jpg"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Fetus with forearm aplasia and sirenomelia.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="medi-103-e39504-g002.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec><title>2.3. Follow-up and outcomes</title><p>Today, she already got pregnant for the second time and there were not any anticipated problems during her pregnancy follow-ups and she gave a healthy birth with a cesarean operation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>As the fetal organs develop during the first trimester of the pregnancy, maternal infections at this stage may be more dangerous compared to later gestational ages.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> This case has great significance since the patient has COVID-19 disease and treatment before beta hCG test positivity. That comes with a question does medicine or COVID-19 disease affect ovum quality and cause fetal malformation before even implantation? Literature has limited case reports about confronting the virus in the first trimester: and most of them report miscarriage rather than any malformation. Setti et al compared infertile couples&#8217; artificial reproductive techniques outcomes between the pre-COVID and COVID-19 periods and results show no significant differences in terms of pregnancies per cycle (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8197;=&#8197;.237), biochemical pregnancy rates (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8197;=&#8197;.089), ectopic pregnancy (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8197;=&#8197;.594), spontaneous miscarriage (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8197;=&#8197;.487), and intrauterine ongoing pregnancies (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8197;=&#8197;.569).<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> La Cour Freiesleben et al in their cohort study showed that SARS-CoV2 infection does not have a significant effect on nuchal translucency thickness measured at the first-trimester scan and does not have a significant increase in pregnancy loss.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup></p><p>In another study by Liu et al, there were no statistical differences in terms of percentages of cesarean, premature rupture of membranes, pregnancy with hypothyroidism, placental abnormality, abnormal amniotic fluid volume, pregnancy with thrombocytopenia, pregnancy with anemia (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8197;&gt;&#8197;.05) between COVID-19 infected and the control groups; the rates of gestational diabetes mellitus was higher in COVID-19 infected group (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8197;&lt;&#8197;.05).<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>In the literature, most of the reports are about 2nd and 3rd trimester COVID-19 positivity. When the patient confronts the virus in the second trimester; preterm birth or intrauterine growth restriction are the main outcomes with the increased occurrence and when the patient confronts the virus in the third trimester; there are cases of fetal deaths. The authors mainly emphasize the fact of intense placental inflammatory reaction as a direct effect of the disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p><p>Rosen et al in their prospective cohort study with 55 pregnant women who had COVID-19 disease in the first and second trimesters; major anomalies in 2 fetuses were seen. In 1 case where the mother was infected with SARS-CoV2 at 8 weeks of gestation; anhydramnios and small echogenic kidneys were present and fetal blood sampling revealed no genetic abnormalities on chromosomal microarray testing. In another case, in a mother with mild symptomatic COVID-19 disease at the 15th gestational week, an isolated finding of unilateral fetal cataract was detected.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> With this, although it is shown that there are some abnormalities related to COVID-19; there is not any case report that shows the relation of COVID-19 with sirenomelia in the literature still.</p><p>For the reason of fetal malformation the medicine given should also be considered. In our case, 7 days of treatment with favipiravir (category X), levofloxacin (category C), enoxaparin sodium (category B), famotidine (category B), paracetamol (category B), budesonide (category B), dornaz alfa (category B), and vitamin C, were given to the patient and stopped 1 week before beta hCG positivity. In our country according to the health ministry data; more than 103,000 humans died due to COVID-19. COVID-19 causes morbidity as well as mortality. Our case was diagnosed with COVID-19 in June 2022 and the routine treatment of COVID-19 in our country at that date was the treatment administered to our patient. Now, the treatment approaches differ between the health centers. Favipiravir, an antiviral drug, is an RNA polymerase inhibitor and has been used for the treatment of COVID-19 disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Favipiravir use is contraindicated during pregnancy; the drug has a high risk for teratogenicity and embryotoxicity. A retrospective study done by Tirmik&#231;io&#287;lu et al with 29 women who were exposed to favipiravir during pregnancy resulted in 25 live births, 1 foramen ovale, and 2 preterm deliveries. The study indicated that 29 exposures occurred during the contraindicated time (from 7 days before conception and/or during the pregnancy). One of 25 live birth infants showed some minor congenital anomalies (patent foramen ovale); other than that there were no major congenital anomalies.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> In another study done by Ethem et al, favipiravir was indicated as not likely to be a teratogen since no major congenital anomalies were found in a retrospective study that covered up 1 year of admissions.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> In our case, the question is whether the malformation is related to COVID-19 infection or favipiravir usage. Since there are more reported congenital malformations caused by COVID-19 infection rather than favipiravir; we as the authors think that the sirenomelia seen in this fetus is most likely due to the result of COVID-19 infection. Although we as the authors linked the malformations to COVID-19; in the reproductive period the treatment prescribed should be reconsidered by teratogenicity as well by considering advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>In the literature, there is conflicting evidence about the impact of COVID-19 in pregnancy especially if the patient is confronted with the virus in the first trimester. Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID-19 in pregnancy, there are insufficient good quality unbiased studies about the issue. Risk factors for COVID-19 overlap with the risk factors for pregnancy complications and the risk factors of the treatment prescribed. The impact of COVID-19 exposure on neonatal outcomes has not yet been fully evaluated; by this article, we aim to find if COVID-19 exposure is linked to congenital anomalies. Further research is needed to ascertain neonatal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Erciyestepe Sezgi G&#252;ll&#252;, Pata &#214;zlem.</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Erciyestepe Sezgi G&#252;ll&#252;, Pata &#214;zlem.</p><p><bold>Resources:</bold> Erciyestepe Sezgi G&#252;ll&#252;.</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold> Pata &#214;zlem.</p><p><bold>Writing &#8211; original draft:</bold> Erciyestepe Sezgi G&#252;ll&#252;.</p><p><bold>Writing &#8211; review &amp; editing:</bold> Erciyestepe Sezgi G&#252;ll&#252;.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>
