Cannabinoid and terpene content, as well as microbial load, were evaluated at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks in EB-irradiated and non-irradiated samples. Microbial count in non-irradiated flowers reached up to 4.1 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/g; EB irradiation reduced these levels to &lt;10<sup>2</sup> CFU/g. Cannabinoid contents were unaffected by EB irradiation and remained stable throughout storage. Terpene content decreased by 8.4% immediately after irradiation, followed by further declines during storage, reaching 22.3% and 24.0% average losses in non-irradiated and EB-irradiated samples after 12 weeks, respectively. EB irradiation caused a higher decrease in monoterpenes (10.8%) than in sesquiterpenes (2.5%). These findings confirm that EB irradiation is an effective sterilization method for hemp flowers that preserves chemical integrity. Storage time also significantly reduced microbial loads in non-irradiated samples; TAMC in cultivar B declined from 20,728 CFU/g to &lt;LOQ (100 CFU/g), and TYMC decreased 16-fold. Cultivar A exhibited a sharp initial TAMC reduction followed by fluctuations and TYMC levels that were 7-fold lower by Week 12, reflecting natural microbial decay during hemp flower storage.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cannabinoids</kwd><kwd>cannabis</kwd><kwd>decontamination</kwd><kwd>electron beam irradiation</kwd><kwd>hemp</kwd><kwd>microbial safety</kwd><kwd>preservation</kwd><kwd>terpenes</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Puregene AG</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Puregene AG, a subsidiary of Pure Holding AG.

Introduction</title><p>Cannabis (<italic toggle="yes">Cannabis sativa</italic> L.) one of the oldest cultivated plants [<xref rid="B1-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] is valued for its diverse array of applications, including fiber, textiles, fuel, therapeutics, and pharmaceuticals [<xref rid="B2-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Owing to the history of global prohibition, cannabis has been broadly classified as either hemp, which is characterized by low &#916;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content and permitted for cultivation, or cannabis plants with higher THC levels that remain strictly regulated. The legal classification of hemp varies by jurisdiction. In the United States, hemp is defined as containing no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight [<xref rid="B5-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], whereas in Switzerland, the allowable THC limit can be as high as 1% [<xref rid="B6-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cannabis flower is the major source of the plant&#8217;s diverse array of phytochemicals, including cannabinoids, terpenes, and phenolic compounds, which contribute to its pharmacological and therapeutic properties. Hemp, in particular, serves as a rich source of cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid that is less abundant in high-THC cultivars [<xref rid="B7-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similar to the broad medical applications for high-THC medical cannabis, such as in treatments for chronic pain, inflammatory diseases, and chemotherapy-induced nausea [<xref rid="B10-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], hemp flower and CBD-rich extracts have been recognized for their therapeutic potential [<xref rid="B11-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Many studies have demonstrated the potential of CBD in alleviating pain [<xref rid="B12-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and anxiety [<xref rid="B16-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and in management of seizures associated with epilepsy [<xref rid="B17-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hemp and medical cannabis are primarily consumed by inhalation, either through vaporization or smoking of the dried flower [<xref rid="B18-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, during cultivation, processing, and packaging, hemp can become contaminated by pathogenic fungi such as yeasts and molds [<xref rid="B19-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which pose safety concerns, especially when inhaled [<xref rid="B20-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Previous studies have linked fungal contamination in cannabis products to serious health outcomes [<xref rid="B24-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], underscoring the need for improved microbial safety standards for hemp flower.</p><p>For medicinal cannabis, consumer safety concerns have led to regulations in Europe, Canada, and certain U.S. jurisdictions that mandate microbial load testing. Under Dutch regulations, medicinal cannabis must contain &lt;100 colony-forming units (CFUs) per gram, a threshold that approaches sterility [<xref rid="B29-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In contrast, Canada permits a higher limit of up to 1000 CFUs per gram. Furthermore, the European and United States Pharmacopoeias have set strict microbiological safety standards for inhalable cannabis products, requiring the complete absence of pathogens such as <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and bile-tolerant Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref rid="B19-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B30-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Notably, in the United States, the standards for both recreational and medical cannabis are inconsistent across states [<xref rid="B31-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Compared to this regulatory patchwork, microbial safety standards for hemp flower are even less consistent, often lacking clear oversight altogether, leaving hemp flower largely unregulated with respect to microbial load [<xref rid="B24-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, knowledge gaps remain regarding the impact of post-harvest treatments on flower quality and microbial load reduction, underscoring the need for studies to support evidence-based policymaking and standard-setting.</p><p>Given that maintaining sterile conditions in cannabis cultivation is both challenging and costly, effective post-harvest decontamination remains essential for consistently meeting safety requirements [<xref rid="B32-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Post-harvest treatment methods, such as electron beam (EB), cold plasma, and gamma irradiation, have been thoroughly reviewed for their effectiveness in reducing fungal contaminants in medical cannabis [<xref rid="B33-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Unlike gamma irradiation, EB technologies deliver ionizing radiation without relying on radioactive sources [<xref rid="B37-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], making it a safer and more accepted technology within the industry [<xref rid="B32-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While research has shown that EB irradiation can effectively sterilize cannabis flower, less is known about its impact on long-term storability, chemical integrity, and microbiological stability post-treatment [<xref rid="B36-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This method, widely used in food safety, effectively sterilizes food ingredients and extends product shelf life [<xref rid="B38-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], is regulated in the European Union, the United States, Australia, and Canada [<xref rid="B37-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>In addition to microbial safety, previous work has shown that the phytochemical composition of cannabis flowers changes during long-term storage. Cannabinoids such as &#916;9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) undergo slow decarboxylation to their neutral forms, while THC can oxidize to cannabinol (CBN) under exposure to heat, light, or oxygen, whereas CBD is comparatively stable [<xref rid="B7-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B30-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B39-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Terpenes are more vulnerable due to their volatility and susceptibility to oxidation; monoterpenes such as myrcene and limonene typically degrade more rapidly than sesquiterpenes, leading to measurable losses in aroma and quality over time [<xref rid="B30-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B36-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B39-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Although packaging in sealed or vacuum-protected containers minimizes volatilization and oxygen exposure, several studies report significant declines in total terpene content over months of storage [<xref rid="B30-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B39-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B41-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Recent work by Lumu et al. [<xref rid="B40-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] demonstrated that hemp flowers stored for six months at different moisture levels retained higher total cannabinoid content when stored at lower moisture, while CBD and &#916;9-THC levels remained statistically unchanged; however, elevated storage temperatures and light exposure accelerated cannabinoid decarboxylation [<xref rid="B40-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These chemical dynamics are increasingly recognized as critical for product quality and consumer experience, yet systematic data on the combined effects of irradiation and storage on hemp flower phytochemistry remain limited.</p><p>This study evaluated the impact of EB irradiation and storage time on cannabinoid and terpene profiles, as well as microbial loads in hemp inflorescences of 2 cultivars over a 12-week storage period. Specifically, this research assesses the suitability of EB irradiation for sterilization, focusing on its effectiveness in preserving the chemical stability and microbial safety of hemp flowers during extended storage. Moreover, the study provides insights into the stability of hemp-specific secondary metabolites during storage and shows that microbial load decreases over time under the tested storage conditions. These findings highlight a potential avenue for further research into consumer safety standards.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-30-03601"><title>2.

They are also consistent with findings from studies on maize seeds [<xref rid="B43-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and dried red pepper powder [<xref rid="B44-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], where EB irradiation effectively reduced the initial fungal microbial load. Irradiated samples representing both cultivars showed microbial counts below the limit of detection (&lt;100 &#177; 0 CFU/g) with no microbial recovery during storage, indicating sustained suppression of viability. The uniformity of microbial reduction underscores the ability of EB irradiation to reliably induce lethal damage to microbes, irrespective of initial contamination levels or storage duration, with no recovery observed over 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot2-molecules-30-03601"><title>2.1.2. Storage Time</title><p>Non-irradiated samples of both cultivars exhibited progressive declines in TAMC and TYMC over 12 weeks of storage, though with distinct patterns. For cultivar B, the TAMC decreased steadily from 20,728 CFU/g at Week 0 to &lt;LOQ (100 CFU/g) by Week 12, while the TYMC declined from 606,667 CFU/g to 37,100 CFU/g over the same period. In contrast, cultivar A showed a sharp initial decline in TAMC (301,961 CFU/g at Week 0 to 21,274 CFU/g at Week 8), with fluctuations at later time points. TYMC in cultivar A decreased steadily from 4,311,111 CFU/g (Week 0) to 632,222 CFU/g (Week 12), but residual counts remained substantially higher than in cultivar B (17-fold higher for TYMC at Week 12). Microbial populations (CFU/g) in dried plant materials experience decline during storage due to the stress conditions created by the drying process. Bacteria are confronted with stress environments such as high or low temperature, higher osmolarity, and acidic pH [<xref rid="B45-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. While spore cells may remain viable for months after drying, the overall microbial load decreases over time as vegetative cells are more susceptible to the low water activity conditions than bacterial spores or certain resistant fungi, leading to a gradual reduction in total viable counts during storage.

These findings highlight the efficacy of EB irradiation in reducing microbial contamination, especially fungal growth (TYMC) which was significantly reduced in both varieties, although its effect on aerobic bacteria (TAMC) varied by cultivar. Together, these results underline the importance of post-harvest treatments like EB irradiation for ensuring microbial safety in cannabis products. The influence of cultivar on TAMC may warrant further investigation, as differences in secondary metabolites, such as terpenes and cannabinoids with known antimicrobial properties, could contribute to variation [<xref rid="B46-molecules-30-03601" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-30-03601"><title>2.2.

Levels of CBDA showed minimal variation between irradiated and non-irradiated samples, indicating that EB irradiation had no significant impact on its concentration. Similarly, minor cannabinoids such as THC, THCA, cannabigerol (CBG), cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), and others were present in much smaller quantities and demonstrated negligible changes due to irradiation. Overall, the data suggest that the cannabinoid profile of cannabis flowers is highly stable with EB irradiation, with no substantial reductions observed for either major or minor cannabinoids in either cultivar.

The significant effects of E-beam irradiation and storage on total THC, CBC, and CBG&#8212;but not total cannabinoids or CBD&#8212;reflect inherent structural vulnerabilities in these minor compounds. THC&#8217;s susceptibility stems from its oxidizable phenolic hydroxyl and strained cyclohexene double bond. CBC&#8217;s instability arises from its conjugated diene system within the chromene ring. CBG&#8217;s heightened sensitivity is primarily driven by its linear, electron-rich geranyl chain, featuring reactive allylic positions and a vulnerable terminal isoprene unit prone to oxidation and electrophilic attack, combined with the inherent reactivity of its resorcinol core. Conversely, CBD&#8217;s stabilized resorcinol architecture within its pyran ring and the absence of highly reactive alkenes or exposed allylic systems in its core structure explain its resilience. Critically, the stability of total cannabinoids and CBD&#8212;the dominant commercial traits&#8212;validates irradiation as a decontamination method for high-CBD cultivars, despite cultivar-specific fluctuations in minor analogs.</p><p>Cultivar B exhibited greater resilience: irradiation alone caused no significant changes in any cannabinoid.

The stability of total cannabinoids and CBD&#8212;the dominant commercial traits&#8212;supports EB irradiation as a viable decontamination method for high-CBD cultivars. While minor cannabinoids (e.g., THC, CBC, CBG) showed cultivar-dependent degradation during storage, these changes do not compromise core product integrity. Cultivar A&#8217;s greater sensitivity in minor compounds highlights genetic influences on stability, urging cultivar-specific validation.

In stark contrast, Cultivar B exhibited profound irradiation sensitivity, with significant effects on total terpenes (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and nearly all individual compounds.

Cultivar A&#8217;s significant interactions indicate irradiation modified storage degradation kinetics&#8212;potentially through residual oxidative effects. Cultivar B&#8217;s limited interactions suggest its terpenes experienced immediate, irreversible damage from irradiation, leaving little substrate for time-dependent interactions.</p><p>In conclusion, the stark contrast in terpene stability between cultivars aligns primarily with compositional differences: Cultivar B&#8217;s higher initial terpene content (0.65% vs. 0.37% in Cultivar A) and monoterpene-dominant profile (e.g., myrcene: 45&#8211;48% vs. 11&#8211;13%) likely amplified its vulnerability. Volatile monoterpenes (e.g., myrcene, limonene) are inherently prone to degradation under EB irradiation and storage, explaining B&#8217;s significant effects. Cultivar A&#8217;s stability may arise from its lower terpene load and distinct profile, though biochemical factors (e.g., antioxidants) could potentially contribute. Critically, microbial burden (higher in A) did not predict stability, underscoring that composition&#8212;not contamination&#8212;drives degradation risk.

EB Irradiation Effect on Monoterpene and Sesquiterpene Content at Week 0</title><p>The immediate effect (Week 0) of EB irradiation on the content of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the two hemp cultivars is presented in <xref rid="molecules-30-03601-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>The data reveal that EB irradiation results in a reduction in terpene content, with monoterpenes being more significantly affected than sesquiterpenes. In cultivar A, the monoterpene content decreased from 0.25% in non-irradiated samples to 0.23% in irradiated samples, indicating a relative reduction of 10.3%. Similarly, in cultivar B, the monoterpene content dropped from 0.42% in non-irradiated samples to 0.37% in irradiated samples, representing an 11.2% relative decrease. For sesquiterpenes, the reduction in content was much smaller. In cultivar A, sesquiterpene content decreased by 2.2%, while in cultivar B, the reduction was around 2.7%. This greater reduction in monoterpenes is likely attributable to their higher volatility. The lower volatility of sesquiterpenes, which consist of three isoprene units, explains their relatively minor reduction compared to monoterpenes. These results suggest that the immediate impact of EB irradiation is primarily on the evaporation of monoterpenes due to their higher volatility. The minimal impact on sesquiterpenes underscores their greater stability under similar conditions. This suggests that the EB treatment&#8217;s effect on terpene content is limited to the initial period following irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-molecules-30-03601"><title>2.6. Effect of EB Irradiation &#215; Storage Time on Monoterpene-to-Sesquiterpene Ratio</title><p>EB irradiation caused an immediate reduction in the monoterpene-to-sesquiterpene ratio in both hemp cultivars (<xref rid="molecules-30-03601-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>At Week 0, the monoterpene-to-sesquiterpene ratio in cultivar A was 3.48 in non-irradiated samples and 3.19 in irradiated samples. Similarly, in cultivar B, the respective ratios were 2.29 and 2.09. This immediate reduction is consistent with the higher volatility of monoterpenes, which are more susceptible to degradation or evaporation following EB irradiation. Over time, both cultivars showed a gradual decline in the ratio for both irradiated and non-irradiated samples. In cultivar A, the ratio in non-irradiated samples decreased from 3.48 at Week 0 to 2.38 at Week 12, while the ratio in irradiated samples declined from 3.19 to 2.04 over the same period. In cultivar B, the ratio dropped from 2.29 to 1.92 in non-irradiated samples and from 2.09 to 1.83 in irradiated samples from Week 0 to Week 12. Interestingly, by Week 12, the difference in the monoterpene-to-sesquiterpene ratio between irradiated and non-irradiated samples diminished, suggesting that the initial effects of EB irradiation on terpene volatility even out over time. This convergence implies that while EB irradiation accelerates the initial loss of monoterpenes, the long-term degradation rates of both monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes become similar as the more volatile monoterpenes stabilize or reach equilibrium.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-molecules-30-03601"><title>2.7. Effects of EB Irradiation &#215; Storage Time on Relative Terpene Abundance</title><p><xref rid="molecules-30-03601-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the change in total terpene content across both cultivars as a function of both EB irradiation and storage time. The data are expressed as relative abundance of terpenes, which was calculated as a percentage of the initial terpene content (Week 0) reported in non-irradiated (control) samples (set at 100%).</p><p>The immediate 8.4% reduction following EB irradiation likely results from direct radiolytic effects, where high-energy electrons induce bond scission in terpene molecules, particularly affecting volatile monoterpenes through homolytic cleavage and formation of reactive intermediates. Over the 12-week storage period, both the non-irradiated and EB-irradiated samples exhibited a gradual decline in terpene content. This storage-related decrease could involve oxidative degradation, where residual oxygen reacts with terpene double bonds through autoxidation, although the samples were packed and stored in vacuum-sealed bags, which should minimize oxygen exposure and volatilization. Other possible degradation pathways may also contribute, such as hydrolysis or elimination reactions, even in dried samples. A notable exception occurred at Week 8 for the EB-irradiated samples, where an apparent increase was observed. However, this deviation is most likely attributable to the relatively large SD for that time point rather than a genuine increase in terpene content. By the end of the 12-week storage period, both non-irradiated and irradiated samples showed similar overall terpene losses (22.3% vs. 24.0%, respectively), indicating that EB irradiation does not substantially alter the chemical stability of the remaining terpene fraction or generate catalytic species that would accelerate subsequent degradation processes. The preservation of sesquiterpenes in both treatments supports this conclusion, as their lower volatility and reduced oxidation susceptibility contribute to overall profile stability during storage. These results suggest that while EB irradiation causes an initial reduction in some terpene levels, storage time exerts a more pronounced overall effect. The relatively small impact of EB irradiation on terpene stability indicates that this sterilization method is compatible with preserving terpene profiles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-molecules-30-03601"><title>3. Materials and Methods</title><p>Female plants from hemp cultivars A and B were cultivated under controlled glasshouse conditions in Weiningen, Switzerland, during the 2024 spring-summer season. Cuttings from genetically identical mother plants were rooted in a climate-controlled environment for 14 days at 26 &#176;C with 85% relative humidity and an 18 h photoperiod (18 h light/6 h dark). Light intensity was gradually increased from 100 to 300 &#181;mol&#183;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>&#183;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density) during this period. Once rooted, the cuttings were transplanted into 5 L pots filled with coco-peat substrate and moved to a vegetative room within the glasshouse. During the vegetative phase, the plants were maintained under an 18 h photoperiod, with temperatures averaging 28 &#176;C in the daytime and 25 &#176;C at night; relative humidity ranged between 70 and 85%. After 7 days, plants were transferred to flowering conditions for approximately 7 weeks, with the photoperiod adjusted to 12 h light/12 h dark to induce flowering. During the flowering phase, daytime and nighttime temperatures averaged 27 &#176;C and 23 &#176;C, respectively, and relative humidity was gradually decreased from 75% to 60%. Supplemental CO<sub>2</sub> was provided based on external radiation levels. Plants were irrigated using an ebb-and-flow system with a nutrient solution, where the electrical conductivity was progressively reduced from 1.8 dS&#183;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> to 1.0 dS&#183;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> throughout the flowering period. Supplemental lighting was used during both the vegetative and flowering phases when outdoor radiation was insufficient for optimal growth. Blackout screens were employed to regulate the photoperiod.</p><p>At the end of the flowering phase, the plants were manually harvested, with flowers carefully separated from the stems, trimmed, and freeze-dried. Water activity (a<sub>w</sub>) was not measured during storage; however, the flowers were dried to typical commercial moisture levels prior to packaging. Two kilograms of dried hemp flowers were then placed inside Mylar bags [3.5 mil (89 &#181;m) laminate of polyethylene terephthalate, aluminum foil, and polyethylene (PET/foil/PE)]. These multilayer bags are designed to provide a strong barrier against moisture and oxygen transmission and are widely used for long-term storage of dried botanicals. Irradiation was carried out by an industrial partner (Ionisos EB Services AG, D&#228;niken, Switzerland) as a tolling service. The processing conditions, using a high-energy (9.8 million electron Volts, 28 kW) linear accelerator-based electron beam system were: 120 cm scan width, single-pass configuration, conveyor speed of 3 m/min, and beam current of 1.86 mA. Detailed dose mapping data were not available to the authors. The speed of the conveyor belt was adjusted to deliver ca. 5 kGy dose to the material from the accelerator. After treatment, the plant material was packed into vacuum-sealed bags, each containing approximately 50 g of flower material. Packing was carried out in a sterile environment to prevent additional contamination. The bags were then placed along similarly packed non-irradiated flower material (controls) in a storage room maintained at 17&#8211;19 &#176;C with a relative humidity of around 50%.

Conclusions</title><p>EB irradiation was highly effective in reducing microbial loads in hemp, achieving levels far below current regulatory thresholds for medical cannabis immediately after treatment. Notably, non-irradiated samples also exhibited a significant decrease in microbial loads over the 12-week storage period, though they remained higher than those in the irradiated samples overall. As water activity (aw) was not monitored during storage, we cannot assess the observed microbial declines in the context of moisture conditions; future work should incorporate aw measurements alongside microbial counts to clarify this relationship. The chemical composition of quality-critical compounds, including cannabinoids and terpenes, was well-preserved, with minimal or no impact observed from EB irradiation treatment. In this study, CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids appeared unaffected by EB irradiation or subsequent storage, with no measurable changes observed in either irradiated or non-irradiated samples. EB irradiation immediately reduces the monoterpene-to-sesquiterpene ratio, likely because of the greater volatility of monoterpenes. However, there is no indication that the initial EB irradiation has any lasting impact on the natural degradation of terpenes over time. Regardless of whether samples received irradiation, increased storage time led to a reduction in total terpene content, underscoring the need for optimizing storage conditions and preservation methods to maintain hemp flower quality. Collectively, these findings support EB irradiation as a robust decontamination method and highlight storage duration as a promising post-harvest intervention, which warrants further exploration for optimizing microbial reduction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Gonzalo Villarino, of Puregene AG, for providing editorial support, and Kasia Lach-Falcone and Simon Goepfert, for their valuable input and guidance throughout this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
