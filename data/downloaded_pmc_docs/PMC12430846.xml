A pretested, semi-structured questionnaire was administered, and six key informant interviews were conducted.

We adopted the Donabedian model during the analysis and organized the codes under these major themes[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Access;[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Delivery of the Services;[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and Quality of Care.</p></sec><sec><title>Result:</title><p>Most pregnant women (81.9%, 95% CI = 75.2%&#8211;86.8%) sought care from both public and private healthcare facilities, however, they preferred public facilities for delivery (74.6%, 95% CI = 67.6%&#8211;80.4%). The qualitative analysis revealed three major themes[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Access;[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Delivery of the Services;[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and Quality of Care. Primary reasons for opting for private facilities included perceived superior ANC quality, organized care evident in scheduled appointments, reduced waiting time, frequent ultrasounds, personalized medication, and enhanced rapport with family. Women also believed that visits to government facilities are essential to avail the monetary benefits and have a seamless admission during delivery. They felt that government hospitals perform fewer cesarean sections.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Strengthening public-private partnerships could enhance antenatal care utilization, benefiting pregnant women and streamlining healthcare delivery.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Antenatal care</kwd><kwd>public and private health facilities</kwd><kwd>utilization pattern of antenatal care</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>It was funded by the JIPMER Intramural fund Nil.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>The current sustainable development goal (SDG) is to reduce the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Antenatal care (ANC) plays a vital role in reducing maternal mortality.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Essential ANC includes risk identification, prevention and management of pregnancy-related diseases, health education, and promotion. The percentage of expecting mothers, who had at least four ANC visits increased from 51.2% in NFHS-4 (2014&#8211;15) to 58.1% in NFHS-5 (2019&#8211;20).[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH) Programme by MoHFW (The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) recommends that every antenatal mother should receive at least four ANC checkups, iron-and-folic acid (IFA) tablets, calcium tablets, tetanus injections (TT), weight monitoring, blood pressure checks, abdominal examinations, and counseling from a frontline health worker.[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There is variation in ANC use; some pregnant women do not use it, while others visit multiple healthcare providers at multiple times.[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The behavior of seeking multiple healthcare facilities for ANC has not been studied. Understanding the proportion seeking such various care facilities and the reasons for such behavior will identify the gaps in the provision of quality care services. In addition, it adds to the out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) of antenatal women. Such healthcare spending during pregnancy and childbirth hinders access to high-quality treatment, particularly for low-income women.[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The current study aims to describe the dual use of public and private healthcare services for various components of ANC and understand the reasons for the dual utilization.

The public tertiary care center is usually crowded, and pregnant women must wait in a long line. In contrast, private healthcare facilities always respect patients&#8217; time and facilitate consultations by scheduling appointments in advance. Hence, private facilities had better accessibility to the time dimension. It was also noted that rich women prefer private health facilities. A comment by an AWW:</p><p><italic toggle="yes">&#8220;An advantage of a private hospital is there won&#8217;t be any crowd, and no need to wait for a longer time</italic>.&#8221; (<italic toggle="yes">52 years old, female, 30 years of work experience as an AWW)</italic></p><p>The conditional cash transfer schemes of the Government are additional motivators for pregnant women to register at PHCs and have at least four visits.

Key informants felt that women prefer public facilities for delivery because of the belief that cesarean section rates are low in government facilities. Hence, they availed ANC from the same public health facility. Few mothers also felt that doctors at government tertiary health centers are highly experienced.</p><p>

They also felt that the iron tables provided by the private practitioners were more palatable. Reports from private facility was also reviewed by the public health facility. It put the women at ease. In addition, mothers reported that using public facilities required them to navigate between different buildings, especially for investigations. Hence, preferring private facilities enabled them to receive services from one place. Another reason for visiting private hospitals is because of the availability of ultrasound scans and regular testing with immediate provision of reports. In this regard, a mother said:</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#8220;The only reason we visit a private hospital is to find out about the unborn child&#8217;s health. You can get a scan at a private hospital and find out how the baby is doing. The treatment could be improved.&#8221; (A 32 years old mother of two children)</italic>

Likewise, private hospitals schedule routine checkups within a specific period and notify patients in advance. Mothers consider their baby&#8217;s health more important than anything else. The interview divulged that the baby&#8217;s health took priority over spending money and they sought care privately irrespective of their financial status.</p><p>The key informants felt that seeking multiple healthcare facilities does not affect ANC. <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;There won&#8217;t be any difficulties or confusion (when they seek multiple facilities for antenatal care) because they show all the reports and results from where they took the first treatment.

Many of these private practitioners work in government hospital. For delivery, women go to Government hospital mostly the same hospital in which the private practitioner whom they consulted worked.

Public facilities were preferred for Td immunization and counseling services, while private facilities were chosen for undergoing ultrasound examinations and other lab investigations. The majority (74.6%) delivered at public hospitals. The qualitative analysis of the study revealed three major themes as reasons for availing ANC from multiple healthcare facilities[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]: Access,[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Service components, and[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Quality of Care.</p><p>In our study, many women sought ANC from multiple sources. A similar trend was observed in a study from a low-middle-income region in Brazil. Notably, Women seeking care from multiple healthcare facilities did not report any significant challenges for it. However, this practice leads to OOPEs, even though the amounts spent are relatively low. These indicate a clear need for fostering stronger public-private partnerships in the healthcare sector to improve the continuity of care.</p><p>Approximately, 71% underwent ultrasound scans in private health facilities was the major reason to seek private care in addition to their regular visits to primary health centers. This behavior was driven by their concerns about their child in the womb. On an average mothers underwent one to twelve scans during pregnancy, similar to that observed in a study from Kerala, India.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The implementation of a new recommendation of offering ultrasound services by trained persons in the Primary Health Centre under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) is a right move by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This will improve universal health coverage by decreasing unnecessary OOPEs. The private healthcare facilities were preferred by participants for IFA supplement consumption, mainly due to the perception of better taste.[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In our qualitative data analysis, pregnant women reported feeling more at ease and safe during private facilities checkups. They appreciated the convenience of comprehensive services in one location, thereby shortening the waiting time. Conversely, at tertiary-level public hospitals women faced the challenging of navigating different areas, insufficient waiting space, limited availability of certain services, and delays in provision of test results. Women increasingly seek compassionate, evidence-based care.[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Government facilities should prioritize empathy and address the unique needs of women with sensitivity. Under the LaQshya, respectful maternity care should be expanded to ANC.[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] There is a pressing need to enhance service quality, especially in providing empathetic care to antenatal women. This echoes a study in Uttar Pradesh, emphasizing the priority of user satisfaction in healthcare quality improvement projects.[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Our findings, consistent with a study using Swabhimaam project data, highlight that nutritional counseling during pregnancy primarily originates from Government healthcare personnel.[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This underscores the public sector&#8217;s superiority in preventive care. However, patients attending private facilities are less likely to receive essential nutritional counseling. Therefore, the program should focus on training and encouraging private providers to offer counselling on nutrition, contraception, danger signs, and birth preparedness.</p><p>According to qualitative results, the conditional maternity cash transfer schemes motivate some women to attend public facility[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] even though they prefer to use private healthcare facilities, resulting in multiple healthcare utilization. Pregnant women, who are eligible for support, are given financial aid and belong to lower socio-economic strata. However, visiting multiple facilities will incur additional costs, which differs from the program&#8217;s objective. A private-public partnership such as the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the Chiranjeevi Scheme in Gujarat would decrease OOPE and improve patient satisfaction.</p><p>The study&#8217;s strengths were the utilization of a pragmatic approach, integrative quantitative and qualitative results, and the inclusion of multiple stakeholders to give complete insight to policymakers and healthcare providers to improve healthcare services. The study&#8217;s applicability is limited to settings characterized by relatively favorable health indicators. The study had the limitation of not including the perspective of program managers and medical officers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Most mothers often seek ANC services from multiple facilities, leading to duplication and added expenses. To achieve universal health coverage, the government can establish public-private partnerships, regulating a mixed system of services. Incorporating a dedicated section in the mother and child protection card to record private facility services would prevent duplication and integrate complementary services. The private sector should prioritize health education for antenatal women and promote government facility utilization, especially among lower socio-economic groups.</p><sec><title>Ethics approval</title><p>Institute Ethics Committee approved the study (JIP/IEC/2021/157).
