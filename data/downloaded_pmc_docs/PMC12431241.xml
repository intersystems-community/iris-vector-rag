Given the critical period of neuroplasticity in the early stages of life, there is growing interest in investigating interventions starting in neonatal unit care that may improve outcomes for these infants [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Sensory-motor stimulation is a widely endorsed early intervention in neonatal care. It includes strategies designed to enhance neuropsychomotor development by providing multisensory stimuli (e.g., auditory, tactile, visual, vestibular) tailored to the infant&#8217;s functional development, gestational age, and weight [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Evidence suggests that such stimuli can improve various developmental outcomes, including behavioral organization, muscle tone, and weight gain, and can even shorten the length of hospitalization [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Gentle tactile interactions, particularly those provided by touching, can potentially improve the newborn&#8217;s experiences [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Affective touch has been linked to the activation of specific mechanoreceptors involved in modulating emotional and stress-regulatory pathways, which can potentially improve neonatal outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In fact, skin-to-skin contact&#8212;a core element of kangaroo care involving direct affective touch between the newborn&#8217;s skin and the caregiver&#8217;s bare skin&#8212;is recognized for multiple neonatal benefits. These include physiological stabilization, enhanced bonding, improved breastfeeding outcomes, better sleep and weight gain, reduced length of hospitalization, and overall improvements in infant health [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hence, skin-to-skin contact has become a global standard of neonatal care [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Interventions that encourage the newborn&#8217;s active movement and enhance mobility are also aligned with current recommendations, particularly in supporting neuromotor outcomes in at-risk infants [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Preterm infants often struggle with postural organization due to maturation-related hypotonia, which may lead to extensor muscle retractions, motor delays, and a reduced quality of spontaneous movements [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interventions that promote the maturation of a newborn&#8217;s flexor chain may stimulate the development of better body organization and, perhaps, enhance the quality of movements [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Despite the positive and potential effects of interventions for newborns, few studies have investigated their impact on the quality of early spontaneous movements. A particular type of spontaneous movement, the so-called general movements (GMs), have been recognized as a reliable biomarker of brain function [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These movements, involving variable activity of all body parts, are present from early fetal life and gradually disappear by 16&#8211;20 weeks post-term as intentional movements begin to predominate. GMs are generated endogenously by central pattern generators (CPG) and modulated by supraspinal projections and sensory feedback. Hence, the quality of GMs expresses the young nervous system functioning [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Randomized controlled trials have provided mixed results on the effects of early interventions on GMs [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A parent-administered motor intervention before term age did not affect the quality of GMs at 3&#8211;4 months post-term compared to standard care [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, a daily 90-minute structured multisensory intervention until discharge was effective in reducing the proportion of poor repertoire GMs compared to standard care [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. When a multimodal intervention was continued by parents at home after hospital discharge, the GMs rate was significantly higher compared to controls [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Sensory-motor stimulation, which encourages tailored sensory experiences for newborns, is thought to support the development of neural pathways [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which could ultimately improve GMs.</p><p>Although there is a growing body of literature that recommends sensory-motor interventions in neonatal care [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the specific effects of these practices on sensitive markers of neurological function, such as GMs, remain underexplored. Additionally, given the contrasting results of the existing literature on this topic [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], further investigation is crucial to provide clinically relevant insights into the impact of early sensory-motor interventions on neuromotor outcomes in preterm newborns. Further research is also warranted, as physical therapists commonly employ a range of techniques with preterm newborns based on sensory-motor principles. This study aimed to examine the short- and medium-term effects of a sensory-motor physical therapy intervention combined with kangaroo skin-to-skin contact, in comparison to skin-to-skin contact alone, on the GMs of preterm newborns in a neonatal setting. Additionally, considering the relevance of strengthening the evidence base supporting early interventions in neonatal clinical practice, the secondary objectives included exploring the effects of the intervention on weight gain, posture and muscle tone, behavioral state, length of hospital stay, and the establishment and maintenance of breastfeeding. The intervention would be considered beneficial if infants in the treatment group demonstrated superior GMs quality or, secondarily, greater weight gain, improved scores for posture and muscle tone, reduced hospital stay, and higher proportions of sleep state and breastfeeding compared to controls. The findings provide new exploratory insights to shed light on clinical decision-making and future larger trials on the influence of sensory-motor experiences on early motor behaviors and clinical outcomes in preterm newborns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Study design and trial registration</title><p>This is a parallel-group trial with two arms.

GMs involve coordinated movements of the upper and lower limbs, neck, and trunk, in a variable sequence. They are classified into age-specific categories: (a) fetal and preterm movements, occurring from the fetal period up to 37 weeks of postmenstrual age; (b) writhing movements (WMs), from 38 to 40 weeks of postmenstrual age until 8 weeks post-term; and (c) fidgety movements (FMs), which are observed from the 9<sup>th</sup> to the 20<sup>th</sup> post-term week. Normal WMs are characterized by small to moderate amplitudes, low to moderate velocity, occurring elliptically and giving the appearance of graceful contortions. Abnormal preterm and WMs are classified as: poor repertoire (PR), which consists of monotonous motor patterns with limited variability; cramped-synchronized (CS), when limb and trunk muscles contract and relax simultaneously without the fluidity of normal patterns; and chaotic (Ch), which involves high-amplitude movements that lack the smoothness and coordination of regular motor patterns. Normal FMs are small amplitude, moderate velocity movements of the limbs, trunk, and head, with variable acceleration and rotational movements of the hands and feet. Aberrant FMs include absent FMs (no or sporadic fidgety movements) and abnormally exaggerated FMs (marked by increased amplitude and velocity, and loss of continuity in the movements). Therefore, the GM quality categories include Normal, PR, CS, Ch, absent/sporadic FMs, and abnormal FMs [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>During hospitalization, GMs were recorded using a cell phone following Prechtl&#8217;s GMA standards, with the newborns placed in the supine position, dressed only in a diaper or bodysuit, without pacifiers or exposure to physical/verbal interaction. Video recordings lasted 3&#8211;5 minutes and were conducted by the same researcher at two time points: (I) the day before the start of the interventions (34&#8211;35 weeks of postmenstrual age), and (II) one day after the interventions&#8217; conclusion (day 16, around 36&#8211;37 weeks of postmenstrual age). After discharge, parents recorded GMs using a cell phone application at two additional time points: (I) 2&#8211;4 weeks post-term (WMs), and (II) 12&#8211;15 weeks post-term (FMs). Parents received prior instructions from the researcher on how to record GMs at home.

Overall, all newborns showed weight gain during the protocol and maintained their vital signs within normal and stable parameters. Additionally, no signs of respiratory and behavioral distress or evident adverse effects were observed. Therefore, based on these outcomes, the intervention was clinically safe.</p><p>On the other hand, although the proposed handling techniques were intended to facilitate the newborns&#8217; spontaneous movements, no treatment effects on the quality of GMs were found. This is in line with the results by Fj&#248;rtoft et al. [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], in which a parent-administered motor intervention between 34&#8211;37 postmenstrual weeks was insufficient to change the quality of FMs compared to standard care. In the study by Ma et al. [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], preterm newborns who underwent early multisensory intervention during hospitalization and after discharge showed no improvements in GMs in the WM age, but improvements in the FMs, compared to routine care. On the other hand, Khurana et al. [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] found a decreased proportion of newborns with poor repertoire GMs more in the neonatal physical therapy group, who received approximately 17 sessions of multisensory intervention for 90 minutes/day, 6 days/week until discharge, than in the routine care group. This suggests that a longer duration of intervention, potentially extended beyond the immediate post-discharge period, may be necessary to achieve more substantial effects on GMs. In our study, the newborns received the intervention across 10 sessions before discharge. Therefore, it is possible that a higher dose, either more frequent sessions prior to discharge [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], or longer duration, such as the continuation of the intervention post-discharge [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], might have produced different outcomes in GMs in this study. Previous research indicates that interventions initiated in the neonatal unit and extended into the home environment, particularly those involving active parental engagement, are associated with the most substantial improvements in early motor and cognitive outcomes before 12 months of age [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Besides a limited duration of the intervention, other possible explanations for the lack of intervention effects on the GMs could include mechanisms of neuroplasticity in preterm newborns and the intrinsic variability in GMs. To produce motor variability, supraspinal projections activate, inhibit, and modulate CPG activity, as well as the sensory feedback from the spontaneous movement itself [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In brain injury, the modulation of CPG by these projections results in less variable and abnormal movement [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, almost 90% of our total sample progressed to the presence of FMs, which suggests a normal outcome and a low risk of brain injury. Given the clinical stability of the newborns, with no presence of important neurological risk factors such as grade III or IV peri-intraventricular hemorrhages, we suggest that the intrinsic neuroplastic capacity and the endogenous developmental processes of the brain, even in an immature nervous system in the challenging extra-uterine environment, were sufficient to allow for favorable GM development, regardless of the intervention. Moreover, even under stable conditions, GMs&#8217; variability can fluctuate within and across days, which reflects normal neurodevelopmental processes and ongoing neural reorganization [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This natural intrinsic variability might have masked potential subtle intervention effects, particularly considering the short duration of our intervention. This reinforces that future studies should extend our proposed intervention for the home setting, after discharge.</p><p>On the other hand, we found treatment effects for two patterns of muscle tone (leg recoil and popliteal angle). This suggests that the sensory-motor intervention associated with skin-to-skin contact was better at improving the physiological flexor tone of the lower limbs than skin-to-skin contact alone. Previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] have demonstrated that sensory-motor interventions have beneficial effects on neuromuscular development in preterm newborns when assessed using tools based on Dubowitz et al. [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. According to Amiel-Tison [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the preterm flexor tone in the limbs observed in the popliteal angle begins 4&#8211;6 weeks earlier in the legs than in the arms, and leg recoil is detected 2&#8211;3 weeks earlier than arm recoil. This might explain why changes were not observed in the upper limb patterns. We suggest that the intervention benefited the caudocephalad tonus maturation expected in typical development. The newborns likely benefited from the body handling, midline postures, and enriched opportunities to perform spontaneous body movements, which might have facilitated the physiological tonus development.</p><p>The fact that all newborns in the study received kangaroo skin-to-skin contact may have contributed to equalizing the groups in terms of weight gain, hospitalization duration, breastfeeding outcomes, and, perhaps, even GMs. There is wide evidence that preterm newborns who undergo skin-to-skin contact tend to have shorter hospital stays [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and better breastfeeding both at hospital discharge and post-discharge [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Skin-to-skin contact has also been associated with better weight gain in low birthweight preterm newborns [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Recent research has shed light on the neurobiological mechanisms through which skin-to-skin contact benefits preterm newborns, particularly highlighting the role of C-tactile fibers &#8211; mechanoreceptors activated by gentle, affective touch. They are hypothesized to play a central role in modulating stress responses and promoting caregiver-newborn bonding, which supports their physiological stability. This may further benefit clinical outcomes and early neurodevelopment [<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332269.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The present study adds to the body of evidence supporting skin-to-skin contact as a core element of kangaroo mother care, even within standard neonatal practices. This can motivate future research to clarify the relationship between affective touch during skin-to-skin contact and early clinical and neuromotor outcomes.</p><p>We acknowledge the limitations of this study. First, the results may not be generalizable to other populations of preterm newborns with different clinical characteristics or other hospital settings. Moreover, it was not possible to control for interventions such as diet or medication use. We also acknowledge that additional potential confounding factors, such as maternal involvement, breastfeeding practices, and maternal stress level, were not controlled for, despite their possible influence on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Another limitation was the lack of blinding of the examiner to group allocation when assessing posture and muscle tone, and behavioral state, which increased the risk of bias in the evaluation of these variables. Therefore, the findings related to these outcomes should be interpreted with caution. Caution is also advised when interpreting the p-values associated with multiple testing, as observed for posture and muscle tone. Additionally, although a sample size calculation was adhered to, the number of participants can be considered small. In light of these limitations, alongside the clinical relevance and the potential yet non-confirmatory nature of the findings, this research should be regarded as a pilot study. Future trials should include a larger cohort to enhance both the internal and external validity of the findings. Despite these limitations, by mimicking an intervention adopted in the clinical practice of physical therapists, this study provides new insights for evidence-based neonatal intervention practice.</p><sec id="sec028"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Ten sessions of 15-minute sensory-motor intervention associated with 60-minute skin-to-skin contact over 15 days can be recommended for newborns at 34&#8211;35 weeks postmenstrual age and with an average initial weight of 1700 grams if the goal is to favor the muscle tone in the lower limbs. However, we do not recommend the intervention if the sole therapeutic objectives are to improve the newborns&#8217; quality of GMs, body weight gain, and breastfeeding, or reduce the length of hospitalization, as these outcomes can also be achieved by receiving skin-to-skin contact alone within routine hospital care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec029"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The sensory-motor intervention combined with kangaroo skin-to-skin contact was a clinically safe technique for stable preterm newborns, as no adverse effects were observed, and vital signs and clinical outcomes remained favorable.

A confirmatory larger trial is needed to further examine these neuromotor findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec030" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting
