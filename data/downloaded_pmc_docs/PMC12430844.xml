Monitoring adverse events post-licensure is equally critical to identify infrequent adverse events due to the vaccine product. Therefore, the Indian immunization program has established a nationwide adverse event following immunization (AEFI) surveillance program.</p><p>The fact that vaccines are generally given to healthy people decreases the threshold for tolerance of adverse events: an incidence of only 1:100 000 may be acceptable for vaccines, whereas, for adverse reactions to drugs, an incidence as high as 1:1&#8211;1:100 may be accepted.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Adverse media coverage may influence vaccine confidence, and affect the reputation of the immunization program and vaccine acceptance in the community. Hence, immediate attention to suspected AEFI for timely reporting followed by appropriate and detailed investigation and follow-up action are essential. Accurate and timely documentation of data is imperative for establishing causality between vaccination and suspected adverse events. With inadequate and incomplete data, an AEFI can only be deemed unclassifiable.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Such cases may become the focus of increased community concerns about vaccine safety.</p><p>This study was thus undertaken to gain practical insights into difficulties faced by healthcare workers and stakeholders involved in AEFI surveillance in the city and to understand team dynamics and implications of intersectoral collaboration among stakeholders from various departments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in a metropolitan city in Maharashtra during the period of January 2017-June 2018.

Each FGD lasted for a period of 45 minutes to 1 hour. FGDs were conducted by the investigator. A note-taking form was used for all FGDs, which were completed by a separate Notetaker. Non-verbal cues were also noted. On completion of the FGD, the investigator and note-taker discussed the findings of the FGD.</p><p>The first FGD was conducted with the FGD guide as the base. Data obtained were transcribed and analyzed using the inductive method. The findings of FGD were discussed among the research team. Modifications were made in the topic guide as per the need. Data collection and analysis followed an iterative process of reading, analyzing, correcting, and collecting further data. The process continued till data saturation was reached. The point of data saturation was considered as the point when the data collected did not add anything new to the understanding of the research topic. Data saturation was reached in four FGDs.</p><p>Transcripts were prepared on the basis of the notes of FGD. Coding of all relevant data was done by inductive method.

Some of these findings were similar to the findings of the present study.</p><p>During the study, it was found that both active and passive surveillance were being followed in the study area. The healthcare workers including ANMs and CHVs conducted home visits of all beneficiaries within 2-3 days post immunization. This active component of AEFI surveillance not only improved reporting rates but also helped in the early detection and management of adverse events. However, during the FGDs, it was noted that this increased the burden of work on the already exhausted healthcare workers in view of the multiple activities under various health programs. Hence, some of the recommendations included increasing the workforce by increasing the number of CHVs and providing incentives to them for timely reporting of AEFI. In a study conducted by Lankinen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] in Europe, it was stated that an increase in the number of staff was justified on the basis of the increasing number of incoming AEFI reports, vaccine scares, and evolving public health concerns.</p><p>During the discussion, some of the participants also expressed the fear of being blamed for the adverse event as a barrier to efficient reporting and management. Most of the healthcare professionals, especially the ones at the grassroots level, feared the response of the community towards them. The healthcare workers also feared being blamed by their superiors for poor quality of care. Similar concerns were raised by participants in studies conducted by Justin J Warring[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Parrella <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In this study, it was also noted training of health care professionals empowered them to face difficult situations boldly. Muehlhans <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] a study conducted in Russia and Germany, concluded that there was a significant association between formal vaccine safety training and AEFI reporting (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Similarly, in a study conducted by Alicino <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in Liguria Region, Italy, it was stated that after the implementation of educational activities in 2013, the reporting rate was estimated to increase from 1.7 reported AEFI for 100 000 administered doses of vaccine to approximately 14.0 for 100 000 administered doses.</p><p>In the present study, it was stated that supportive supervision of grassroots-level workers also improved the efficiency of work and thereby had a direct bearing on reporting. Similar suggestions were made by Joshi <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] in their study on AEFI surveillance in India. During the discussions, it was also stated that feedback on causality assessment if provided to grass root level workers would also help allay the fears and gain confidence. This gap was also identified in a study conducted in Italy wherein it was found that feedback to rapporteurs was provided in 13 countries and its quality was variable.[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] A study in Zimbabwe concluded that 47.1% of the study subjects did not get any feedback during the AEFI investigation.[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>According to the Annual Report on Child Health programs 2017-2018, AEFI surveillance job aids for Health workers and Medical Officers had been developed in English and Hindi and shared with some States for dissemination. Some states like Maharashtra and Gujarat have translated job aids into local languages too.[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Communication tools such as Communication Guidelines for health workers had been designed to assist them in interacting confidently with the community about AEFI. Simultaneous efforts have been made to build the capacity of policymakers for timely responses to the media about AEFI by providing guidance in the form of a Media Response Protocol.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>It was estimated that almost 20&#8211;30% of pediatric and most adult immunizations were administered in the private sector, particularly in urban areas.[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Moreover, vaccines not part of the Universal Immunization Program were provided by the private sector only. Hence, it was imperative that AEFIs from this sector were also reported and investigated as per national guidelines. Additionally, AEFI reporting from the private sector provided vital information on the safety of newer and underutilized vaccines in India. This concern was highlighted in the meeting of the WHO Global Vaccine Safety Initiative in Delhi in 2013 and a new CIOMS Working Groupon Vaccine Safety was established to address the gaps in collaborating mechanisms between the public and private sectors.[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>It was found that no proper training was conducted for private pediatricians. Moreover, the unregulated sector comprising general practitioners substantially contributed to this gap in reporting which required immense sensitization and training. A paper published by members of the IAP Advisory Committee on Vaccines and Immunization Practices indicated that apprehensiveness and lack of awareness about the existing AEFI reporting system contributed towards the decreased reporting rates in the private sector.[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In this study, during the group discussions, participants suggested that there had been attempts to bridge this gap by conducting special meetings with private practitioners, pediatricians, and MCI members. Some of the recommendations that evolved during the discussion included mandatory training of all private practitioners conducting immunizations, CHVs to work in collaboration with private doctors for active surveillance of AEFI, online reporting to be made available for easy reporting and stringent rules for availability of limited vaccines in the private sector.</p><p>Similar recommendations were given by members of the IAP Advisory Committee in their paper published in 2013. According to them, providing an online platform for private practitioners to report from the comfort of their clinics could improve reporting rates. They also recommended the integration of the IAP disease surveillance project with AEFI reporting for web-based and IVR reporting, which could further be integrated with SMS reporting.[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, this partnership of IAP with the National AEFI Surveillance system for establishing a web-based reporting system for its members could not be established to the expected extent.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Singh <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] stated that the AEFI surveillance program in India faced many limitations including under-reporting, poor documentation of reported cases and lack of exact denominators. These findings were similar to the findings of studies conducted in other parts of the world.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, despite these shortcomings, surveillance systems did provide useful information on emerging trends in vaccinovigilance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The AEFI surveillance program of the Immunization Division was assessed by the WHO as part of the Indian National Regulatory Authority (NRA) Assessment in 2017.
