Studies in animals and humans investigating the effect of fructose on MASLD present conflicting findings, while in vitro methods often fail to add meaningful evidence due to acute exposures (&lt;72 h) and non-physiological concentrations. This study aimed to determine the effect of fructose on triglyceride (TG) accumulation in HepG2 cells following acute and chronic exposures and assess its effect on the expression of genes related to de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Methods: TG concentration was measured after 48 h in response to fructose (20 mM) or glucose (20 mM), with or without a fatty acid mixture (oleic acid/palmitic acid 110 &#181;M/55 &#181;M), in low (5.5 mM)- and high (25.5 mM)-glucose media. To model chronic exposure, cells were maintained in fructose, glucose, or fatty acids for 28 days and the TG concentration was determined every 7 days. The effect of fructose on DNL regulators (<italic toggle="yes">SREBPF1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NR1H3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FASN</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">ACACA</italic>) was determined using qPCR. Results: Neither fructose nor glucose, with or without fatty acids, changed the TG levels in cells at 48 h and the media glucose concentration had no effect on this result. Similarly, fructose did not increase TG levels after 28 days. While fructose and glucose did not affect key DNL genes at 6 h, the fatty acid mixture reduced <italic toggle="yes">FASN</italic> by 41%. Conclusions: This study shows that fructose did not significantly impact TG synthesis or DNL gene expression in the HepG2 cell model.

Introduction</title><p>Metabolic (dysfunction)-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, is prevalent in 30% of the global population [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. MASLD is diagnosed when there is evidence of hepatic steatosis (lipid accumulation) alongside at least one cardiometabolic risk factor. Risk factors for MASLD include genetic predisposition, metabolic health, and dietary choices [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In liver cells, the accumulation of highly saturated triglycerides rich in palmitic acid and stearic acid is a hallmark of MASLD and contributes to lipotoxicity, leading to fibrogenesis, inflammation, and cell death [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Fructose, specifically, has been investigated extensively as a dietary contributor since it was first noted by Plini the Elder that feeding geese with dried figs increased the size of their liver [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This association resurfaced when high-fructose, but not high-glucose, sweetened beverages were reported to increase hepatic lipogenesis in adults [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Meta-analyses provided a less clear picture where fructose only increased intra-hepatic lipid content when consumed in excess of 100 g/day [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], while evidence in rodent models implicated fructose as a potent lipogenic substrate [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, principle component analyses of transcriptomes comparing human and rodent livers showed that they clustered by species (rodent or human) rather than liver state (steatotic or healthy) [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Conclusions from rodent models that poorly resemble human disease progression should therefore be interpreted with caution. Mechanistically, fructose is proposed to upregulate triglyceride (TG) levels in hepatocytes by either the products of fructose metabolism acting as direct substrates for de novo lipogenesis (DNL), or by fructose itself upregulating key transcription factors and enzymes involved in DNL (for a review, see Herman and Samuel 2016) [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The HepG2, human hepatocellular carcinoma, cell line is used in 76% of in vitro studies using hepatic cells and has a relatively high sequence homology with hepatocytes from liver tissue (80&#8211;82%) [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this cell line, the association between fructose and steatosis is not consistent: some studies report concentration- and time-dependent increases in TG accumulation when exposed to fructose [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], while other groups report no changes in TG levels [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Methodological differences may account for such discrepancies, yet key factors such as the glucose concentration in the culture media are often not controlled. Additionally, the maximum exposure period of 72 h does not model how fructose is consumed as part of a typical diet, that is, multiple times a day for years.</p><p>This study therefore aimed to perform tightly controlled experiments to determine the effect of fructose on TG accumulation in HepG2 cells under both acute (48 h) and chronic (28 d) exposure. Furthermore, the experiments were performed in high- and low-glucose media with and without fatty acids. Additionally, the effect of fructose on selected transcription factors and enzymes related to DNL was determined.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-17-02762"><title>2.

Ensuring Fatty Acid Concentrations Were Not Toxic</title><p>High concentrations of free fatty acids including oleic acid and palmitic acid, a combination regularly used as a positive control in TG accumulation assays, can be cytotoxic in cultured hepatocytes, even at 660/330 &#181;M [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To ensure that the fatty acid concentrations used as a positive control in experiments were non-toxic, cell viability was determined after 72 h. Specifically, HepG2 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-conjugated oleic acid, palmitic acid, or a combination of both. BSA-conjugated standards of oleic acid and palmitic acid were prepared in 0.1 N NaOH and heated at 70 &#176;C for 1 h. Once dissolved, the standards were diluted 1:2 in 10% BSA solution and gently rocked at 37 &#176;C for 10 min to conjugate. Final concentrations were 120 mM oleic acid and 40 mM palmitic acid in 5% BSA, and aliquots were stored at &#8722;20 &#176;C until use. HepG2 cells grown in low-glucose DMEM were plated at 3.5 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h to adhere. Cells were then exposed to vehicle (0.01% BSA/0.11 mM NaOH), or a 2:1 combination of oleic acid/palmitic acid (1.5 &#956;M&#8211;3 mM) for 72 h. The SRB assay was then performed to determine cell viability [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The combination of 110 &#181;M oleic acid and 55 &#181;M oleic acid (i.e., 165 &#181;M combined fatty acids) was the highest concentration that did not reduce cell number at 72 h (<xref rid="app1-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>) and was thus used as a positive control for all subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-nutrients-17-02762"><title>2.4. TG Assay</title><p>HepG2 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 3.5 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in low-glucose DMEM and left for 24 h to adhere. Wells were then treated with the indicated concentrations of fructose and incubated for 72 h. Cell harvesting and sample processing to determine the TG concentration was modified from a previous method [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Following incubation, the culture media were aspirated, and cells were washed with PBS. Cells were detached using a scraper and suspended on ice in 5% NP-40. Samples were then briefly sonicated (30% ampule; 21 s on, 10 s off) before centrifugation at 20,817&#215; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 8 min. The protein content of each sample was then determined using a Pierce<sup>TM</sup> BCA protein assay kit with a BSA standard curve. Samples were then heated twice to 90 &#176;C for 3 min and stored at &#8722;20 &#176;C for at least 24 h. To determine the TG concentration, samples were thawed to room temperature and mixed by manually pipetting samples up and down and then vortexed. Next, 10 &#181;L of each sample was added to a 96-well plate and incubated with 150 &#181;L of the Infinity triglyceride reagent for 10 min at 37 &#176;C. The absorbance at 510 nm was read using a Bio-Rad Benchmark Plus&#8482; microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Strategy, Auckland, New Zealand) and used to determine the TG concentration relative to a TG standard curve. The TG standard curve was prepared at 0, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 172 mg/dL. A representative correlation coefficient was 0.9979 with a regression equation of TG (mg/dL) = (absorbance at 510 nm &#8722; 0.02255)/0.004875. Concentrations were normalised to total cell protein which was determined relative to a BSA standard curve. The BSA standard curve used BSA concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, and 500 &#181;g/mL. A representative correlation coefficient was 0.9894 with a regression equation of BSA (&#181;g/mL) = (absorbance at 562 nm &#8722; 0.01577)/0.0007929.

To investigate what effect this has on TG accumulation in response to fructose exposure, HepG2 cells cultured in low (5.5 mM)- or high (25.5 mM)-glucose DMEM were seeded in 6-well plates at 5 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well and incubated for 24 h to allow cells to adhere. Cells were then treated with fructose (20 mM), glucose (20 mM), a combination of fatty acids (110 &#181;M oleic acid, 55 &#181;M palmitic acid), fructose + fatty acids, or glucose + fatty acids. After 48 h, cell lysates were harvested, and the TG concentration was determined.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-nutrients-17-02762"><title>2.6. Nile Red Assay</title><p>The fluorescent dye Nile red (9-diethylamino-5H-benzo[alpha]phenoxazine-5-one) binds to neutral lipid droplets and was used to confirm the results from the TG assay. HepG2 cells plated in low (5.5 mM)- or high (25.5 mM)-glucose DMEM at 3 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in black-walled 96-well plates were left to adhere for 24 h and then treated for 48 h. Media were then aspirated and cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Nile red (10 &#181;M) for 15 min at 37 &#176;C, protected from light. The plate was then washed three times with PBS. The relative fluorescent units were determined with excitation set at 488 nm and emission set at 565 nm, using a SpectraMax i3x multi-mode microplate reader (Bio-Strategy, Auckland, New Zealand).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-nutrients-17-02762"><title>2.7. Chronic Fructose Exposure</title><p>Acute exposure to fructose for up to 72 h is a common protocol to determine the effect on TG accumulation, yet fructose is consumed by most of the population multiple times a day, for years at a time. To address this, a chronic exposure model was developed. HepG2 cells were maintained and passaged in low-glucose DMEM supplemented with vehicle (0.01% BSA/0.11 mM NaOH), fructose (20 mM), glucose (20 mM), or a combination of fatty acids (110 &#181;M oleic acid, 55 &#181;M palmitic acid) for 28 days. At days 7, 14, 21, and 28, cells from each condition were plated at 1 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well in 6-well plates and left to adhere for 24 h. Cell lysates were then harvested, and the TG concentration was determined. Each treatment flask was passaged every two to three days and cell confluency &lt;80% was maintained. Low-passage cells were used over the 28-day exposure (P5-17). Cell morphology was also monitored every two to three days as an indicator of cell health, and a change in morphology was only detected in the fatty acid group due to lipid droplet accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot8-nutrients-17-02762"><title>2.8. qPCR</title><p>TG synthesis and breakdown is tightly regulated in cells [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], meaning transient changes in gene expression related to DNL may be missed in assays that determined TG accumulation in cells after 24 h. Therefore, qPCR was used to determine the expression level of key DNL genes following 6 h exposure. HepG2 cells in low-glucose DMEM were plated in 10 cm Petri dishes at 2 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/dish and incubated for 24 h to allow cells to adhere.

Effect of Fructose on TG and Lipid Accumulation</title><p>To determine the effect of varying concentrations of fructose on TG concentrations, HepG2 cells were exposed to a range of fructose concentrations for 72 h. The TG concentration as a percentage of total protein in cell lysates was significantly reduced by 28.2% at 50 mM and 38% at 80 mM compared to the vehicle control, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (<xref rid="nutrients-17-02762-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

No changes in TG content were observed, regardless of the background media glucose concentration or experimental fructose or glucose exposure (<xref rid="nutrients-17-02762-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a,b). Additionally, to determine if fructose could indirectly upregulate lipogenesis, cells were exposed to fructose in the presence of a fatty acid mixture. The fatty acid combination alone increased the TG concentration in cell lysates by 2.4-fold in cells cultured in low-glucose DMEM and 2.1-fold in those cultured in high-glucose DMEM, and the addition of fructose or glucose did not change this effect (<xref rid="nutrients-17-02762-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a,b). Furthermore, there was no change in cell viability compared to the vehicle following any treatment combination (<xref rid="app1-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S3a,b</xref>).</p><p>The Infinity triglyceride reagent assay uses a series of enzyme-coupled reactions to detect TGs in intracellular lipid droplets.

However, the experimental protocol could detect changes, as the fatty acid combination increased the Nile red intensity in the low-glucose group by 206% (<xref rid="nutrients-17-02762-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c) and in the high-glucose group by 280% (<xref rid="nutrients-17-02762-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>d).

Discussion</title><p>The effects of fructose on TG accumulation in liver cells is a common research question that has been addressed with a wide range of methods. Systemic fructose is maintained between 5 and 400 &#181;M [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and can increase to millimolar concentrations post-prandially [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The concentration of fructose detected in the systemic circulation is the best estimate for the concentration that the liver is exposed to, as sampling of portal vein blood is not easy to perform [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Reports of post-prandial plasma fructose concentrations vary between studies with most findings in the range of 1&#8211;3 mM [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], while one study reported a concentration of 17 mM [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the current study, this range of concentrations was examined, as well as concentrations up to 80 mM, and an interesting negative correlation between fructose concentration and TG accumulation occurred. Similar in vitro studies investigating the effect of fructose in TG and lipid accumulation have treated HepG2 cells with fructose concentrations between 5 and 20 mM. Comparison of results obtained in the current study to these papers is interesting as comparable methods to determine TG concentrations were used, and similar changes in response to positive controls were reported. Yet the response to fructose varied between the studies.</p><p>In a study by Lanaspa et al. (2012), a maximum response was detected at 20 mM fructose with a 2.1-fold increase in TGs compared to the vehicle control value of 60 mg/g of soluble protein [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While the same concentration of fructose did not cause such a change in the concentration of TGs in the current study, the control TG concentration was comparable (83 mg/g compared to 60 mg/g). Yu et al. (2018) studied a similar range of fructose concentrations (1, 5, and 20 mM) and observed a time- and concentration-dependent increase in TGs using a commercial enzyme-based assay across 12, 24, 48, and 72 h [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The TG concentration increased 2-fold at 72 h, similar to results from Lanaspa et al. (2012) [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], compared to the vehicle control value of approximately 70 mg/g of soluble protein. Lanaspa et al. (2012) [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Yu et al. (2018) [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] standardised the TG concentration to the total protein concentration in the cell lysates, an approach taken in the current study, and this accounts for changes in cell number in response to sugars. Yu et al. (2018) [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] also reported that the positive control used, palmitic acid (200 &#181;M), increased the TG concentration 2-fold, similar to fructose at 72 h. This suggests fructose is not only a lipogenic substrate but is as lipogenic as fatty acids that are directly incorporated into TGs. This finding was also qualitatively verified with an Oil red O stain, validating increased intracellular lipids following the fructose treatments [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Oil red O was also used by Montesano et al. (2020), where 5 mM fructose increased the staining intensity of Oil red O 5-fold compared to the control [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Oil red O protocols vary widely and are difficult to compare to TG assays, yet the trend reported adds evidence to the fact that fructose potently increases TGs in HepG2 cells. However, the concentration of glucose in the media of the published studies discussed was not reported. This is a critical factor, as it would indicate if it were the total carbohydrate or fructose that accounted for the increased TG accumulation. Glucose is also a substrate for DNL, and it has been reported as necessary for fructose to induce TG accumulation in HepG2 cells [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], highlighting the importance of not only considering but also reporting the media glucose concentration. Further complicating this, HepG2 cells are often hyperglycolytic, relying on metabolism of glucose rather than oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. Therefore, in the current study, HepG2 cells passaged in low- and high-glucose media were tested to determine if excess media glucose affected fructose-induced DNL.</p><p>Multiple studies do, however, report the glucose concentration in the culture media. Amorim et al. (2021) investigated lipid accumulation using the fluorescence of Nile red (normalised to cell protein) [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. HepG2 cells cultured in media with 5 mM glucose were exposed to 10 mM fructose for 1, 6, or 24 h. No effect was seen at 24 h in contrast to the studies mentioned previously. However, this result agrees with experiments conducted in the current study where the fluorescent intensity of Nile red did not change at 48 h in response to 20 mM fructose. Comparable to the current study, Amorim et al. (2021) [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported no additional effect of fructose on lipid accumulation in the presence of 0.5 mM palmitic acid and in the presence of a 0.25 mM combination of fatty acids. A 24 h exposure may be too short to observe fructose-induced DNL, and how long it takes for this effect to be seen is not consistent across studies. Additionally, Amorim et al. (2021) [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] confirmed an upregulation of fructokinase following fructose exposure, confirming a result reported by Lanaspa et al. (2012) [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] that fructose metabolism to fructose-1-phosphate occurs in HepG2 cells and results in positive feedback.</p><p>In agreement with Amorim et al. (2021) [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Huggett et al. (2023) reported that in HepG2 cells exposed to a more physiological concentration of fructose (2 and 8 mM), no change in Nile red fluorescent intensity was detected at 48 h [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This agrees with results in the current study in which Nile red was used; however, Huggett et al. (2023) [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] used a lower concentration of fructose. Interestingly, the null result of fructose on lipid accumulation was reported in both high (11 mM)- and physiological (5 mM)-glucose media and in the presence, and absence, of a fatty acid mixture (200 &#181;M) [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Another key factor is that Huggett et al. (2023) [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] treated HepG2 cells in serum-free media and then added physiological levels of insulin to the media. This was not performed in other studies, or the current experiments, and highlights that fact that variable levels of hormones present in cell culture media can regulate lipogenesis including insulin, glucagon, oestrogens, and thyroid hormones [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For example, increased levels of circulating insulin can promote lipogenesis through <italic toggle="yes">SREBP-1c</italic> activation [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], whereas oestrogen reduces lipogenesis by downregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Protocols using an acute exposure of up to 72 h are common in in vitro cell culture to investigate mechanisms related to the effect a compound has on cells. However, a disease such as steatotic liver disease that develops over years to decades [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] is poorly modelled with acute exposures. Additionally, in vivo models of steatosis in rodents can introduce fructose in the drinking water for a period of weeks to months [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The chronic model used in this study followed in vitro protocols that are similar to those used to develop drug-resistant cell lines [<xref rid="B38-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This meant cells could be exposed to fructose for a period of 28 days, far exceeding the 72 h limit in most protocols. HepG2 cells remain phenotypically stable for ~15-18 passages; hence, 28 days was the maximum exposure time [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This method could be used in future investigations into compounds that have moderate effects on TGs in HepG2 cells. In the current study, fructose and glucose exposure did not lead to an increase in TGs in HepG2 cells over 28 days; instead, they were slightly downregulated at some time points. When taken together with the result that non-physiological concentrations of fructose (80 mM) also reduced TG concentrations, this implies that both high concentrations and chronic exposures to fructose reduce TG concentrations in HepG2 cells. This highlights a limitation of studies reporting a positive effect at 24 h as this may only reflect a rapid change in the cell, whereas chronic exposure may better reflect subtle adaptive change over time, therefore better modelling dietary exposure. Further investigation is needed using primary human hepatocytes that are non-replicating, as carcinoma-derived HepG2 cells divide rapidly and may shunt excess sugars into nucleotide and amino acid synthesis pathways to facilitate cell division, rather than lipid storage. However, in the current study the results were normalised to total cell protein to account for this. Further investigation into fructose-induced modulation of aerobic and glycolytic processes is needed to fully understand how fructose could reduce TG concentrations under certain conditions.</p><p>Once it was confirmed that no change in TG concentration in HepG2 cells occurred following a 48 h and 28-day exposure to fructose, the expression levels of transcription factors and enzymes in relation to lipogenesis were investigated. As TG synthesis and mobilisation are tightly regulated [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a short exposure of 6 h was chosen to examine transient changes that may return to baseline over time. This time point was also chosen to be less than 24 h, where no phenotypic effect was seen in TG accumulation. qPCR assays are the gold standard for detecting changes in the expression level of genes of interest [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. qPCR was selected over Western blotting to investigate the expression levels of transcription factors and enzymes of interest related to DNL. As the levels of transcription factors and enzymes were examined at 6 h, a sensitive method of detection was required. Hence, qPCR, which detects changes in mRNA upstream of translation to proteins, was selected [<xref rid="B41-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The novel primers used were validated to be specific to one target and efficient across a range of cDNA concentrations. Rather than assessing the level of every gene in the pathway of DNL, the central transcription factors LXR-&#945; and SPREBP-1c were selected. ACACA was also selected as it acts upstream of where oleic and palmitic acid are incorporated into TGs, and FAS was selected as it is the rate-limiting enzyme in DNL [<xref rid="B42-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Yu et al. (2018) reported in HepG2 cells exposed to 20 mM fructose for 72 h that the expression level of transcription factors <italic toggle="yes">SREBP-1c</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ChREBP</italic> was upregulated 5-fold and 2-fold, respectively [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the current study, exposure to the same concentration of fructose or 20 mM glucose for 6 h had no effect on the expression of <italic toggle="yes">SREBP-1c</italic>. There was also no effect on <italic toggle="yes">LXR-&#945;</italic>, which regulates the expression of both <italic toggle="yes">SREBP-1c</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ChREBP</italic>. Yu et al. (2018) [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] also reported that the protein levels of ACACA, FASN, and SCD-1 were all upregulated 2-fold in response to 20 mM fructose. This is in line with the 2.5-fold increase in ATP-citrate lyase, an enzyme upstream of ACACA, in response to 20 mM fructose reported by Lanaspa et al. (2012), whereas in the current study, no change in <italic toggle="yes">ACACA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">FASN</italic> was seen in response to 20 mM fructose [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, in another investigation, Hirahatake et al. (2011) reported that no change in the mRNA expression or protein level of FAS or ACACA occurred following exposure to 5 mM fructose or glucose for 24, 48, or 72 h [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Similarly to TG accumulation, results for gene expression are discordant in the literature. The current experiments agree with Hirahatake et al. (2011) [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; however, a shorter exposure period was used. The null effect in the current study on the transcription of genes encoding two key transcription factors and two key enzymes involved in DNL confirms and agrees with results previously discussed where no changes in TG accumulation occurred and that fructose has no effect on DNL at a transcriptional or phenotypic level.</p><p>The observed reduction in <italic toggle="yes">SREBP-1c</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">FASN</italic> in response to fatty acids confirmed that while no effect was seen in response to fructose, the mechanisms of DNL can be modulated in HepG2 cells. A moderate decrease in the expression level of <italic toggle="yes">FASN</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SREBP-1c</italic> in response to the combined fatty acid exposure was detected, and agrees with a study by Zhang et al. (2023) in the mouse liver cell line NCTC 1469 [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In this study, cells were exposed to a combined fatty acid mixture (750 &#181;M) for 24 h, a 4.5-fold higher concentration than that used in the current study. The fatty acid mixture reduced the expression level of <italic toggle="yes">SREBP-1c</italic> by 20% and <italic toggle="yes">FASN</italic> by 40% compared to 36% and 41%, respectively, in the current study. Zhang et al. (2023) [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] also confirmed that at a protein level, ACACA was reduced as well as ATP-citrate lyase. It was concluded that negative feedback from excessive TG/lipid accumulation downregulated DNL in cells. As oleic acid and palmitic acid are products of DNL, negative feedback to reduce the expression level of transcription factors and enzymes involved in DNL likely also accounts for the results in the current study. Further investigation of protein levels or activity would strengthen this association as any direct interaction with proteins would be uncovered; however, as fructose did not increase the expression of the genes tested, this was not undertaken.</p><p>This study used HepG2 cells which have 80% sequence homology with liver tissue and are used in over half of in vitro liver studies [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, low expression of enzymes involved in the pathway of fructose metabolism including aldolase B and predominantly glycolytic metabolism are limitations of using this cell line as a model to investigate effects of fructose in the liver [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Specifically, cancer cell lines can utilise glycolysis and shunt sugars into the pentose phosphate pathway to promote cell division, rather than store energy intracellularly, for example, as glycogen and lipid droplets [<xref rid="B45-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. If this metabolic reprogramming occurs in HepG2 cells, then the findings of the current study support the conclusion that despite being widely used, HepG2 cells are not an adequate model to test fructose in the context of steatosis, rather than the conclusion that fructose is not a lipogenic substrate.</p><p>Future investigations into this topic should consider the use of other hepatocyte models including HepaRG cells or primary human hepatocytes which retain 88 and 92% sequence homology, respectively, with liver tissue [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-17-02762" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These cells have their own set of limitations including cost, limited access, and the technical expertise required to maintain differentiated cells lines. Similarly, 2D monolayer cultures poorly model the unique structures and cell arrangements of the liver. Co-cultures with non-parenchymal cells and 3D cultures such as spheroids, organoids, or organs-on-a-chip present more advanced models where the structure and therefore function of hepatocytes are better preserved. These models may more accurately determine the effect of fructose in TG accumulation and DNL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-nutrients-17-02762"><title>5.
