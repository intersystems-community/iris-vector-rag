Despite current multimodal therapies, including surgery, radiation, and temozolomide chemotherapy, patient outcomes remain poor. Enhancing tumor radiosensitivity through biocompatible nanomaterials could provide a promising integrative strategy for improving therapeutic effectiveness. This study aims to evaluate the potential of bovine serum albumin-coated copper oxide nanoparticles (BSA@CuO-NPs) to enhance radiosensitivity in U87-MG cells under clinically relevant X-ray irradiation. In brief, BSA@CuO-NPs were synthesized via carbodiimide crosslinking and characterized by DLS, SEM, and zeta potential analysis. U87-MG cells were treated with BSA@CuO-NPs alone or in combination with X-ray irradiation (2 Gy). Cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT assay, while radiosensitization was evaluated through clonogenic survival analysis. Apoptosis induction and DNA damage were analyzed via Annexin V staining and &#947;-H2AX immunofluorescence, respectively. The results revealed that BSA@CuO-NPs showed good colloidal stability and biocompatibility compared with uncoated CuO-NPs. When combined with irradiation, BSA@CuO-NPs significantly decreased clonogenic survival (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and increased apoptotic cell death compared to irradiation alone. Immunofluorescence demonstrated increased &#947;-H2AX focus formation, indicating higher DNA double-strand breaks in the combination group. In conclusion, BSA@CuO-NPs enhance the effects of ionizing radiation by increasing DNA damage and apoptosis in U87-MG cells, indicating their potential as combined radiosensitizers. These results support further research into albumin-coated metal oxide nanoparticles as adjuncts to standard radiotherapy for the management of GBM. One challenge in this context is the effective delivery of nanoparticles to GBM. However, the stability of BSA@CuO-NPs in physiological solutions could help overcome this obstacle.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>glioblastoma</kwd><kwd>bovine serum albumin</kwd><kwd>copper oxide nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>radiosensitivity</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>University Income Fund, Naresuan University</funding-source><award-id>R2567C041</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the University Income Fund, Naresuan University, grant number: R2567C041.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-nanomaterials-15-01376"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most aggressive and treatment-resistant primary brain tumor in adults, constituting approximately 48% of all malignant tumors of the central nervous system [<xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite aggressive multimodal strategies, including maximal surgical resection, adjuvant radiotherapy, and concomitant as well as adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, the prognosis for GBM remains poor, with a median survival of around 12&#8211;15 months [<xref rid="B3-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A significant obstacle to effective treatment is the natural radioresistance of GBM cells, which results from several factors, including efficient DNA repair, a hypoxic tumor environment, and defective apoptosis signaling.</p><p>Radiotherapy (RT) remains a cornerstone in the treatment of GBM, yet its efficacy is frequently hindered by the intrinsic resistance of the tumor to ionizing radiation. This resistance is primarily attributed to the ability of GBM cells to efficiently repair sublethal DNA damage and evade radiation-induced mitotic catastrophe [<xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a result, enhancing the radiosensitivity of GBM cells has become a central focus in the development of adjunctive therapeutic strategies, among which the use of nanoparticles as radiosensitizers has gained increasing attention [<xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Nanoparticles composed of high-atomic-number (Z) elements can amplify local radiation effects by increasing photoelectric and Compton interactions, thereby promoting localized energy deposition and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref rid="B7-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These ROS, such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions, induce oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and extensive DNA damage, especially double-strand breaks (DSBs), which represent the most lethal form of radiation-induced injury [<xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Metal oxide nanoparticles, due to their unique physicochemical properties like enhanced reactivity due to high surface area, tunable bandgap, ROS generation, shape control, and redox activity due to Cu<sup>2+</sup> &#8596; Cu<sup>+</sup> cycling, represent a promising subclass of nanomaterials that can enhance both the physical and biological effects of radiation, thereby offering new opportunities for improving GBM radiotherapy outcomes [<xref rid="B7-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Beyond their role in increasing physical radiation dose, metal oxide nanoparticles have demonstrated promising biological radiosensitizing effects. Nanoparticles, such as zinc oxide (ZnO), cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>), and titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), are known to regulate oxidative stress, disrupt DNA repair processes, and induce apoptosis in cancer cells, thereby enhancing their sensitivity to radiation [<xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These nanoparticles can also selectively accumulate in tumor tissues through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, thereby reducing damage to healthy tissue during radiotherapy [<xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Among them, CuO nanoparticles (CuO-NPs) are especially notable because of their atomic number (Z = 29) and strong oxidative potential. Moreover, copper-based nanomaterials have been extensively studied in biomedicine, not only for their radiosensitizing potential but also for their broad applications in antibacterial therapy, wound healing, and anticancer strategies, including the development of copper complexes [<xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In particular, CuO-NPs can increase radiation-induced cytotoxicity by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) both independently and in combination with other factors, such as inhibition of DNA repair pathways and induction of cell cycle arrest in radiosensitive phases [<xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The resulting oxidative stress causes damage to cellular components, reduces mitochondrial function, disrupts the cell cycle, and increases DNA double-strand breaks, indicating a promising factor in radiosensitization [<xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>However, a significant challenge in using nanoparticles clinically is their tendency to aggregate in physiological environments, reducing their bioavailability and therapeutic effectiveness. To overcome this, surface functionalization with biocompatible molecules has been examined to enhance dispersion, cellular uptake, and overall efficacy in cancer treatments [<xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this study, surface modification with biocompatible proteins, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), has been employed. BSA not only stabilizes nanoparticles in biological fluids but also promotes cellular uptake by forming a biocompatible protein corona that facilitates receptor-mediated endocytosis, while simultaneously reducing aggregation and surface charge repulsion. In addition, BSA coating helps extend systemic circulation by enhancing nanoparticle stability and reducing clearance via the mononuclear phagocyte system [<xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, BSA has functional groups that can be linked to nanoparticle surfaces, facilitating controlled dispersion and enhanced interaction with cancer cells [<xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. BSA-coated CuO nanoparticles (BSA@CuO-NPs) thus represent an attractive nanosystem for radiosensitization, combining enhanced stability with biological compatibility.</p><p>Given their capacity to enhance reactive oxygen species, regulate the cell cycle, and suppress DNA repair mechanisms, CuO-NPs have attracted attention as radiosensitizers in GBM [<xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, their clinical translation is hindered by poor biocompatibility, non-specific biodistribution, and instability in physiological environments. In this study, we address these challenges by synthesizing BSA@CuO-NPs and showing their capacity to increase the radiosensitivity of U87-MG glioblastoma cells during megavoltage X-ray irradiation. A comprehensive biological evaluation, including cytotoxicity, clonogenic survival, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and &#947;-H2AX-based DNA damage analysis, demonstrates their potential as a next-generation nanomedicine-based radiosensitizer and provides a foundation for future translational studies in GBM.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nanomaterials-15-01376"><title>2.

Preparation of BSA-Coated CuO Nanoparticles (BSA@CuO-NPs)</title><p>BSA@CuO-NPs were synthesized using carbodiimide crosslinking chemistry for biomedical applications, as previously reported [<xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. First, 3 mg of CuO nanoparticles (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were dispersed in 750 &#181;L of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and sonicated using a sonication probe for 60 s to achieve a uniform dispersion. Separately, 5 mg each of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC, Sigma-Aldrich), along with 7.5 mg of bovine serum albumin (BSA; Fraction V, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), were dissolved in 750 &#181;L of PBS and preconditioned in a sonication bath for 15 min. The EDC, NHS, and BSA solutions were then combined sequentially and mixed with the CuO suspension to create a total reaction volume of 3 mL. The final concentration of BSA in the reaction mixture was 2.5 mg/mL, which falls within the commonly used range for protein functionalization of metal oxide nanoparticles, ensuring effective surface coating and colloidal stability without excess unbound protein. The complete mixture was continuously stirred at room temperature using a magnetic stirrer for 24 h to facilitate the covalent conjugation of BSA to the nanoparticle surface. After incubation, the nanoparticle suspension was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and washed twice with PBS to remove residual reagents and unbound BSA. The resulting pellet of BSA@CuO-NPs was lyophilized and stored at 4 &#176;C until further use.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-nanomaterials-15-01376"><title>2.2. Characterization</title><sec id="sec2dot2dot1-nanomaterials-15-01376"><title>2.2.1. Hydrodynamic Size and Zeta Potential</title><p>The hydrodynamic diameter, PDI, and surface charge (zeta potential) of CuO and BSA@CuO nanoparticles were measured using a Zetasizer Ultra (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK). Bare CuO nanoparticles were initially resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), which caused extensive aggregation in suspension. For each measurement, 2 &#181;L of nanoparticle suspension was diluted in 1 mL of deionized water, gently mixed, and loaded into a disposable polystyrene cuvette. Measurements were performed at 25 &#176;C after a brief equilibration period.

This result highlights the stronger genotoxic response triggered by BSA@CuO-NPs in combination with ionizing radiation, supporting their potential as effective radiosensitizers for glioblastoma therapy.</p><p>The combined treatment significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells and affected cell cycle progression. As illustrated in <xref rid="nanomaterials-15-01376-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="nanomaterials-15-01376-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, these findings support the mechanisms of radiosensitization by demonstrating both cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Specifically, arrest at the G2/M phase is particularly crucial because cells in this stage are highly radiosensitive due to their reduced DNA repair capacity and condensed chromatin structure [<xref rid="B47-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase following combined treatment indicates activation of cell cycle checkpoints in response to persistent DNA damage, which is concurrently associated with a significant increase in apoptotic cell death [<xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this study, BSA@CuO-NPs further enhanced the sensitivity of U87-MG cells to ionizing radiation and promoted apoptosis by activating downstream signaling pathways. These observations are consistent with previous reports showing that nanoparticle surface modification can augment radiation-induced apoptosis [<xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that CuO nanoparticles can promote radiosensitization through oxidative stress and apoptotic signaling. Shafagh et al. reported that CuO nanoparticles increased ROS generation, modulated pro- and anti-apoptotic gene expression (p53, Bax, Bcl-2), and induced apoptosis in leukemia cells via mitochondrial pathways [<xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Similarly, Chakraborty et al. showed that CuO nanoparticles can act as a copper ion reservoir, leading to sustained oxidative stress and apoptosis when co-delivered with Elesclomol in lung cancer cells [<xref rid="B51-nanomaterials-15-01376" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Together with our findings, these reports highlight the dual ability of BSA@CuO-NPs to disrupt cell cycle progression and trigger apoptotic signaling, underscoring their promise as potent radiosensitizers, particularly in treatment-resistant glioblastoma.</p><p>Despite the promising findings, several limitations must be acknowledged. Initially, the study focused only on a single glioblastoma cell line (U87-MG), which might not fully represent the biological diversity or varying radiosensitivity in GBM. Future research should incorporate multiple glioblastoma models, such as patient-derived and inherently radioresistant cell lines, to confirm whether the radiosensitizing effects of BSA@CuO-NPs under ionizing radiation conditions are broadly applicable to radiation therapy. Second, no non-malignant glial or neural cell line was used for comparison, precluding an assessment of the nanoparticles&#8217; selective cytotoxicity and safety profile. Third, although the combined treatment with BSA@CuO-NPs and 2 Gy radiation enhanced DNA damage, apoptosis, and G2/M arrest, the underlying mechanisms, such as ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction, were not directly investigated. Future work should include mechanistic and in vivo studies to support clinical translation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-nanomaterials-15-01376"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study reports the successful creation of BSA@CuO-NPs via EDC/NHS-mediated carbodiimide chemistry, producing a stable, protein-coated nanostructure with improved physicochemical traits. In vitro tests using U87-MG cells showed that BSA@CuO-NPs are tolerated at sublethal doses but significantly enhance the effects of ionizing radiation. The combination treatment drastically decreased clonogenic survival, increased apoptosis, and caused strong G2/M cell cycle arrest. Notably, &#947;-H2AX analysis confirmed that BSA@CuO-NPs greatly enhance radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks, highlighting their promising radiosensitizing ability in U87-MG cells. These results suggest that BSA@CuO-NPs are effective radiosensitizers, promoting DNA damage and cell cycle disruption to improve the radiation response. However, this remains a preclinical proof-of-concept. While promising, these findings need validation in additional glioblastoma models, mechanistic studies, and in vivo systems before clinical application. The stability of BSA@CuO-NPs in physiological fluids may support their development as future therapeutics.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors sincerely thank the Faculty of Allied Health Sciences at Naresuan University for generously providing the facilities and institutional support needed for the experimental work.
