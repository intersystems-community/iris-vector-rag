To address these issues, China initiated reforms to the basic pension insurance system for institutions, including universities, on October 1, 2014, establishing a ten-year transition period.

This increase was mainly due to the introduction of the occupational annuity system.

Notably, cumulative years of payment influenced by gender and other factors had the greatest impact on these levels.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The implementation of the occupational annuity system during the transition period revealed certain shortcomings in the endowment insurance reform. The transitional pension from the Social Collective Fund represents a significant portion of total pension expenditure, creating a heavy financial burden on the fund. Additionally, extending and standardizing retirement age for men and women can help reduce gender income disparities. Delayed retirement alleviates pressure on social pension systems by increasing individual incomes and aligning pension levels with societal needs. This approach promotes social equity and provides adequate care for older adults.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>General Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>2025SJYB1255</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Xu-Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the General Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province (grants 2025SJYB1255).

Introduction</title><p>The sustainability of old age insurance systems remains a critical challenge for both developed and developing nations [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To establish a more equitable, sustainable, and unified social pension insurance system, the Chinese government initiated a pension insurance system for public institutions on October 1, 2014. These reforms are guided by the principles of comprehensive coverage, basic insurance provision, multitiered development, and sustainability, aiming to enhance equity, address liquidity needs, and ensure long-term viability. A key objective is to align the pension insurance model for institutions with that for enterprises, thereby eliminating disparities in pension calculations between retirees from enterprises and institutions [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Under this new policy, public institutions have now adopted a basic pension insurance system consistent with that of enterprise workers, combining an institutional planning model with individual accounts. Payments are shared between institutions and individuals at specified ratios. Moreover, reforms in pension planning and distribution methods have been introduced along with a basic pension adjustment mechanism and the implementation of an occupational annuity system.</p><p>Since the implementation of the pension reform, individuals who commenced employment before September 30, 2014 and retired after October 1, 2014 have entered a transitional phase between the old and new systems. To protect the rights of retirees from public institutions, a 10-year transitional period (October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2024) was established, during which a unified retirement approach was adopted. The retirement benefits during this period are governed by the &#8220;high guaranteed bottom limit&#8221; principle: if an individual&#8217;s planned benefits (including occupational annuity provisions) fall below the pre-transition standards, payments can be adjusted to meet those standards; if the benefits exceed the pre-transition standards, a ceiling can be applied. As the 10-year transition period approaches its conclusion, it becomes critical to assess changes in retiree benefits before and during this phase, identify the factors driving these changes, and determine the most influential elements. In addition, the impact of the occupational annuity system on retiree benefits during this period warrants further examination.</p><p>Chinese universities are primarily public institutions. This study employed empirical analysis of survey data from retired employees at these institutions to explore the issues outlined above. A random sample of 1,200 retirees from Jiangsu Province who retired before September 30, 2014 (pre-transition period) and 3,270 retirees who retired between October 1, 2014, and December 31, 2023 (transition period) was selected. First, the analysis compared the total pension income of employees across the two periods. The findings revealed a significant increase in total pension income during both periods, with the difference between them remaining relatively stable. The occupational annuity policy implemented during the transition period has been identified as a key factor contributing to disparities in pension outcomes. To further explore these differences, statistical analyses were conducted to examine the factors influencing basic pension calculations during the transition period, including gender, retirement year, post category, and grade. The findings revealed that gender significantly affected payment years, actual average payment index, personal account accumulations, and occupational annuity balances among male and female employees within the same retirement year. Additionally, variations in retirement years between male and female employees of the same age substantially affected the overall pension income. The disparities in post categories and grades also contributed to the imbalances in planned payment months, actual average payment index, basic pensions, personal account pensions, transitional pensions, and occupational annuities, further influencing retirees&#8217; overall pension income during the transition period. These findings could provide valuable insights for Chinese social institutions to develop and refine their retirement systems beyond the transition period.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>2.

To examine this further, we analyzed the trends in basic pensions and occupational annuities for transition-period retirees and compared them with the per capita overall pensions of pre-transition retirees. The results indicated that both the average basic pension and occupational annuities for transitional retirees increased annually (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). Notably, the basic pension for transition retirees consistently surpassed the overall pension of pre-transition retirees, while the gap gradually narrowed.

By 2023, the average overall pension for pre-transition retirees increased to 9535.33&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1660.82 RMB/month, and the basic pension for transition-period retirees rose to 10498.49&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2193.95 RMB/month, reducing the gap to 963.16 RMB/month. Since October 1, 2014, occupational annuity policies have been applied only to transition-period retirees. As occupational annuities increased annually, the anticipated reduction or elimination of pension disparities between pre-transition and transition retirees has not been observed. Instead, throughout the transition period, a significant and relatively stable gap in per capita overall pensions persisted between the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>3.2. Impact of gender and retirement year on the basic pension of university retirees during the transition period</title><p>The impact of pension policies on retirees&#8217; pensions during the transition period is a critical issue for numerous in-service personnel as it can directly affect their post-retirement quality of life. Additionally, this issue provides valuable insights for governments to formulate and adjust pension policies beyond the transition period. This study examined how gender and retirement age affect basic pensions during the transition phase. Under China&#8217;s current retirement policy, on average, men retire five years later than women. As a result, men typically retire later than women of the same age group, which is a key factor contributing to disparities in basic pension amounts.</p><p>When men and women retire in the same year, the calculation formula for the basic pension during the transition period indicates that the positive factors influencing men&#8217;s pensions, such as the average monthly salary of local employees in the previous year, actual payment years, actual average payment index, accumulated personal account balances, and occupational pension accumulations at retirement, are generally more favorable than those for women. Conversely, men face a disadvantage compared to women in terms of negative factors such as planned payment months. These differences can collectively result in men receiving a higher average basic pension than women retiring in the same year (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref></bold>).</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0332068.g002" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0332068.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Annual variations in basic pensions for retired men and women during the transition period.</title><p><bold>A:</bold> Disparity in the basic pension between men and women who retire in the same year (two-tailed unpaired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test). <bold>B:</bold> Difference in basic pensions between men and women of identical age within the same year upon reaching their respective statutory retirement age (two-tailed unpaired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test).

For example, a woman who reached retirement age in 2014 would have a male counterpart who did not retire until 2019. During the transition period, the calculation formula for the basic pension indicates that the positive and negative factors influencing the pension remain consistent when male and female employees retire simultaneously. According to data from China&#8217;s National Bureau of Statistics, the average monthly salary in Jiangsu Province rose from 5,149 yuan a decade ago to 8,623 yuan a year. Consequently, males who retire later benefit from higher average monthly salaries, resulting in an even greater average basic pension for men than for women when they retire at their respective statutory ages (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref></bold>).</p><p>Promoting a voluntary and flexible retirement policy along with the gradual and orderly implementation of a delayed legal retirement age and advocating for equal retirement ages for men and women can effectively address inconsistencies in retirement years caused by gender differences. This approach would help reduce disparities in basic pension payments and achieve equity in basic pension income between men and women after retirement.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>3.3. Impact of gender and retirement year on occupational annuities for university retirees during transition</title><p>The overall pension during the transition period comprises a basic pension and an occupational annuity. According to China&#8217;s retirement regulations, the occupational annuity fund is derived from payments made by universities and individuals, income generated from the fund&#8217;s investment and operations, and other income stipulated by the state. Moreover, the factors influencing the payment base of occupational annuity are closely linked to the gender and retirement year of retirees after the reform implementation date (September 30, 2014). Building on the analysis of the impact of gender and retirement year on basic pension, this study further examined their effects on occupational annuity.</p><p>We first analyzed the impact of gender and retirement year on retirees&#8217; occupational annuities. The findings revealed that when men and women retired in the same year, men may typically retire later than women. Consequently, there were fewer months in which men could receive occupational annuity payments after retirement than for women. However, this ultimately resulted in a higher occupational annuity income for men than for women (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref></bold>).</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0332068.g003" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0332068.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Annual changes in occupational annuities for retired men and women during the transition period.</title><p><bold>A:</bold> Difference in basic pensions between men and women who retired in the same year (two-tailed unpaired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test). <bold>B:</bold> Difference in the basic pension of men and women of identical age at the time they reach their statutory retirement age (two-tailed unpaired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test).

However, during the transition period, men had significantly more years of occupational annuity payments than women. As a result, men&#8217;s occupational annuity income was even higher than that of women when they reached their statutory retirement age separately (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref></bold>). This income disparity reflected the principle of &#8220;paying more and getting more, paying more and getting more for longer&#8221; embedded in the reform of the pension insurance system. Therefore, postponing retirement could effectively enhance individual occupational annuity income, whereas simultaneous retirement for men and women in the same cohort could help eliminate gender-based disparities in occupational annuity income.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>3.4.

Furthermore, within each post category, the average basic pension increased with higher post levels. According to the basic pension calculation formula during the transition period, factors such as planned payment months, actual average payment index, base pensions, personal account pensions, and transitional pensions influenced monthly pension payments.

correlation was observed between the number of planned payment months and monthly payment amounts for personal account pensions. As the retirement age increased, the average number of planned payment months decreased. Higher post categories and levels also corresponded to fewer planned payment months. Notably, the professional and technical staff had a higher average retirement age than the management staff, who could retire later than ground-skilled staff. The statistical analysis indicated that the average number of planned payment months was 163.43&#8201;&#177;&#8201;26.31 for the ground-skilled staff, 147.39&#8201;&#177;&#8201;14.50 for the management staff, and 135.34&#8201;&#177;&#8201;18.15 for the professional and technical staff (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Within each post category, an increase in the post level generally correlated with a decrease in planned payment months.</p><p>The actual average payment index was positively correlated with the monthly salary payment base of retired employees, with higher post levels corresponding to a higher salary payment base. Professional and technical staff had the highest salary payment base, followed by management and ground-skilled staff. The average actual average payment index was 1.19&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.18 for the professional and technical staff, 1.61&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.34 for the management staff, and 1.82&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.30 for the ground-skilled staff (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Furthermore, within each job category, an increase in the post level generally corresponded to a higher payment index.</p><p>The standard basic pension was positively correlated with the average monthly salary and payment index of local employees in the year prior to retirement. As noted earlier, the payment index increased with higher post levels. Additionally, differences in post categories can influence the retirement year for individuals of the same age, with those in higher posts typically retiring later. Over the past decade, the average monthly salaries of active workers have consistently increased. Consequently, retirees with higher post-retirement levels and later retirement years generally experience a higher average monthly salary in their final working year. Professional and technical staff tended to have the highest average monthly salary before retirement, followed by management staff, and then ground-skilled staff. Our findings confirmed the following trends. The average standard basic pension for the professional and technical staff was 4296.52&#8201;&#177;&#8201;846.41 RMB, for the management staff 3827.94&#8201;&#177;&#8201;702.12 RMB, and for the ground-skilled staff 2852.92&#8201;&#177;&#8201;785.89 RMB (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Additionally, within each job category, standard basic pensions significantly increased with higher post levels.</p><p>The calculation of personal account pensions is closely related to the accumulated amount in the personal account of the basic pension insurance and the number of planned payment months at retirement. The number of payment months is negatively associated with personal account pensions and decreases with later retirement. The accumulated amount in personal accounts is directly proportional to the payment index and the payment period. For public institution employees, the payment index and periods are significantly influenced by factors such as post category and post level. Our study suggested that the professional and technical staff received the highest average personal account pension at 583.55&#8201;&#177;&#8201;338.07 RMB, followed by the management staff at 454.10&#8201;&#177;&#8201;294.71 RMB, while the ground-skilled staff received the lowest at 229.97&#8201;&#177;&#8201;174.67 RMB (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Within each post category, higher post levels corresponded to increased personal account pensions. This reflects variations in the cumulative payment periods across post categories. As the payment period increased, the accumulated savings in personal pension insurance accounts increased annually, causing a gradual rise in personal account pensions. This trend aligned with the principle of &#8220;contributing more and for longer to receive more&#8221;. Consequently, delayed retirement extended the actual payment period, leading to higher cumulative savings and increased personal account pensions. These findings demonstrate that implementing a flexible retirement system can enhance individual income levels after retirement.</p><p>The transitional pension is positively correlated with the average monthly salary of local employees in the previous year, equivalent payment index, and equivalent payment years. The equivalent payment index is influenced by an individual&#8217;s post category, post level, and pre-retirement salary and also increases with longer service periods. Thus, individuals in higher positions, with greater ranks, salaries, and tenures, tend to receive higher transitional pensions. Our study indicated that the professional and technical staff received the highest transitional pensions, averaging 5861.92&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1340.46 RMB, followed by the management staff at 4882.30&#8201;&#177;&#8201;991.08 RMB, and the ground-skilled staff at 3461.20&#8201;&#177;&#8201;962.70 RMB (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Within the same post category, transitional pensions increased with higher post levels. The transitional pensions were financed by the Social Collective Fund, in which a higher equivalent payment index led to a higher transitional pension. However, excessively high transitional pensions exacerbated the shortage of China&#8217;s social pension funds, further straining the system under the pressure of an aging population. Adjusting the equivalent payment index can effectively balance the relationship between transitional and basic pensions. Moreover, implementing a policy of delayed retirement could reduce the proportion of transitional pensions within the basic pension, serving as an effective measure to alleviate pressure on the Social Collective Fund.</p><p>We analyzed the correlation between the basic pension and its constituent factors, specifically focusing on the standard basic pension, personal account pension, and transitional pension across different post categories (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref></bold>). For professional and technical staff, the correlation with the basic pension was ranked as follows: standard basic pension&#8201;&gt;&#8201;personal account pension&#8201;&gt;&#8201;transitional pension (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). For management staff, the ranking was standard basic pension&#8201;&gt;&#8201;transitional pension&#8201;&gt;&#8201;personal account pension (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref></bold>). For ground-skilled staff, the order shifts to standard basic pension&#8201;&gt;&#8201;personal account pension&#8201;&gt;&#8201;transitional pension (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref></bold>). Across all three categories, the standard basic pension exhibited the strongest correlation with the basic pension. As both were closely related to an individual&#8217;s cumulative payment period, our findings suggested that delaying retirement could significantly increase an individual&#8217;s final basic pension.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0332068.g004" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0332068.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Correlation between the factors that constitute the basic pension and the basic pension of retirees in different post categories.</title><p><bold>A:</bold> Correlation between the factors that constitute the basic pension, namely the standard basic pension, transitional pension, and personal account pension, and the basic pension of retirees among professional and technical staff (Pearson correlation test). <bold>B:</bold> Correlation between the factors that constitute the basic pension, namely the standard basic pension, transitional pension, and personal account pension, and the basic pension of retirees in management staff (Pearson correlation test). <bold>C:</bold> Correlation between the factors that constitute the basic pension, namely the standard basic pension, transitional pension, and personal account pension, and the basic pension of retirees among ground-skilled staff (Pearson correlation test).</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0332068.g004.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>3.5.

During the 10-year transition period following the reform of the basic pension insurance system, pensions for public institution employees who retired before or during the transition period exhibited a steady upward trend.

Firstly, the stabilization of income disparities arising from occupational annuities supports Esping-Andersen&#8217;s (1990) discussions on path dependence within welfare system theory [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This indicates that during periods of institutional transition, the cumulative effects of both legacy systems and new frameworks may reinforce rather than alleviate existing structures of inequality. Secondly, the fiscal pressures faced by the social pooling fund are consistent with Barr and Diamond&#8217;s (2008) pay-as-you-go pension theory [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], thereby underscoring the challenges posed by uneven regional economic development to the sustainability of pension systems in light of population mobility. Thirdly, regarding policies for postponing retirement, this study&#8217;s findings lend support to Cahill et al.&#8217;s (2015) theoretical framework on flexible retirement [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Specifically, gradual adjustments to the retirement age can relieve pressure on pension disbursements while simultaneously promoting a more rational utilization of elderly human resources. Notably, this study&#8217;s discovery concerning the gender-based pension gap enriches Foster and Walker&#8217;s (2015) theory on the cumulative process of gender inequality across the life cycle [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It reveals how disparities in retirement ages further exacerbate poverty risks faced by elderly women through mechanisms such as differences in contribution periods and access to occupational annuities.</p><p>These findings offer significant theoretical insights for understanding the social implications of China&#8217;s pension system reform and provide valuable empirical evidence for comparative research on welfare systems in emerging economies. Based on these findings, this study thus proposes several recommendations.</p><sec id="sec019"><title>4.1. Adjustment of occupational annuity payment rate and level reasonably to ensure fairness within the pension insurance system</title><p>Occupational annuity is a vital mechanism for ensuring financial security during retirement, serving as a strategy to motivate employees and attract high-quality talent. Since the reform of the basic pension insurance system on October 1, 2014, public institutions have adopted a pension system that combines basic pension insurance with occupational pension. As occupational annuities are mandatory and form a significant part of the overall pension structure, retirees from public institutions experienced annual income increases during the transition period under current payment rates and payment levels. However, this also widened the income gap between transition-period retirees and those who retired earlier (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>). To address this issue, it is imperative to adjust occupational annuity payment rates and distribution levels to fully utilize their role in ensuring pension security. Such adjustments could help mitigate income disparities between retirees before and during the transition period, thereby fostering greater social equity within China&#8217;s institutional pension insurance framework.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>4.2 Improvement of national pooling system for Social Collective Fund and establishment of uniform national standards for payments and pension measurement</title><p>Our research revealed that the transitional pension funded by the Social Collective Fund constituted the largest proportion of the monthly payable basic pension (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Significant disparities in economic development among China&#8217;s provinces have resulted in variations in employment attractiveness and driving labor mobility across regions [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Economically strong provinces have attracted large numbers of young and middle-aged employees, becoming labor-importing regions, whereas weaker provinces face population outflows and serve as labor-exporting regions. Under the current negative population growth trends, labor-exporting provinces are facing escalating challenges in ensuring pension security, as population mobility intensifies the strain on old-age care in these areas. Since the establishment of a central adjustment system for the Social Collective Fund in 2018, total adjustments exceeding 2.5 trillion RMB have alleviated financial pressures on labor-exporting provinces. Although China has achieved national pooling within its pension insurance adjustment system, migration-related complexities still require enhanced coordination. Moving forward, optimizing, and updating institutional arrangements to achieve full national integration within a &#8220;unified collection and unified expenditure&#8221; framework is an urgent priority in China&#8217;s basic pension insurance system [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Strengthening national pooling and addressing disparities in the Social Collective Fund across provinces are essential strategies for mitigating current and future pension pressure [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The transitional pension payment amount funded by the Social Collective Fund is positively correlated with payment and transition coefficients. To ensure consistency in pension benefits across provinces, the government, enterprises, and all sectors of society should collaborate to adjust payment and transition coefficients. Establishing a unified national payment standard and basic pension calculation method tailored to China&#8217;s national conditions [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] can alleviate the pressure on Social Collective Fund, ensure long-term stability of the pension system, and strengthen its role as a pillar of basic livelihood security. This approach can promote social equity, enhance retirees&#8217; quality of life, and contribute to social stability and economic development, ultimately achieving the goal of &#8220;providing for the old&#8221; while reducing the pension burden on the government [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>4.3. Implementation of a flexible delayed retirement policy and gradual introduction of voluntary retirement at the same age for both men and women</title><p>Under United Nations criteria, a country is classified as an aging society when individuals aged 60 and above constitute more than 10% of the total population or when those aged 65 and older exceed 7% [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. China officially entered an aging society in 2000 according to established criteria. After more than two decades of demographic shifts, the country experienced negative population growth for the first time in 2022 [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Projections indicate that by 2035, the population aged 60 years and above will exceed 400 million, accounting for over 30% of the total population. This trend highlights the growing severity of population aging in China [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Sustained population aging can result in continued negative growth rates, further intensifying demographic aging and exacerbating pension pressures in Chinese society [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The data analysis in this study revealed that delaying retirement could enhance individual income while alleviating the overall burden on the social pension system. This strategy can promote a mutually beneficial development path for both individuals and society to ensure pension security. Implementing a flexible delayed retirement policy is a viable strategy for addressing pension-related pressure [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, postponing retirement can benefit older adults by improving attention span, memory retention, and physical performance, while serving as a preventive measure against common chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, angina pectoris, and hypertension. This approach can positively contribute to maintaining a higher quality of life in later years [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHRLS) reveal a significant gender gap in pension benefits, with women receiving less than half of what men receive. Approximately one-third of this disparity is attributable to women&#8217;s shorter employment duration and lower salaries [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our findings highlighted the substantial differences in basic pension and occupational annuity payments, primarily driven by the different retirement ages of men and women (<bold><xref rid="pone.0332068.g002" ref-type="fig">Figs 2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332068.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref></bold>). Recognizing these disparities, China is implementing a flexible retirement policy that balances individual preferences with efforts to facilitate an orderly transition toward gradually increasing the legal retirement age. The &#8220;Global Life Expectancy in 2023&#8221; report by the World Health Organization indicates that the average life expectancy in China has risen to 78.21 years, an increase of 9.66 years from 68.55 years in 1990. Specifically, the male life expectancy reached 75.46 years, up by 8.62 years from 66.84 years in 1990, while the female life expectancy averaged 81.16 years, an increase of 10.69 years from 70.47 years in the same period, representing a gender gap of approximately 5.70 years. This trend indicates an increase in China&#8217;s aging population, with life expectancies expected to continue to rise [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our study randomly selected the retirees from universities, revealing the average retirement ages of 60.5 years for the professional and technical staff, 58.5 years for the management staff, and just under 56.5 years for the support staff. Compared to global averages, China&#8217;s current retirement age demonstrates the potential for further increases, particularly from the perspective of labor adaptability. Notably, women retire earlier than men while generally enjoying a higher life expectancy. Based on the principle of voluntariness, there is room to extend the retirement age for women to achieve the parity with men. This adjustment would help address gender-based imbalances in post-retirement income [<xref rid="pone.0332068.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec022"

</p><p>Response to Reviewer # 1&#65533;</p><p>Many thanks to the reviewer for his/her encouraging comments and valuable suggestions to our manuscript.</p><p>The following is our point-by-point reply to the issues raised by the reviewer:</p><p>Comments to the Author</p><p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p><p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented.</p><p>Reviewer #1: Partly</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously?</p><p>Reviewer #1: I Don't Know</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p><p>The PLOS Data policy requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p><p>Reviewer #1: No</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p><p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p><p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p><p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: The article addresses a globally relevant issue: population aging and its implications for pension systems. In particular, the authors focus on the Chinese pension system, analyzing the effects of a reform initiated in 2014 and structured over a ten-year transitional period.</p><p>In my opinion, although the topic is relevant and the study presents some interesting aspects, the manuscript requires a major revision before it can be considered for publication.</p><p>Among the strengths of the paper, I acknowledge:</p><p>&#8226; the clear relevance of the subject;</p><p>&#8226; the size of the dataset, which includes 1,200 retirees from before the transition and 3,270 from during the transition period.</p><p>However, several weaknesses compromise the overall quality and clarity of the manuscript. In particular:</p><p>1. Formatting issues with mathematical content</p><p>The mathematical formulas are presented inline (e.g., page 15), rather than in a proper equation environment. This makes them difficult to read. Furthermore, many symbols are introduced after the formulas, reducing their immediate comprehensibility. The mathematical notation should be cleaned up, with clearly defined variables and standalone, numbered equations where appropriate.</p><p>Response: According to the Reviewer&#8217;s suggestion, we have employed mathematical formulas to illustrate the calculation methods for pre-transition and transition pensions, with each component clearly defined and elucidated in relation to the formulas (Page 6, Lines 138-139, and Pages 7-8 in the revised manuscript). We hope that this approach will facilitate a more accessible reading experience for the audience.</p><p>2. Lack of explanation for key techniques</p><p>Several methods and indices are used without any introduction or justification. These should be properly explained, especially for non-expert readers.</p><p>Response: According to the Reviewer&#8217;s suggestion, we have included the statistical methods utilized in the figure legends. Additionally, we have incorporated statistical tables into the manuscript that provide detailed information on the tests employed, sample size (n), and statistical descriptions (S1 Table of the revised manuscript). Furthermore, we have revised what was originally Table 2 to Figure 4 to enhance the clarity and intuitiveness of the results (Figure 4 of the revised manuscript).</p><p>3. Impression of a rushed submission</p><p>The writing gives the impression that the paper was submitted prematurely. A thorough revision is necessary to improve both technical clarity and narrative cohesion. Moreover, clicking on the link to the dataset opens a page in Chinese. It would be better to upload the data to a public repository with an explanation in English, so that access is understandable internationally.</p><p>Response: According to the Reviewer&#8217;s suggestion, we have made substantial revisions to the manuscript, which include the incorporation of formulas for pension calculation and a comprehensive definition of each component within the pension framework (Page 6, Lines 138-139, and Pages 7-8 in the revised manuscript). Secondly, we provide a detailed clarification of the statistical methods employed in this study within the methods section and accompanying figure legends. Thirdly, in S1 Table, we present an exhaustive description of the statistics utilized in each figure throughout the manuscript. This includes information on comparison objects, statistical methods applied, sample sizes, and corresponding statistical results (S1 Table of the revised manuscript). Finally, due to the presence of sensitive information related to individual income, we have revised the data availability statement (Page 26, Lines 617-627 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>To conclude, I believe the study addresses an important and interesting question, and the data used are valuable. However, the authors should revise the manuscript with greater care and avoid assuming too much background knowledge on the part of the reader.</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>6.

</p><p>Dear Dr.&#160;Zhuang,</p><p>The referee is generally satisfied with the revisions and considers the article almost ready for publication. However, he has suggested that a few minor revisions are still necessary before proceeding.</p><p>Based on my own assessment, I agree with the points raised by the referee. In addition, as I mentioned in my previous email, I still do not see a stronger connection with the relevant theoretical literature, particularly in relation to the main findings. I therefore kindly ask you to address this aspect in your revised manuscript.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Sep 20 2025 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at&#160;<email>plosone@plos.org</email> .

You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version.

The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available.
