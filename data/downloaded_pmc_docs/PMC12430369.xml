Introduction</title><p>The gut&#8211;liver axis is a bidirectional regulatory system that plays a pivotal role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and immune balance [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With the rising prevalence of chronic diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, increasing attention has been paid to the influence of exogenous environmental factors on gut&#8211;liver dysfunction. Among these, dietary risk factors such as a high-fat diet (HFD) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-commonly co-occurring in modern dietary and food contamination settings-are thought to exert synergistic pathogenic effects [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>HFD is widely used as a model to simulate human metabolic disorders by promoting lipid overload, endotoxin release, and immune activation. Chronic exposure to HFD imposes sustained stress on hepatic metabolism, leading to inflammation, steatosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insulin resistance [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Conversely, AFB1, a well-known fungal toxin, can compromise gut barrier integrity and alter microbial composition, subsequently activating hepatic inflammatory pathways [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The toxic effects of AFB1 are primarily mediated through oxidative stress, DNA damage, and prolonged activation of inflammatory signaling cascades [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although HFD and AFB1 have been independently shown to affect gut and liver function [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], their potential synergistic effects and combined impact on gut&#8211;liver axis homeostasis remain insufficiently elucidated.</p><p>Recent metabolomic studies have also highlighted the relevance of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in metabolic disease pathophysiology. Isoleucine, a key member of the BCAA family, is not only involved in protein synthesis and energy metabolism but may also modulate immune responses via mTOR and NLRP3 signaling pathways [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Elevated plasma isoleucine levels have been reported in patients with metabolic syndrome, positively correlating with increased Th17 cell populations, suggesting its role as a potential metabolic trigger of immune dysregulation [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, under stress conditions such as high-fat intake or toxin exposure, the physiological effects of isoleucine may shift toward pathological outcomes. There is currently limited evidence regarding whether exogenous isoleucine contributes to liver and intestinal immune dysfunction under such complex metabolic&#8211;toxicological contexts.</p><p>To address these questions, this study employed a murine model to comprehensively assess the effects of AFB1 and HFD on gut&#8211;liver axis integrity. We further investigated the physiological responses induced by isoleucine supplementation under these conditions. Multiple dimensions were evaluated, including metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota composition. Special emphasis was placed on the Th17 inflammatory axis, redox imbalance, intestinal barrier protein expression, and microbial ecology. This study aimed to provide fundamental data for understanding how functional amino acids modulate gut&#8211;liver homeostasis under dual nutritional and toxicological stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-17-02897"><title>2.

Histological and Immunofluorescence Analysis of Ileal and Hepatic Alterations</title><p>To explore tissue-level alterations induced by AFB1, HFD, and their combined exposure, histological, immunofluorescent, and lipid staining analyses were conducted as shown in <xref rid="nutrients-17-02897-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>H&amp;E staining showed distinct ileal and hepatic pathological alterations among treatment groups. The Ctrl group had intact ileal morphology with well-organized villi, crypts, and mucosa, while the AFB1 group maintained an intact ileal mucosal structure with orderly crypts and no obvious inflammation. The HFD group showed increased crypt depth with active cell proliferation at the crypt base and inflammatory cell infiltration. Notably, the AFB1 + HFD group presented more severe ileal damage, with increased crypt depth, active cell proliferation at the crypt base, inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced number of goblet cells, and decreased intracellular mucus vacuoles.</p><p>In the liver, Ctrl group hepatocytes showed orderly hepatic cords with no steatosis or necrosis. The AFB1 group maintained overall structure with mild cytoplasmic vacuolization. The HFD group exhibited microvesicular steatosis with variably sized, well-demarcated circular vacuoles in the cytoplasm. The AFB1 + HFD group showed microvesicular steatosis with variably sized, well-demarcated circular vacuoles, with some cell nuclei displaced to the periphery, indicating enhanced metabolic stress under co-exposure.</p><p>Immunofluorescence staining clarified Th17 pathway activation. Ctrl ileum exhibited low CD4 and IL-17A expression with minimal co-localization. HFD increased CD4<sup>+</sup> and IL-17A<sup>+</sup> cell counts and fluorescence intensity. AFB1 alone had negligible effect, mirroring Ctrl levels. Strikingly, the AFB1 + HFD group demonstrated a pronounced rise in both markers, with expanded co-localized regions and stronger fluorescence, supporting Th17 activation under dual insult.</p><p>Oil Red O staining demonstrated hepatic lipid accumulation patterns. Ctrl livers lacked lipid droplets and retained structural integrity. The HFD group developed small, densely packed droplets, while the AFB1 group had only sparse deposits. The AFB1 + HFD group showed significantly larger, clustered droplets, some displacing hepatocyte nuclei&#8212;hallmarks of aggravated steatosis and hepatocellular injury.</p><p>Together, these observations suggest that AFB1 or HFD alone induce limited pathology, whereas their combination leads to pronounced intestinal barrier disruption, hepatic lipid accumulation, and Th17-mediated inflammation. It is important to note that this synergistic effect is observed across multiple pathological endpoints but not in body weight gain, where AFB1 appears to partially counteract HFD-induced weight increase. This distinction highlights that AFB1 and HFD interact differently with various physiological systems.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-nutrients-17-02897"><title>3.3.

These results indicate that the combined intervention significantly enhanced Th17-mediated hepatic inflammation. A similar trend was observed in peripheral blood, where Th17 frequencies rose from 1.94 &#177; 0.06% in the control group to 3.15 &#177; 0.06% and 3.20 &#177; 0.14% in the AFB1 and HFD groups, respectively, and further to 4.71 &#177; 0.18% in the combined group, reflecting a pronounced systemic activation of the Th17 response.

In the control groups, CD4<sup>+</sup> and IL-17A<sup>+</sup> cells were sparse, with weak fluorescent signals and minimal colocalization. In the HFD + Ile groups, fluorescent intensity increased in a dose-dependent manner, with the 100 mg group showing the strongest co-expression of CD4 and IL-17A, indicating that isoleucine exacerbates Th17 activation in a lipid-rich environment. In the combined treatment groups, no enhancement was observed at 25 mg isoleucine, but significant colocalization and intensified fluorescence emerged at 50 mg. However, no further increase was observed at 100 mg, suggesting a potential plateau or saturation in immune activation.</p><p>Oil Red O staining revealed hepatic lipid accumulation patterns. No visible lipid droplets were detected in Ctrl + Ile groups, indicating preserved hepatic lipid homeostasis. In contrast, HFD + Ile groups exhibited prominent red lipid droplets with increased size and density, indicating that isoleucine did not mitigate HFD-induced steatosis. Notably, in the combined HFD + AFB1 groups, the 25 mg isoleucine group showed extensive lipid accumulation, while the 50 and 100 mg groups displayed markedly smaller droplet size despite persistent density, suggesting that isoleucine may modulate lipid metabolism under toxic stress conditions.</p><p>In summary, isoleucine demonstrated a dual modulatory effect under combined HFD and AFB1 exposure. While mid- and high-dose isoleucine exacerbated hepatic steatosis and Th17 inflammation under HFD conditions, it conferred partial protection against lipid accumulation and hepatic structural damage in the presence of AFB1.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot10-nutrients-17-02897"><title>3.10. Modulatory Effects of Isoleucine Under Different Nutritional and Toxicological Contexts</title><p>To examine the dose-dependent effects of isoleucine on liver function and lipid metabolism under varying dietary and toxicological conditions, serum biochemical parameters were assessed in nine groups (<xref rid="nutrients-17-02897-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>A&#8211;E). Under HFD conditions, a significant increase in ALT was observed in the 50 mg/kg isoleucine group compared to both 25 and 100 mg/kg groups (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.01), while no significant dose-dependent differences were detected in AST levels across the HFD + Ile groups. In contrast, under HFD + AFB1 conditions, ALT levels in the 50 mg/kg Ile group were significantly lower than those in the 100 mg/kg group (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), with no significant changes in AST levels among doses.</p><p>ALB levels remained consistent (30&#8211;38 g/L) across all groups, with no significant intragroup differences. Regarding lipid metabolism, TC levels were significantly higher in the HFD + Ile50 compared to Ile25 and Ile100 groups (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), suggesting a dose-responsive increase. Conversel, no significant dose-dependent differences in TC were observed in the Ctrl or HFD + AFB1 backgrounds. For TG, significant reductions were observed in the HFD + AFB1 + Ile50 and Ile100 groups compared to the HFD + AFB1 + Ile25 group (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), while no significant changes were found within either the Ctrl or HFD groups.</p><p>As illustrated in <xref rid="nutrients-17-02897-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>F&#8211;H, isoleucine supplementation exerted dose-dependent effects on oxidative stress markers under all dietary backgrounds. In the control group, increasing isoleucine doses significantly reduced GSH and SOD levels while elevating MDA levels, indicating impaired antioxidant capacity and enhanced lipid peroxidation. Similar patterns were observed under HFD conditions, where GSH and SOD were markedly depleted in the Ile50 and Ile100 groups, and MDA levels significantly increased. Under combined HFD and AFB1 exposure, isoleucine supplementation further exacerbated oxidative imbalance: GSH and SOD were significantly reduced at higher doses, while MDA accumulation was notably enhanced. Collectively, these findings suggest that under normal, HFD and AFB1 stress conditions, isoleucine induces oxidative stress in a dose-responsive manner.</p><p>In <xref rid="nutrients-17-02897-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>I&#8211;K, under normal chow conditions, isoleucine also demonstrated a clear dose-dependent effect, with 50 and 100 mg/kg treatments increasing IL-6 levels to 616.14 &#177; 29.48 pg/mL (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and 791.81 &#177; 24.43 pg/mL (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), respectively. Under HFD conditions, even a low dose of isoleucine (25 mg/kg) significantly elevated IL-6 expression (683.76 &#177; 41.78 pg/mL, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Notably, IL-6 levels surged further to 1303.60 &#177; 38.67 pg/mL in the HFD + AFB1 + Ile50 group (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), indicating a strong synergistic proinflammatory effect under triple exposure. A similar pattern was observed for IL-22 and TGF-&#946;, particularly in the co-treatment groups. In the HFD + AFB1 + Ile100 group, IL-22 levels reached 859.87 &#177; 21.94 pg/mL and TGF-&#946; levels increased to 236.44 &#177; 15.26 pg/mL-representing respective increases of 236% and 62% compared to the Ctrl + Ile25 group. These findings suggest that medium and high doses of Ile, particularly in the presence of HFD and AFB1, significantly upregulate serum proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines. This implies a potential immunostimulatory risk associated with isoleucine supplementation under metabolically stressful conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-nutrients-17-02897"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>AFB1 and HFD are recognized as typical toxicological and nutritional risk factors in modern dietary patterns [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Using a murine model, we systematically assessed the individual and combined effects of AFB1 and HFD, along with graded isoleucine supplementation, across multiple physiological domains including metabolic parameters, hepatic function, inflammatory responses, oxidative stress markers, and gut microbiota composition. The results reveal distinct interaction patterns and underlying mechanisms of these factors under varying nutritional and toxicological conditions.</p><sec id="sec4dot1-nutrients-17-02897"><title>4.1.

Under this metabolic burden, moderate-dose isoleucine supplementation (50 mg/kg) further aggravated immunometabolic imbalance, as evidenced by elevated proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-17), depletion of antioxidant defenses (GSH, SOD), and increased lipid peroxidation (MDA), constituting a characteristic &#8220;metabolic&#8211;inflammatory phenotype&#8221; [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Interestingly, under combined HFD and AFB1 conditions, moderate-to-high dose isoleucine supplementation (50&#8211;100 mg/kg) demonstrated a protective effect against hepatic structural damage and reduced lipid droplet size compared to low-dose supplementation (25 mg/kg), though it did not significantly affect TC levels.

This confirmed that AFB1 and HFD independently promote Th17 expansion, and their co-exposure has a synergistic effect on Th17-mediated inflammation. In the intervention phase, isoleucine supplementation showed context-dependent effects. Under HFD, mid- and high-dose isoleucine (50&#8211;100 mg/kg) exacerbated hepatic steatosis and Th17-mediated inflammation.

Microbiota Dysbiosis, Barrier Disruption, and Gut&#8211;Liver Axis Perturbation</title><p>16S rRNA sequencing revealed that co-exposure to AFB1 and HFD significantly reduced &#945;-diversity and enriched proinflammatory genera such as <italic toggle="yes">Bilophila</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Oscillospira</italic>, while depleting beneficial commensals such as <italic toggle="yes">Akkermansia</italic>-especially in the AFB1 + HFD group. This microbial imbalance was accompanied by decreased expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin, indicating compromised intestinal barrier integrity. These changes coincided with increased inflammatory cytokines and oxidative markers, suggesting a self-reinforcing cycle involving dysbiosis, barrier disruption, and systemic inflammation. Previous studies have shown that both AFB1 and HFD independently impair gut microbial composition, increase intestinal permeability, and promote systemic inflammation via LPS-mediated activation of the TLR4&#8211;NF-&#954;B axis [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Mechanistic Implications of Dose&#8211;Environment Dependency of Isoleucine</title><p>Under normal dietary conditions, isoleucine induced dose-dependent increases in inflammatory markers and oxidative stress despite minimal metabolic changes. In HFD contexts, moderate-dose isoleucine (50 mg/kg) specifically exacerbated hepatic injury, as evidenced by peak ALT elevation compared to lower and higher doses. Notably, under combined HFD and AFB1 exposure, isoleucine exhibited a dual modulatory pattern: while 50 mg/kg intensified inflammatory responses (IL-6: 1303.60 pg/mL, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), higher doses (100 mg/kg) reduced triglycerides compared to 50 mg/kg, suggesting context-dependent activation of protective mechanisms. Histological analyses corroborated these findings, revealing hepatic structural recovery at 50&#8211;100 mg/kg doses despite persistent intestinal damage. Previous study indicates that HFD amplifies amino acid-induced metabolic dysregulation, while AFB1 exposure enhances oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity, which may trigger endogenous protective mechanisms [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nutrients-17-02897" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

This finding is especially valuable for designing targeted nutritional intervention strategies for high-risk populations with metabolic abnormalities and potential toxin exposure (e.g., certain occupational groups or individuals with unbalanced diets and exposure to AFB1-contaminated environments), as well as for exploring the &#8220;double-edged sword&#8221; effect of branched-chain amino acids in liver injury progression.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-nutrients-17-02897"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates that HFD serves as the primary metabolic disruptor, while low-dose AFB1 alone exerts minimal effects. Their combination, however, synergistically disrupts gut&#8211;liver axis homeostasis through intestinal barrier impairment, oxidative stress amplification, and Th17-mediated inflammation. Gut microbiota analysis confirms HFD as the dominant driver of dysbiosis, with AFB1 + HFD intensifying the depletion of protective taxa like <italic toggle="yes">Akkermansia</italic>. Metabolomic and functional validation identified isoleucine as a key inflammatory biomarker that promotes IL-17A<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation. Crucially, isoleucine exhibits context-dependent duality: exacerbating pathology under HFD conditions while paradoxically attenuating hepatic lipid accumulation at moderate/high doses under AFB1 + HFD exposure. These findings establish that isoleucine functions as a double-edged sword&#8212;amplifying metabolic inflammation in lipid-rich environments while potentially activating compensatory pathways under combined toxicant exposure. The results underscore the critical importance of environmental context in determining functional amino acid effects, necessitating condition-specific safety evaluations for nutritional interventions in metabolically compromised individuals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Tianjin Guosheng Zhongyuan Technology Co., Ltd. for providing the animal experiment platform and technical assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
