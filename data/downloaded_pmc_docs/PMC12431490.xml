This study aims to explore the multi-level barriers and enablers of T1DM care in Karnataka state, providing evidence-based recommendations for policymakers to improve healthcare services. This qualitative study employed in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussion (FGDs) with multiple stakeholders, including ten People with Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus (PwT1DM) aged 5&#8211;23 years and their caregivers, 13 Healthcare providers (HCPs) -Endocrinologists, paediatricians, diabetes educators, and primary care physicians; and ten senior health officials and six Policymakers. Participants were selected using purposive sampling from both urban and rural settings across Karnataka. Data was collected over six months, and qualitative research software was used to analyse the transcribed data thematically. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of M.S. Ramaiah Medical College. Significant obstacles include inadequate integration of policies within India&#8217;s national framework, erratic insulin availability, substantial out-of-pocket costs, and insufficient training for healthcare providers. Rural demographics face compounded disadvantages due to poor healthcare infrastructure, while caregivers, especially mothers, struggle with financial and emotional burdens; People with TIDM endure social stigma and mental health issues, particularly affecting females. The study highlights the critical need for formulating dedicated T1DM policies within the framework of the existing Non-Communicable Disease program. Implementation of&#160;subsidized&#160;insulin schemes and expansion of primary care services, along with a multi-sectoral strategy, encompassing enhanced training for HCPs, integration of digital health solutions, and development of community-based support systems, is essential for effective and sustainable T1DM management. Addressing financial and gender-based disparities is crucial to ensure equitable care in both urban and rural areas.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="19"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Excerpts from the transcripts of this qualitative research have been made available within the article.

The global prevalence of T1DM is projected to increase from 8.4 million in 2021 to 13.5 -17.4 million by 2040, reflecting a 60&#8211;170% increase. In a decade, the estimated number of children with T1DM in India increased 2.35 times to 229,400 (0&#8211;19 years) in 2021 [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

The regional prevalence rates in India vary significantly; while Karnataka reports 17.93, Chennai and Karnal (Haryana) report 3.2 and 10.2 T1DM per 100,000, respectively [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The Karnataka Diabetes Registry (1995&#8211;2008) records various complications for persons with T1DM (PwT1DM), including severe hypoglycaemia, as well as microvascular and macrovascular issues [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. PwT1DM often face workplace discrimination, struggle to balance health and work, have higher rates of absenteeism, and tend to retire earlier [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, T1DM causes increased adversity and distress throughout life [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], affecting life opportunities [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], marriage prospects, family planning, and social interactions due to stigma and inadequate care, especially impacting young adults and women [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In children with T1DM, school absenteeism and poorer academic performance are reported [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Also, a recent meta-analysis shows that youth with T1DM are less physically active and more sedentary than their non-diabetic peers [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nearly one in five students with T1DM in India are prevented from participating in sports or excursions [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Such school environments and social exclusion result in long-term socioeconomic and health disadvantages for these young individuals [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In Karnataka, as in many parts of India, inadequate screening and delayed and ineffective management of T1DM are worsened by health systems that focus more on curative measures than on integrated, patient-centred approaches. Yet, there is a critical research gap in understanding the contextual burden, cultural expectations, and financial vulnerabilities associated with T1DM. Specifically, there is limited data examining how individuals and families navigate T1DM care in LMIC settings [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To address the research gap, we undertook a multi-level exploration of barriers and enablers to T1DM care in Karnataka. Our aim was twofold: first, to elucidate how social determinants and healthcare policies converge to impact disease management; second, to provide pragmatic recommendations for improving T1DM services within India&#8217;s evolving Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) landscape. By highlighting these systemic and&#160;psycho-social&#160;factors, we underscore the need for reforms that extend beyond insulin provision to a more inclusive model of diabetes care, one that acknowledges local realities and bolsters support for patients and caregivers alike.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study setting and design</title><p>This study was conducted in Karnataka, India, and examined challenges and responses to T1DM through multi-stakeholder engagement. This study employed a qualitative research design, utilizing in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) over six months to explore the experiences, challenges, and perspectives of key stakeholders involved in T1DM management. FGDs were conducted at clinical facilities when feasible, which encouraged dynamic exchanges revealing shared perspectives. However, due to the sensitive nature of personal challenges and emotional burdens are often less shared in groups, IDIs provided a private setting for deeper, personal sharing. While both explored similar themes, FGDs focused on shared experiences, and IDIs on individual views. No participants overlapped between the two methods.</p><p>Using purposive sampling, we aimed to include participants with diverse backgrounds and experiences. For PwT1DM and caregivers, we considered variations in age, gender, place of residence (rural or urban), and duration since diagnosis. For healthcare providers and policymakers, we included a mix of professional roles, facility types (primary, secondary, tertiary), and administrative levels (district and state). This diverse representation of participants enabled us to capture the complexity of challenges and responses related to T1DM across different settings and roles. Data collection continued until thematic saturation was achieved, which was assessed iteratively. Saturation was considered reached when no new themes emerged in at least two consecutive interviews within each participant group, and responses began to repeat. The research team jointly reviewed this process to ensure consistency and depth across stakeholder groups. Participants were recruited between November 15, 2023, and April 15, 2024, based on their availability and the convenience of scheduling.</p><p>An interview and FGD guide (<xref rid="pgph.0005129.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>), developed in alignment with the study objectives, included open-ended questions to explore T1DM management strategies, personal challenges, systemic barriers, and policy gaps. FGDs were conducted only with PwT1DM and caregivers, as it was feasible to mobilize them in group settings and capture commonly shared experiences. In-depth interviews were used alongside FGDs to explore more personal or sensitive issues. For healthcare providers, policymakers, and senior officials, only in-depth interviews were conducted, as group discussions were not practical due to logistical constraints and the&#160;individualized&#160;nature of their roles.</p><p>Pilot testing was done to clarify and assess the relevance. Interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted in Kannada, the local language, and subsequently translated into English for analysis and interpretation. Bilingual team members reviewed translations to ensure accuracy and contextual relevance. The interviews and FGDs were facilitated by trained qualitative researchers from the study team, who had no prior relationship with the participants. This helped maintain professional neutrality and reduce bias in the data collection process.</p><p>All sessions were held in private and quiet locations, such as hospital consultation rooms, health facilities, office meeting halls, or community centers, depending on participant convenience and to ensure confidentiality. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and sessions were audio-recorded, supplemented with field notes that captured non-verbal cues and contextual nuances. For participants who were unable to read and write, the researchers explained the research work in detail in their local language, and after clarifying their doubts, written informed consent was obtained.</p><p>The research team brought together diverse professional perspectives, including those of a public health researcher, a clinician, and an adolescent student researcher&#8212;this multidisciplinary composition enriched data interpretation by incorporating varied lenses. In many cases, shared professional or lived experiences with certain participant groups helped establish trust and rapport, facilitating more open and in-depth discussions. To complement this strength and ensure balanced perspectives, interviews and FGDs were conducted by an independent trained qualitative researcher with no prior professional relationships with participants, enabling both respectful engagement and methodological rigor. In this study, we used two types of triangulations to improve the credibility and richness of our results. First, data source triangulation involved the collection of perspectives from different stakeholder groups, including individuals with type 1 diabetes (PwT1DM), caregivers, healthcare providers, and policymakers. This approach helped us compare and verify insights from various experiences. Second, investigator triangulation was applied by team members from different disciplinary backgrounds who independently coded the data and developed themes, thereby increasing the rigor of our interpretation.

Findings are&#160;categorized&#160;into five key themes: structural and policy-level determinants, health system capacities and service delivery constraints, patient and caregiver burden, provider and health workforce perspectives, and Emerging solutions and policy implications. Each theme is examined through a lens of contextual realities, linking individual experiences to broader systemic inefficiencies and identifying pathways for improvement.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Structural and policy-level determinants</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Limited policy integration and financial protection</title><p>Participants, particularly policymakers and health providers, reported that T1DM remains a low-priority issue within both national and state health policy frameworks. They pointed out that, while the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NPNCD) seeks to strengthen NCD care, its emphasis is largely on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), leaving the distinct needs of PwT1DM unaddressed. According to participants, unlike other NCDs, there is no strong policy framework to ensure uninterrupted access to insulin and monitoring tools, partly due to the lack of structured funding for T1DM. They attributed this low prioritization to the limited visibility of T1DM cases in routine health system data and a widespread perception that it affects relatively fewer people, especially children, making it less urgent for national-level attention.</p><p>Moreover, participants noted that state-led subsidy programs for insulin and glucose monitoring supplies are available in certain regions. However, they reported inconsistent implementation across districts, citing factors such as lack of awareness among healthcare staff, irregular supply chains, and delays in fund disbursement. Some participants also expressed concern that, despite the existence of such schemes, frontline providers and patients were often unaware of them, limiting their reach and effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Cost barriers and regional disparities</title><p>The cost of insulin and glucose monitoring devices has emerged as one of the most pressing barriers, with families reporting that they spend 30&#8211;50% of their income on diabetes care. Frequent insulin stock-outs in public hospitals force patients to buy expensive, unregulated medicines from private pharmacies.</p><p>A caregiver from a lower-income household shared that &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">the Government hospitals provide insulin only in limited stock, and there is no guarantee it will be available when we need it. We have to buy it from private pharmacies, which cost almost half of my monthly income.</italic>&#8221;</p><p>Un-affordability&#160;leads to insulin rationing, especially in lower-income households. A participant acknowledged, <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;We sometimes reduce the insulin dose to make it last longer because we can&#8217;t always afford to buy more.&#8221;</italic> Participants also noted that such practices disrupted glycemic control and sometimes led to health complications that required emergency care.</p><p>These financial burdens are compounded by geographical disparities in healthcare access, where rural and semi-urban areas often lack&#160;specialized&#160;diabetes clinics and endocrinologists. Participants reported that PwT1DM often travel 80&#8211;100 km or more to reach tertiary hospitals, often on a monthly basis. For children, caregivers shared that this requires missing school and parents losing daily wages or taking leave from work, which adds further economic strain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Health system capacities and service delivery constraints</title><p>Findings from this study highlight significant health system barriers that restrict access to timely and high-quality care for PwT1DM in India.</p><sec id="sec011"><title>Insufficient insulin supply and diagnostic services</title><p>The irregular supply of insulin in government hospitals, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas, remains a persistent challenge, forcing PwT1DM to turn to private pharmacies, which are often expensive. This financial burden results in irregular insulin use and poor glycaemia control, increasing the risk of diabetes-related emergencies such as DKA.</p><p>A district hospital physician noted that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;We receive insulin in unpredictable batches. When supplies run out, PwT1DM has to buy them from outside, which many cannot afford. We need a better system to ensure a continuous and predictable stock of insulin.&#8221;</italic></p><p>Many PwT1DM receive HbA1c tests and continuous glucose monitoring devices, glucose testing only during emergency visits, rather than as part of routine diabetes management, increasing the likelihood of&#160;hospitalizations. The use of regular HbA1c tests and continuous monitoring devices is often a rare phenomenon due to financial constraints and a lack of awareness. These are often tested on patients only during emergency situations and are not part of regular monitoring activity.</p><p>A government health official highlighted that &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">We focus on immediate treatment rather than long-term management. Without regular monitoring tools like HbA1c tests, we are treating diabetes blindly, which leads to complications</italic>.&#8221;</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>rural-urban disparities and health infrastructure gaps</title><p>The geographical disparity in diabetes care is another major health system constraint, particularly for rural populations, where&#160;specialized&#160;diabetes clinics and endocrinologists&#8217; care are extremely limited. Associated transportation costs, wage loss, and logistical challenges lead to missed appointments and inconsistent treatment.</p><p>A mother from a remote village shared her frustration that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;For fever or infections, we visit the local clinic, but for my child&#8217;s diabetes, we must travel to the city. The cost of transport is almost as much as the medicine itself. Sometimes we skip appointments because we just can&#8217;t afford to go.&#8221;</italic> Another caregiver echoed this concern: <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;My husband has to miss work to accompany us to the hospital. That means two days without wages. We try to combine visits, but that&#8217;s not always possible with diabetes.&#8221;</italic> These constraints often result in delays in insulin administration, missed follow-ups, and irregular glucose monitoring. A young girl with T1DM added: <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;We wait until it&#8217;s really bad before going to the city. Otherwise, it&#8217;s just too expensive and tiring.&#8221;</italic></p><p>A Doctor working in a rural PHC acknowledged that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;We see very few TIDM cases, and most of us are more familiar with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Without endocrinologists, we do our best, but sometimes, by the time a child reaches a specialised centre, their condition has worsened.&#8221;</italic></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>PwT1DM and caregiver burden</title><p>Managing T1DM is not just a medical challenge. It deeply affects families&#8217; economic stability, emotional well-being, and social inclusion. The chronic nature of the disease, high treatment costs, and daily self-management demands place significant burdens on PwT1DM and caregivers. This burden is particularly pronounced among lower-income families and women, who face financial hardships, gender-based discrimination, and social stigma that impact access to care.</p><sec id="sec014"><title>Economic and psychological strain on families</title><p>Families often must&#160;prioritize&#160;medical expenses over other household needs, affecting the education and well-being of non-diabetic siblings. Many caregivers, particularly mothers, are forced to quit their jobs or reduce their working hours to provide full-time care.</p><p>A mother of a T1DM adolescent shared that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;I had to leave my job because my son needs constant care. Now, we are struggling financially, and sometimes I worry about whether we will have enough money to buy his next insulin dose.&#8221;</italic></p><p>A parent shared that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;The diagnosis was shocking. It took us a while to accept that our daughter would need daily insulin for the rest of her life. We had to quickly learn how to administer insulin and plan meals around her condition.&#8221;</italic></p><p>The psychological burden of T1DM extends to children and adolescents, who frequently experience anxiety, self-blame, and social isolation due to their dietary restrictions and dependence on insulin. A 14-year-old boy with T1DM stated, &#8220;I <italic toggle="yes">feel guilty every time my parents struggle to buy my medicines. Sometimes, I think it would be easier if I weren&#8217;t sick.&#8221;</italic></p><p>The financial and emotional burden on families emphasizes the critical need for systematic interventions, such as incorporating social protection schemes, to ensure accessible and affordable T1DM care.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Gendered barriers and social stigma</title><p>A girl shared that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;My family told me not to talk about my condition outside because they were afraid that I wouldn&#8217;t find a husband.&#8221;</italic> Even when she needed medical care, her family hesitated to take her to the hospital. This reflected a broader pattern among families, particularly in rural and traditional settings, where concern around marital prospects led to silence or secrecy about girls&#8217; health conditions.</p><p>These gendered restrictive norms limit the educational and career opportunities, either discouraging them from pursuing higher studies or a job.</p><p>Another PwT1DM expressed that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;I wanted to study further, but my parents said managing diabetes would be too difficult if I moved to another city for college.&#8221;</italic></p><p>Families often&#160;prioritize&#160;the medical needs of male members over girls, leading to inadequate or delayed care. A caregiver admitted that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;We try to manage her condition at home because taking her to the doctor frequently is difficult. We have to think about our son&#8217;s future, too.&#8221;</italic></p><p>These gendered barriers have severe implications for girls&#8217; reproductive health, mental well-being, and long-term independence, especially in traditional and rural communities. These social stigma leads to isolation, bullying, and discrimination for PwT1DM in school and workplaces.</p><p>A 19-year-old college student with T1DM noted that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;During exams, I needed to take breaks to check my sugar levels, but my teachers thought I was making excuses. I stopped asking for help because I didn&#8217;t want to be treated differently.&#8221;</italic> The impact of mental health on discrimination and social stigma is profound, with studies showing that adolescents with T1DM exhibit a twofold elevated probability of developing anxiety and depressive disorders compared to their non-diabetic peers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Provider and health workforce perspectives</title><p>Knowledge and Capacity Gaps: Health Care professionals (HCPs) play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of T1DM; nevertheless, systemic challenges, including insufficient training, misdiagnosis, lack of standardized treatment protocols, and workforce deficiencies, hinder their ability to provide qualitative, patient-centered care. These challenges are particularly pronounced in resource-constrained ecosystems, such as rural and semi-urban areas of India, where specialist services are not readily available at the Primary Health Centre (PHC) level.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Limited training and misdiagnosis risks</title><p>One of the issues in medical education curricula is the inadequate emphasis on T1DM. While T2DM is extensively covered in medical curricula due to its high prevalence in India, T1DM is under considered, which leaves the General practitioners (GPs) and primary-care physicians in the country&#160;under trained&#160;and ill-equipped to diagnose and treat T1DM cases accurately.</p><p>A Physician from a government district hospital admitted that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;In medical school, we learned a lot about T2DM, but T1DM was barely covered. Many of us rely on general knowledge, which may not always be enough. This may lead to misdiagnoses, especially in young children.&#8221;</italic></p><p>Consequently, this knowledge gap may lead to inappropriate use of oral medication in place of insulin, which may result in late initiation of correct treatment. In addition, a lack of standard treatment guidelines may result in poor glycaemia control and trigger complications such as DKA, which may add to the financial burden on families. Also, early symptoms of T1DM, like increased thirst, frequent urination, and weight loss, often mimic Tuberculosis and urinary tract infections in regions where these are of high prevalence.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Gaps in PwT1DM counselling and long-term care</title><p>Even if an accurate diagnosis is made, the provision of comprehensive, patient-centric T1DM care is hindered by gaps within the healthcare system.

Sustainable interventions addressing affordability and accessibility throughout the continuum of care should be explored, especially for marginalized populations affected by healthcare inequities. This section examines the key emerging solutions for enhancing T1DM care and improving long-term outcomes.</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Perspectives on state-subsidized insulin programs</title><p>One of the most impactful and immediate solutions is the implementation of state-subsidized insulin programs to reduce the financial burden on families. According to a few respondents, some Indian states have piloted such initiatives by ensuring the availability of free or subsidised insulin in public hospitals. While these efforts reflect an attempt toward universal access, participants noted that they remain limited in both scope and consistency of implementation across the states.</p><p>A policymaker emphasised the importance of scaling such initiatives at the national level, stating, <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;We have seen successful state-level programs making insulin affordable, but we need a national-level strategy to ensure uniform access.&#8221;</italic></p><p>Participants suggested that a nationally coordinated insulin subsidy could be integrated into Ayushman Bharat, a public health insurance scheme, ensuring PwT1DM consistent access to insulin, especially from lower-income backgrounds.

According to respondents, most PHCs lack trained endocrinologists or medical officers who are adequately trained in T1DM, making diabetes care primarily inaccessible to rural populations. One policy stakeholder noted, <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;We cannot expect rural patients to travel long distances to tertiary hospitals for routine diabetes care. Strengthening PHCs is the only way to ensure continuity of treatment&#8221;.</italic> A healthcare administrator highlighted that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;We have seen how CHWs have been instrumental in TB and HIV programs.

Some healthcare providers have noted that mobile health (mHealth) applications and telemedicine platforms can support routine monitoring and improve access to specialists. One healthcare professional stated, <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;Telemedicine can help bridge the gap for patients in remote areas who struggle to access specialised care.&#8221;</italic></p><p>Other suggestions included the use of automated reminders for insulin doses and digital health education modules to enhance adherence and self-monitoring, especially among adolescents. However, these ideas were accompanied by concern around feasibility.</p><p>A policy stakeholder highlighted that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;While digital tools have great potential, we need better training and support systems for both patients and HCPs to ensure effective implementation&#8221;.</italic> Participants also identified challenges, including inadequate digital infrastructure in rural areas, low smartphone ownership, and the additional cost burden that may arise from mobile data usage or accessing telehealth platforms. These findings suggest a balance of optimism and caution in adopting digital interventions, with stakeholders emphasizing the need for low-cost, user-friendly platforms that are tailored to the realities of low-resource settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Stakeholder views on policy integration: embedding T1DM in national health programs</title><p>This study highlights a critical policy gap in India&#8217;s healthcare framework, as T1DM remains largely unaddressed in the NPNCD, unlike T2DM.</p><p>A policy stakeholder noted that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;T1DM is often overlooked in national programs, leaving patients without essential support for insulin access and regular monitoring.&#8221;</italic></p><p>HCPs emphasized the need for the expansion of NPNCD to explicitly include T1DM-specific care, with a dedicated budgetary allocation for insulin and glucose monitoring services in public health facilities.</p><p>One caregiver, expressing frustration over the financial burden, said, <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;We have to pay out of pocket for every test and insulin refill.

The results highlight that T1DM is a silent burden affecting families, yet it is obscured by policy and implementation frameworks despite its profound clinical implications [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our research aligns with existing evidence that highlights fragmented health systems, inadequate policy focus, and significant budgetary strain, thereby exacerbating inequities in healthcare services for PwT1DM [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The shared realities, as reported by research participants&#8212;PwT1DMs, caregivers, HCPs, and policymakers &#8212;show that T1DM, as a medical illness, reflects only the tip of the iceberg of a rather profound socioeconomic and psychological burden on families and the healthcare system [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>We have identified that inadequate policy integration and funding hinder the care of PwT1DM. While Karnataka&#8217;s health officials are eager to promote initiatives for T1DM, the lack of a cohesive national strategy prioritising this issue has led to several inconsistencies in accessing insulin, diagnostic services, and patient education. India&#8217;s NCD program, launched in 2008, is adult-centric and excludes T1DM. The reliance on national mandates to implement health programmes has historically challenged the health system in numerous states, despite health being primarily a state responsibility [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Only in recent years have NCDs begun to receive the attention they merit, due to ongoing review and guidance from the public health community [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Hence, it would be premature to assert that other NCD programmes overshadow T1DM care, particularly when they grapple with significant challenges such as inadequate screening and coverage gaps. The recurrent insulin shortages and the strain of high out-of-pocket costs highlight the urgent necessity to incorporate T1DM into NPNCD and publicly funded health insurance schemes, potentially drawing lessons from successful government-funded initiatives for other chronic diseases [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Efforts to integrate regulated pricing for insulin and manage the supply chain effectively can help alleviate the burdens faced by families. Furthermore, bolstering essential diagnostic services and reimbursing out-of-pocket expenses can help mitigate daily wage losses, thereby advancing the stated objective of universal health coverage [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In India, 38% of Indian households with diabetic members&#8217; experience catastrophic health expenditure, and approximately 10% of DM&#8208;affected households are pushed below the poverty line because of Out of pocket expenditure (OOPE). The financial hardships faced by PwT1DM often result in health costs exceeding the threshold of 10% of household consumption and greater than 40% of non-subsistence income [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. More than 30% of families with T1DM children spend over half their income on health care; such spendings are often done through distressed financing, pushing households into poverty and highlighting the extreme vulnerability of managing chronic diseases in low-resource settings [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Our research shows how health system weaknesses and service delivery challenges extend beyond material shortages [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The gap between urban and rural regions, along with the scarcity of trained specialists and diabetes educators, significantly hampers the continuity of care. Rural caregivers face substantial logistical and financial challenges in accessing tertiary centres for routine check-ups and managing urgent complications. This distance disrupts timely and consistent care delivery, increasing the risk of severe complications. Additionally, primary care providers often point out their inadequate training related to T1DM, revealing that gaps in knowledge and lack of familiarity with paediatric diabetes management can lead to misdiagnoses, unnecessary delays, and inappropriate treatments like oral medications. Addressing these capacity issues is essential for reducing preventable hospitalisations and fostering early, precise management tactics.</p><p>Our findings reveal that families, particularly mothers, face significant burdens due to social stigma, gender inequities, and economic vulnerability [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Mothers often navigate uncertainty and anxiety while balancing strict insulin schedules and dietary plans with domestic responsibilities and financial constraints [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Adolescents themselves confront psychosocial challenges, such as bullying at school, social isolation, and discrimination in marriage or employment, all of which can undermine adherence and quality of life [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In more conservative settings, the stigma associated with chronic illness can particularly marginalise girls, limiting their educational and personal development [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, patriarchal norms and gender-related stigma surrounding marriageability promote concealment and delay in the treatment of T1DM among adolescent girls, which contribute to emotional distress and negative health outcomes [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although rarely addressed in clinical treatment protocols, these social determinants shape disease progression and outcomes.</p><p>In addition to the medical complications, T1DM imposes several socioeconomic challenges on the families, disrupting education and leading to caregiver stress and financial insecurity. Our results show that families faced significant geographic disadvantage, often having to travel long distances to seek T1DM care. This aligns with evidence indicating that travel costs and time are substantial burdens in diabetes management. These trips frequently cause children to miss school and parents to lose work hours, which can impact household income [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Often, indirect costs like lost wages are significant and impact many caregivers who forgo earnings to take their child to the clinic [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Evidence indicates that families sell assets or cut expenses, such as siblings&#8217; education, to afford insulin and supplies [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our findings on insulin rationing and delayed care-seeking predict severe medical consequences, as supported by the literature [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These results align with other evidence indicating inequities in T1DM care in rural primary healthcare settings [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Consequently, delayed referrals and complications affect PwT1DM [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Inadequate insulin leads to acute metabolic crises; even short lapses can cause life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Many patients in resource-limited settings experience recurrent DKA or early death when insulin is unaffordable [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. PwT1DM in LMICs are at the risk of premature complications and preventable mortality due to limited access to quality healthcare and the extended periods of high glucose levels. A survey in Odisha revealed that only 20% of health centers have a functioning glucometer, forcing patients to travel far for diagnostics [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The complications in the eyes, kidneys, and nerves require advanced care, which again is a limitation in these settings [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. For example, 37% of the children with T1DM presented with Diabetic Ketoacidosis when they presented to the health system, and this was significantly associated with lower per-capita income and treatment gap [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Maintaining healthy blood glucose levels by reducing treatment delays and enhancing insulin access can minimize life-threatening complications and mortality [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Consequently, any strategy to improve T1DM care must be culturally sensitive, incorporating medical care, psychological, and social support into standard clinical practice and community outreach efforts [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].&#160;Participants from various stakeholder groups identified promising avenues for policy and programme innovation. Firstly, scaling up state-subsidized insulin programmes and price regulation measures would substantially alleviate the financial burden on caregivers and enhance adherence. Secondly, a task-shifting model&#8212;where primary health workers, nurses, and accredited social health activists (ASHAs) receive targeted training &#8212; could aid in decentralizing T1DM care and reducing dependence on overstretched tertiary centers. Thirdly, digital health interventions can provide tele-consultation and monitoring services for T1DM, especially in remote areas. While user training and infrastructure concerns persist, well-designed mobile applications and virtual follow-up systems can bridge knowledge gaps, facilitate dose adjustments, and connect PwT1DM with specialist care without excessive travel costs. Lastly, the emotional strain on both families and frontline providers underscores the need to more concretely integrate mental health services and peer-support networks into diabetes programmes. The success of community-based group models, where PwT1DMs and caregivers share knowledge and coping strategies, illustrates the power of collective empowerment in alleviating stigma and burnout.</p><p>Youth in health programs should be viewed as more than mere beneficiaries and instead should be engaged as equal and integral partners in projects and research. This is endorsed by best practices in research as well as the Global Consensus Statement on Meaningful Adolescent and Youth Engagement [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The engagement of youth helps ensure that interventions are developmentally appropriate and grounded in the real challenges youths face in low-resource settings [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. For instance, balancing T1DM management with school, as documented in LMIC contexts, is well contextualized by youth participation [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The student&#8217;s involvement in the study fostered empathy, seen as a hopeful shift towards youth participation in health research. Engaging students in our study promoted inclusion; the co-creation of knowledge with researchers and policymakers strengthens the trust needed in qualitative inquiry. Case studies from several LMICs show that youth-led research led to feasible, contextually specific, age-appropriate, and culturally relevant interventions [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Early involvement enhances the impact and expands the influence of youth on health research, relating to their lived experiences and those of their peers, and promotes their participation in health programs [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In systems that overlook young voices, youth-led inquiry serves as a form of advocacy, involving listening, learning, and voicing hopes aloud. Also, it fosters optimism among policymakers and clinicians [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Our study emphasizes the significance of youth engagement in research and health programs, aligning with global efforts to ensure adolescents&#8217; rights to participate in decisions that affect them [<xref rid="pgph.0005129.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p><p>There were some limitations in our study, as the likelihood of PwT1DM accessing care from the alternative system of medicine and those on irregular medical care would have been missed, since our participants were those seeking allopathic treatment. The barriers and challenges of these could be more diversified, which would shed more light. While structural issues were emphasised, individual-level behavioural aspects affecting T1DM management, such as self-care practices, were less explored. Policymakers included in the study had limited direct experience with T1DM, which may have affected the depth of policy-related insights. While the representation of PwT1DM from urban and rural areas was addressed, the representation of PwT1DM from tribal areas was not included. However, given the situation of tribal areas, similar to challenges faced in rural areas, the results would not be grossly different and could not have greatly impacted the findings of our study. Despite these limitations, the rigorous methodology enables this study to be conceptually transferable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec029"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings underscore the pressing need for context-specific, evidence-based, and equity-driven reforms in integrating T1DM management into state and national programs. The neglect of care for PwT1DM should be reversed by inclusion in the NPNCD. Our findings suggest that strengthening primary healthcare systems for NCD care can ensure sustained support for PwT1DM and their caregivers. Our study indicates that contextually specific, tailored interventions-particularly those addressing issues related to stigma, gender, and economic hardship that are necessary to establish a robust system capable of managing the lifelong challenges of T1DM. By prioritising the voices of those most affected, policymakers and healthcare leaders can develop a holistic model of T1DM care that not only minimises clinical complications but also alleviates the significant emotional and financial burden on families. The successful implementation of such strategies in Karnataka may serve as a model for other regions facing similar structural and social challenges, thereby making a meaningful contribution to global efforts toward equitable diabetes care.</p></sec><sec id="sec030" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pgph.0005129.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Summary of the results from Multi-Level Exploration of Barriers and Enablers in Type 1 Diabetes Care in Karnataka, India.</title><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0005129.s001.tiff" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0005129.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Guide for IDI and FGD.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0005129.s002.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0005129.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Codebook.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0005129.s003.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0005129.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Excerpts from qualitative transcripts.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0005129.s004.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0005129.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>Inclusivity in global research questionnaire.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0005129.s005.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors sincerely acknowledge the valuable contributions of all participants who consented and participated in the research, for their time and experiences.
