The aim was to study the genetic diversity and relationship of IC from Bugesera and Rwamagana districts with SASSO chickens in Rwanda. Eighty-seven DNA samples were genotyped using Diversity Array Technology and generated 45,677 DArTseq SNPs. After the quality control, the genetic diversity and relationship were analyzed with dartR package, STRUCTURE and STRUCTURE Harvester. Only 8087 markers and 86 samples were remained for analysis. The high and low expected heterozygosity (He) were observed in Rwamagana (0.405) and SASSO (0.388) populations, respectively. The lowest difference was observed between SASSO and Rwamagana populations (0.018). The structure analysis separated IC (Cluster 1) from SASSO chickens (Cluster 2). Chickens from Rwamagana population were genetically related to SASSO indicating the uncontrolled crossbreeding. DArTseq SNPs were efficient and can be recommended for genomic studies in chickens.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its <xref rid="sec018" ref-type="sec">Supporting information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its <xref rid="sec018" ref-type="sec">Supporting information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2017, the contribution of the agricultural sector in Rwanda, including livestock, was estimated at approximately 31% of the country&#8217;s gross domestic product (GDP), as reported in the Poultry Sector Analysis of Rwanda (<xref rid="pone.0331316.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). In the same year, according to the Rwanda Livestock Master Plan (LMP), developed in 2017 by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) and the Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resources Development Board (RAB), the livestock subsector accounted for approximately 7 million chickens (<xref rid="pone.0331316.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>). There was an increase in the poultry population, with 5.3 million chickens as reported in the same document (<xref rid="pone.0331316.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>) and by National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (<xref rid="pone.0331316.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref>), 70% of those birds being indigenous chickens (ICs). Mbuza et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] reported that approximately 92.4% of households interviewed keep indigenous chickens, whereas 7.6% keep exotic or improved strains. The flock size at household level was estimated to be between 2 and 20 birds, but the size of less than 10 birds per rural household was predominant [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (<xref rid="pone.0331316.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 File</xref>) reported the total production of 117,430,896 eggs in 2020, while it was estimated that 8,272 tons of total eggs and 38,845 tons of total chicken meat were produced in 2020 as reported in the Poultry Sector Analysis of Rwanda, cited above. Although ICs constitute the majority of poultry produced in Rwanda, their production is too low; however, it accounts for 32% and 34% of the eggs and chicken meat produced, respectively, as reported in LMP. Indigenous chickens are predominantly managed in an extensive system, and the breeding practices under this system are very complicated [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Most of the IC chickens kept by rural households for flock replacement are bought from village markets, neighbors or from their own flocks [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The consequence of this breeding system is a decrease in genetic variability in favor of a high level of inbreeding. The LMP, mentioned above highlighted a strategy to supply good breeding stock to farmers. Two subsystems have been proposed to improve the family chicken production system, namely, improved traditional family chickens (ITFCs) and crossbred family chickens (CFCs). The aim of LMP was to reduce red meat consumption in favor of chicken and pork consumption. The LMP expected that the production of eggs would increase to 1.9 billion in 2032, with 5.7&#8201;kg or 114 eggs per capita. Improving the traditional family system of increasing ICs will contribute greatly to meeting these expectations. The two production systems proposed by the LMP, are expected to be used for IC genetic improvement: selection from the existing IC and crossbreeding between IC and exotic breeds. However, the ICs must be well morphologically and genetically characterized for better valorization of their genetic variability in breeding and conservation programs. Two studies on morphological characterization [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and three studies on genetic diversity and population structure have been published. The first study on genetic diversity used microsatellite markers [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the second used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and the third used Diversity Array Technology (DArT) [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Rwandan IC were classified into four gene pools based on genetic similarity [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This study demonstrated that IC from the Eastern of the country were clustered alone, suggesting the large population size and the low gene inflow. The IC in North West and Central North grouped together, highlighting the high gene flow between two agro-ecological zones, especially through the exchange of reproductives. The similar trend was observed in IC from South West and Central South which clustered together. The fourth gene pool comprised IC from South West in admixture with exotic chickens suggesting the occurrence introduction of exotic breeds in the area aiming at the genetic improvement of IC through crossbreeding. The study conducted in Eastern province of Rwanda by Mujyambere et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] detected sub-populations among IC, reinforcing the existence of unique gene pools even within one region. The high expected heterozygosity (0.658) observed in the study by Habimana et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and the number of alternate allele counts (21 alleles per locus) observed in the study by Mujyambere et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] suggested a high genetic variability within IC populations. The low inbreeding coefficient of 0.04 observed within IC [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and the absence of extreme divergence (0.010&#8211;0.056) among IC populations [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] indicated the absence of inbreeding bottleneck and the broadness of the genetic diversity. Findings from these studies were relevant to LMP objectives by demonstrating the existence of high genetic variability among IC populations confirming that the genetic improvement can occur within IC populations without reducing the diversity although distinct gene pools for breeding programs focusing on localized-particular traits were defined. In addition to genetic variability studied, the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with body weight of IC and their immune response to Newcastle disease were identified [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to assist in breeding selection of reproductives resisting to this viral disease. However, for enhancing the IC conservation, supply of characterized IC to rural household farmers, and promote the crossbreeding between IC and exotic breeds for genetic improvement, four IC breeds were recently morphologically and genetically characterized, namely: Inshenzi, Inganda (Dwarf), Umurangi (Naked neck), and Indayi [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, exotic breeds have been introduced in Rwanda, particularly in Eastern Province. The recent and spread breed was SASSO. These SASSO chickens, along with other exotic breeds, were kept together with indigenous chickens so that they crossed without control [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, the implementation of the two breeding subsystems described above requires the use of pure breeds, which require genetic characterization. Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm the existence of genetic variability in ICs and their relationships with a range of exotic breeds already available across the country. This study used DArTseq SNP markers to study the genetic diversity and population structure of IC in the Eastern Province of Rwanda. DArTseq SNPs, similar to other DArT markers, such as SilicoDArTs, were discovered and sequenced in the whole genome of plants [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and were found to be biallelic and codominant markers scored as present [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] or absent (0) [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. DArTseq SNPs are suitable for genetic diversity and population structure studies because of their numerous advantages, such as high-throughput genotyping, cost-effectiveness, no prior sequence information needed, simplicity and speed, accuracy in population studies, and low DNA input [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. DArT markers have been shown to be effective for genomic studies in chickens [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The aim was to study the genetic diversity and relationships of indigenous chickens in Bugesera and Rwamagana populations with SASSO chickens via DArTseq SNPs in Rwanda. Understanding the relationship between indigenous chickens from two populations and SASSO chickens will provide insight into the effectiveness of breeding methods and aid in decision-making before planning breeding and conservation programs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area</title><p>The study area covered the Bugesera and Rwamagana distrcits of the Eastern Province of Rwanda [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Bugesera is located between 30&#176; 05&#8217; East Longitude, and 2&#176; 09&#8217; South Latitude, whereas Rwamagana lies between 30&#176; 26&#8217; East Longitude and 1&#176; 57&#8217; 9&#8220; South Latitude. The ambient temperature ranged from 26<sup>o</sup>C to 29<sup>o</sup>C and from 19<sup>o</sup>C to 30<sup>o</sup>C for Bugesera and Rwamagana, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Chicken blood sampling procedure</title><p>Eighty-seven (87) chickens were selected for blood sample collection. The selected chickens originated from three populations, the Bugesera and Rwamagana populations, from the Bugesera and Rwamagana districts of the Eastern Province of Rwanda, and the SASSO population. The sample for blood collection was composed of 30 birds from Bugesera, 47 birds from Rwamagana, and 10 birds from SASSO. As mentioned in the study of [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the SASSO population was composed of 10 SASSO chickens. The birds were collected from different rural households, with one bird from each at a distance of more than 500 m, to avoid the sampling of related birds with reference to the sampling protocol proposed by [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. SASSO chickens were selected from two flocks of private farmers, one flock from each district. Three reasons explain the choice of these populations. The first reason was the contribution to poultry value chain development in the Eastern province of Rwanda, one of the objectives of the SEAD (Strengthening Education for Agricultural Development) project before it closed in June 2021. The second reason was based on the location of two districts bordering the City of Kigali as potential markets for poultry products. The third reason was the increase in gene flow due to the spread of SASSO chickens among rural farmers by Uzima chicken Ltd. Indigenous chickens of both sexes (males and females) were sampled at ages ranging from 8 to 10 months, whereas only SASSO females were sampled at 9 months of age. ICs were managed at households in rural villages, and their mating was random but not controlled. SASSO purebred chickens were maintained in an intensive system at private egg production farms where they were fed layer feed. Blood samples of 2&#8201;ml each were collected from the wing vein in a 4 ml-EDTA tube by a licensed and professional veterinarian with 21Gx1 1/2 (MED-833) multi-drawing needles after disinfecting the sampling site with a cotton imbibed alcohol. A vaccine carrier box was used to carry tubes containing blood samples for transport at ambient temperature. Before any treatment, the samples were kept in a refrigerator in the laboratory of Biology of the University of Rwanda, College of Science and Technology (CST), at 4<sup>o</sup>C. Within less than 24 hours, with the use of pipettes and pipette tips, under sterilization conditions, blood samples of 1&#181;l were collected, with one sample from each EDTA tube being dropped into 87 wells of a 96-well PCR plate. After being covered and sealed, the 96- well PCR plate containing the blood samples was transported at ambient temperature and sent to SEQART Africa located at Biosciences Eastern and Central Africa at the International Livestock Research Institute (BecA-ILRI) Hub, formerly the Integrated Genotyping Service and Support (IGSS) platform, in Nairobi Kenya for genotyping. The guidelines of the revised Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 were followed for all chicken handling and for participation of bird owners, and all methods were implemented in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations of the Declaration of Helsinki. Consequently, before the study began, the research protocol was approved by the Research Screening and Ethical Clearance Committee of the College of Agriculture, Animal Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, University of Rwanda, and the issued Research Ethical Clearance reference number was 033/19/DRI.

Nucleomag is the method used to extract DNA from blood samples, where 50&#8722;100&#8201;ng/&#181;l is the range of the amount of extracted genomic DNA. Agarose (0.8% agarose) was used to check the quantity and quality of the extracted DNA. PCR amplification of adapter-ligated fragments following the DArTSeq complexity method through digestion of genomic DNA and ligation of barcoded adapters was used to construct libraries according to the protocol detailed by [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Single-read sequencing runs for 77 bases were used to sequence libraries already constructed, and Hiseq2500 was used in the next-generation sequencing procedure. This sequencing process uses genotyping by sequencing (GBG), a DArTseq technique that provides, even from most complex polyploid genomes, high-quality, rapid and affordable genome profiling, as reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. DArTsoft14, an in-house marker scoring algorithm-based pipeline, was used for DArTseq marker scoring. SNP markers are a type of DArTseq marker binary scored for the presence/absence (1 and 0, respectively) of the restriction fragment in the genomic representation of the sample. This DArTseq marker system was aligned with the reference genome of chicken v5 to identify chromosomes and positions (Gallus_gallus-5.0 - Genome - Assembly - NCBI (nih.gov).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Genetic diversity and population structure</title><p>Missing data are sometimes challenging in statistical data analysis.

It was launched by Diversity Arrays Technology Ltd, in 2017. The imputation was performed with simple matching coefficient (SMC) of 0.743 generated via the null method. The method was run on a dataset with an additional 10% introduced missing values. The imputed, introduced missing values were then compared to the original dataset to calculate a Simple Matching Coefficient (SMC). DArTseq SNP markers were checked for their quality before any analysis performed via the filter option of MS Excel. Markers without identified positions and sex chromosome-linked markers were removed before data analysis.

This was similarly visualized in the dendrogram of the chicken populations, which were divided into two distinct groups (<xref rid="pone.0331316.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>): one group was composed of SASSO (Sa) chickens, and the other group was composed of Bugesera (Bu) and Rwamagana (Rw) chickens.

However, cluster 2 included 40 chicken genotypes from the Rwamagana population and all 29 genotypes from Bugesera. This admixture explains the close relationship observed between the Rwamagana population and SASSO chickens, confirming what was observed with Nei&#8217;s genetic distance and PCA above. The two clusters presented high genetic variability explained by the expected heterozygosity (He). Cluster 2 had greater genetic variability (He&#8201;=&#8201;0.404) than did cluster 1 (He&#8201;=&#8201;0.361).

The call rate in our study was slightly similar to those reported in horses (0.97) and sheep (0.97), and slightly higher than the call rate reported by Gurgul et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] for bovines (0.95). Notably, a call rate&#8201;&gt;&#8201;80%, minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt; 0.01, and HWE with p&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.001 were the criteria for SNP quality control for the species used in the studies above. This study revealed that almost all the DArTseq SNPs used were able to assign all the genotypes. The results from this study elucidated the resemblance in terms of locus quality control. Polymorphism is the parameter used to characterize the quality of genetic markers and confers the ability to be selected for genomic studies. According to Serrote et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], a genetic marker is not effective if it is unable to detect the genetic dissimilarities present among a given number of individuals. The polymorphism of a marker can be qualitatively or quantitatively characterized. Qualitatively, a marker is said to be polymorphic when two alleles are present, and the frequency of the most frequent allele increases to 99%, as mentioned by Shete et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], whereas quantitatively, the heterozygosity in the study of Nei and Roychoudhury [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and the polymorphic information content (PIC) in the study of Botstein et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] are used to measure the marker&#8217;s polymorphism. The number of DArTseq SNP polymorphic loci (95%) was greater than the 82.3% of polymorphic microsatellite loci observed in the study by Habimana et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The difference might be due either to the marker&#8217;s features or to the PIC estimation method. The microsatellites are codominant markers, whereas the SNPs are biallelic markers with presence or absence (1,0) scores. The PIC estimation for codominant markers is based on the allele frequency, with PIC values ranging from 0 (monomorphic markers) to 1 (highly informative) [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], where PIC values less than 0.25 provide less information [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For codominant but biallelic markers such as SNPs [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the PIC values range from 0 (monomorphic markers) to 0.5 (markers available in 50% of individuals and absent in the remaining 50%) and are estimated via heterozygosity in a similar way [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] for dominant markers, 0.5 is the maximum value [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Ranges of PIC values of 0&#8211;0.10, 0.10&#8211;0.25, 0.25&#8211;0.40, and 0.40&#8211;0.50 are described as low, medium, high, and very high, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These relative ranges offer high-quality DArTseq SNPs used in this study, which are highly polymorphic, and have been recommended for genetic studies in indigenous chickens. The polymorphic DArTseq SNP loci produced in this study were distributed across 28 chromosomes from 5 loci (chromosome 16) to 1450 loci (chromosome 1). A total of 42.87% (3,463 loci) of all the loci were located on the first 3 chromosomes. This might explain the different sizes of the 38 pairs of autosomal chromosomes in the chicken genome. The differences in chromosome sizes can be confirmed by the information provided in <xref rid="pone.0331316.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. The first 5 chromosomes are longer than the other chromosomes, and they host more than half of the polymorphic DArTseq SNP loci used in this study. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0331316.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, the sizes of the chromosomes decrease progressively from chromosome 1. Chicken chromosomes are conventionally classified into three groups: a) those from chromosomes 1&#8211;5 are described as macrochromosomes as they are larger than 40 Mbp, b) those from chromosomes 6&#8211;12 are described as intermediate chromosomes, and c) the remaining chromosomes are described as micro-chromosomes [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although some micro-chromosomes host a relatively large number of loci, the polymorphic DArTseq SNP markers located on the first five macrochromosomes, particularly on chromosome 1, could be sufficient for investigating genetic diversity, population structure, and other genomic studies in IC populations. The results of this study revealed that there was no difference in the distribution of DArTseq SNPs in the chicken genome between populations. Similar results showing a high number of SNP markers on chromosome 1 were observed in horses and sheep [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], with 5.4% and 9.2% polymorphic markers, respectively. The results of this study disagree with what was observed in the bovine study mentioned by Gurgul et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and that, with the exception of chromosome X, autosome 4 was the chromosome that hosted the greater number of markers, representing 4.6% of the polymorphic SNPs. In all cases, the results show that SNP coverage is more important on the first chromosomes in chickens than it is in these species, in which the variation in the distribution of markers on chromosomes can be low. In terms of the alternate allele distribution across all the loci, in SASSO, 534 loci presented no alternate alleles. This type of chicken presented a greater number of loci (475 loci), with 1 alternate allele. The results in <xref rid="pone.0331316.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> show the differences observed between populations. In the Bugesera and Rwamagana populations, which presented a low number of loci with 0 or 1 alternate allele, all the loci (100%) were polymorphic, whereas, in the SASSO population, only 98.9% were polymorphic (<xref rid="pone.0331316.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The results for polymorphic loci in other animal species were similar to those for chickens in the current study. It ranges from 0.97 to 0.99 in Australian goat breeds, and from 0.90 to 0.95 in Canadian goat breeds [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The implication of the presence of a high number of loci presenting low alternate alleles is the decrease in marker polymorphism, which might indicate the level of allele fixation at that locus in the population. Local breeds tend to have a greater number of polymorphic loci than exotic breeds do. The results from the current work confirmed those observed in the work of Mollah et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] via random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. The quality of the DArTseq SNP markers in terms of the genotype calling rate, high polymorphism, and high number of alternate alleles across the genome make them suitable for chicken genetic studies, including genetic diversity and population structure.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Genetic variability and genetic relationships between chicken populations</title><p>In designing or updating breeding and conservation programs, genetic diversity characterization within population is crucial [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The genetic variability and relationships between and within populations were analyzed with genetic distance indices (<xref rid="pone.0331316.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>), Nei&#8217;s genetic distance matrix, heterozygosity (<xref rid="pone.0331316.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and dendrograms (<xref rid="pone.0331316.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). The genetic distance index between all 86 individual chickens was 0.344&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.026, indicating that they were genetically distant. Bugesera and Rwamagana chickens are genetically closer and moderately distant from SASSO chickens. The genetic diversity represented by expected heterozygosity (He) was slightly lower in SASSO and quite similar in Bugesera and Rwamagana ICs. In all the cases, in the present study, the expected heterozygosity was greater than the observed heterozygosity. This explains the potential fixation of some alleles in the populations, which could result in an increase in inbreeding. This situation could be because the mating systems in the study area might not be random, as most households use birds from their own flocks or from close neighbors. In addition, mating occurs between parents and progeny or between siblings, half-sibs, cousins, etc., which could result in deviation from Hard-Weinberg equilibrium in these populations. The loci were highly polymorphic in the populations, which explains their segregation. Contrasting results were observed in Chinese local chickens, in which He was either lower than or equal to Ho [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, the discrepancy in genetic distances observed within populations was due to co-ancestry mating, and the level of inbreeding. However, the absence of intensive selection within the native chicken populations, unlike the SASSO population, makes them an outbred population, which is the main reason for the variations between the two types of chickens. This can be confirmed by the high genetic distance observed, which points to the presence of high heterogeneity in native chickens. The low genetic dissimilarity and low genetic variability observed in SASSO chickens could be due to intensive selection of productive traits and inbreeding resulting in the fixation of alleles. This observation corroborates the findings of [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], that genetic variability in commercial breeds was reduced to 50%. Similarly, low genetic diversity in local chickens was observed in Chinese layer lines [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This confirmed what was observed in goat populations in Australia [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], where the genetic diversity and genetic distance in Rangeland goats were greater than those in the Toggenburg breed, which experienced artificial selection. However, the genetic distances observed in this study were slightly similar to those reported in Rangeland goats in Australia (0.323) and slightly greatly than those reported in other Australian and Canadian goats, ranging from 0.263 to 0.307 [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This study revealed that IC populations are more closely related, and distant from SASSO chickens (improved breeds), as confirmed by the dendrogram (<xref rid="pone.0331316.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). The absence of genetic distance between IC populations could be explained by the fact that these populations are very close neighbors, as they have a common border; thus, the share of genetic materials implies that the two populations have a common ancestor. These findings corroborate the conclusion of Wright [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], who stated that the geographical closeness between populations influences the genetic relatedness between them. Another possibility is the large chicken population in this region [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which helps to conserve their alleles and prevent mutations. Our study confirmed several earlier findings on the small genetic distances and close genetic relationships among native chicken populations in Rwanda [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], Iran [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and India [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Analysis of the population structure of chicken samples</title><p>The analysis of chicken population structure was performed via PCA (<xref rid="pone.0331316.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>), the STRUCTURE program (<xref rid="pone.0331316.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), and AMOVA (<xref rid="pone.0331316.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). All the chicken genotypes were correctly clustered on the basis of the origin of the IC population, and were separated from the exotic breed used (SASSO). This means that all the ICs have the same genetic background and similar management, which are different from those of the SASSO breed. The Bugesera and Rwamagana populations were grouped into one group, and the SASSO chickens were grouped into another group. The individuals clustered together indicate that they share the same genetic background or have a common ancestor. As mentioned earlier, the Bugesera and Rwamagana populations are closer to each other. However, although they are assigned to the same group, they are different geographically, indicating that there is genetic differentiation between them. A similar classification of IC based on geographical location was observed in Rwanda [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and in Italian local chickens [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The same classification was also reported in other species in Italy by Ciani et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] in sheep breeds, in goat breeds [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and in cattle by Mastrangelo et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and Gurgul et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, in our study, the chicken genotypes were grouped on the basis of geographical classification for indigenous chicken individuals and genetic classification for all chicken individuals. A study by Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] reported similar results, with the classification distinguishing exotic chicken breeds from Chinese IC breeds exhibiting consistency in their genetic structure, as observed in this study. Twelve chickens and 7 chickens identified via PCA and STRUCTURE, respectively, were admixed with SASSO chickens, and were all from the Rwamagana population. This provides information on where attention should be placed when planning breeding and conservation strategies for Bugesera and Rwamagana populations. Before any planning, the initial analysis of population structure, including all genetic resources present, could be necessary, particularly in the Rwamagana population and in all Rwandan chicken populations in general. This will help to identify individuals with pure genetic profiles that will serve as a starting point for breeding and gene conservation programs. The DArTseq SNP markers used in this study presented a high number of variants in IC, and are suitable for further genomic studies in Rwandan IC. Assuming that these markers are linked to economically important QTLs, these markers are certainly able to identify them, allowing the setting of breeding objectives that can serve as targets of a successful genomic selection approach in IC. This assumption can be explained by the studies of Gonz&#225;lez et l. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and Hu [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], who confirmed the association between allele counts and phenotypes for a specific trait of economic importance. The population structure and classification were supported by the AMOVA results, which revealed that the distinction between populations was significant (P&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01), indicating a difference between IC and SASSO chickens. A high proportion of variance was observed between genotypes, represented by 80.3%. The value observed in this study was&#8201;&gt;&#8201;15%, reported as an indicator of significant dissimilarity between samples within populations [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A comparable situation was observed in a previous study by Habimana et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], who reported a variance of 92%. Similar observations were reported in other studies on IC population structure, such as [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] in Italy, [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] in Ethiopia and Cameroon, and [<xref rid="pone.0331316.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] in Tanzania.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The chicken genotypes studied via the use of DArTseq SNP markers varied genetically and geographically. The IC populations presented high genetic variability but were genetically distant from the SASSO chickens. The SASSO chicken population was revealed to be genetically related to indigenous chickens from Rwamagana, resulting from gene flow through uncontrolled cross-breeding between SASSO chickens and IC. In addition, as SASSO chickens exhibit improved adaptability to harsh environments like IC, studies on their crossbreeding with IC could be encouraged to investigate the performance of their progeny under free-ranging management conditions. Thus, due to their genome coverage and high polymorphism, DArTseq SNP markers are suitable for genomic studies in chickens, and the genetic variability observed in Rwandan IC could be useful in planning genetic improvement and conservation programs. Therefore, functional validation of the identified DArTse SNP markers remains a priority for future research.</p></sec><sec id="sec018" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0331316.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>Inclusivity in global research.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0331316.s001.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0331316.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>DArTseq SNPs generated used in this study.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0331316.s002.csv" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0331316.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Metadata.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0331316.s003.xlsx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0331316.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Genetic distances within and between chicken populations.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0331316.s004.xlsx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0331316.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Poultry Sector Analysis of Rwanda.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0331316.s005.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0331316.s006" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Rwanda Livestock Master Plan.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0331316.s006.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0331316.s007" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Integrated Household conditions Survey.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0331316.s007.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0331316.s008" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Agricultural Household survey 2020.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0331316.s008.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge and address special thanks to the SEAD (Strengthening Education for Agricultural Development) project for their support.

Specifically, how do the current statistics compare to previous levels of inbreeding? Have these studies demonstrated a measurable improvement in genetic variability among the birds? Including this information would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the program&#8217;s effectiveness.</p><p>Answer: Some findings from studies were included in the introduction to link them with the LMP.</p><p>P 4 &#8211; P5: L 88 &#8211; L 113</p><p>Comment 2: A question for clarity: Why were the indigenous chickens (IC) sampled at ages 8 to 10 months, while only female SASSO chickens were sampled precisely at 9 months of age?</p><p>P 7: L 163 &#8211; L 168</p><p>Answer: Thank you for the question. The difference in age of sampling between IC and SASSO females was based on two main factors:</p><p>- Birds&#8217; maturity: the aim was to use chickens already in reproduction age. Since IC are late and heterogeneous in entering mature age, most of them reach the body size and start laying between 7 to 10 months of age. However, SASSO are improved dual-purpose breeds (meat and eggs) and are fast growers, they can reach maturity around 5 &#8211; 6 months.</p><p>- Environmental factors: variation in maturity depends on the interaction between genetics and environment. These IC were sampled from different households with different management practices, which may cause the variability in attaining the maturity. Then, only SASSO females were considered in this study because they were sampled from one intensive egg production farm. They were at the age of 9 months. Since no SASSO males were available, the screening took into account the loci on the sex chromosomes to avoid bias in findings.</p><p>Comment 3: Towards the end of the discussion on genetic variability and genetic relationships between chicken populations, you briefly mention how the absence of intensive selection within native chicken populations leads to inbreeding, contributing to genetic variation between the two types of chickens. However, I found this part somewhat unclear, especially in relation to your earlier point about mating systems in the study area potentially not being random. It might be helpful to elaborate further on this connection as I was unsure about the exact argument being made and the direction you were leading us toward in this discussion.</p><p>Answer: You are right! The confusion is no longer there.</p><p>The &#8220;inbred&#8221; was replaced by the &#8220;outbred&#8221;.</p><p>P 21: L 518</p><p>Comment 4: I suggest mentioning the authors' names when referencing them in-text before including the numbered citation. Using only a number, such as (1), disrupts the readability of the sentence. For example, instead of writing:</p><p>"There was an increase in poultry production, reported in 2014 by (2),"</p><p>it would read more smoothly as:</p><p>"There was an increase in poultry production, reported in 2014 by Sharpio (2)."</p><p>Answer: The comment considered and citations corrected:</p><p>P 3: L 57</p><p>P 18: L 429</p><p>P 18: L 435</p><p>P 18: L 439</p><p>P 18: L 440</p><p>P 18: L 441</p><p>P 18: L 444</p><p>P 20: L 475</p><p>P 20: L 491</p><p>P 22: L 535</p><p>P 23: L 556</p><p>P 23: L 557</p><p>P 23: L 559</p><p>P 24: L 573</p><p>P 24: L 580</p><p>Comment 5: There was an inconsistency in the in-text citations, as some were numbered while others were not. I noticed this particularly in the Methods section.</p><p>Answer: Thank you! Corrected</p><p>P 6: L 143</p><p>P 11: L 254</p><p>Comment 6: Throughout the manuscript, the number of chicken genotypes (87 or 86) was inconsistently written as "eight-seven" instead of "eighty-seven" or "eighty-six." I recommend correcting this for clarity and consistency.</p><p>Answer: Thank you! Corrected:</p><p>P 2: L 28: &#8220;Eight-seven&#8221; was replaced by &#8220;Eighty-seven&#8221;.</p><p>P 7: L 149: &#8220;Eight-seven&#8221; was replaced by &#8220;Eighty-seven&#8221;.</p><p>Comment 7: In the Abstract, the authors introduced low He, assuming readers would immediately recognize the term. To avoid confusion or unnecessary assumptions, I suggest replacing it with "expected heterozygosity (He)" for clarity right from the start of the paper.</p><p>Answer: Thank you! Corrected</p><p>P 2: L 32</p><p>Comment 8: Do not start a sentence with an abbreviation; instead, write it out in full when beginning a sentence. Thank you! Considered</p><p>P 3: L 66</p><p>P 10: L 240 &#8211; L 241</p><p>Comment 9: Please ensure that page numbers are included in the manuscript.</p><p>Answer: Thank you! Page numbers and line numbers were included in the manuscript</p><p>Reviewer # 2</p><p>Comment 1: One major thing which is not revealed anywhere, the distribution of loci at any particular chromosome is still ambiguous, author must explain as written in Figure 2. Distribution of loci on 28 chromosomes and its legend.</p><p>Answer: Thank you for this concern!</p><p>However, the interpretation of the distribution of loci on chromosomes as written in Figure 2, was extended:</p><p>- Legend added (chr: chromosome) P 12: L 283</p><p>- In results P 12: L 280 &#8211; L 293</p><p>- In discussions: P 19 &#8211; P 20: L 455 &#8211; L 479</p><p>Comment 2: The other concern is that in result section there is reported 45677 alleles in the present work, however, very few were grouped and represented into figure 4, need to explain about remaining alleles</p><p>Answer: Thank you for this concern! You are right.</p><p>However, the quality control of markers was performed so that only informative and good markers remain for data analysis. This for the following reasons:</p><p>- To ensure data accuracy and reliability: low quality markers (with lots of missing data for example) can introduce noise which can lead to false association, biased diversity estimates, and unreliable population structure results</p><p>- To remove non-informative or problematic markers: all markers which are monomorphic (no variation), having a very low Minor allele Frequency, etc.</p><p>- To improve statistical power and validity: this avoids misleading genetic diversity or population structure analysis and improves the reproducibility and scientific credibility of results.</p><p>The criteria used in this study for quality control were described in the section of materials and methods:</p><p>P 10: L 224 &#8211; L 241</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0331316.s010" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Rebuttal letter.pdf</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0331316.s010.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0331316.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0331316.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Chaubey</surname><given-names initials="G">Gyaneshwer</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Gyaneshwer Chaubey</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Gyaneshwer Chaubey</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj003" xml:lang="en" journal-id="PLoS One" journal-id-type="nlm-ta" ext-link-type="pubmed" xlink:href="40938903"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
