During the experiment, the mice were divided into three groups by employing a random number table method: NaIO&#8323;-na&#239;ve, NaIO<sub>3</sub>-10 mg, and NaIO<sub>3</sub>-30 mg. To induce the AMD model, the mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 2 mL NaIO<sub>3</sub> at doses of 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg. Following this, each group of mice underwent intravitreal injections. The right eye of each mouse received a single intravitreal injection of PBS-soluble clopamide (35&#160;&#181;g, 1&#160;&#181;L), a commonly used thiazide diuretic, and the left eye received an equal volume of PBS as a control. Four days later, all mice were subjected to follow-up experiments. Some of the mice were placed in a dark room to rule out the phototoxicity of thiazide drugs. To achieve specific knockdown of <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> in the RPE layer of mice, we utilized the pAAV-RPE-mCherry-5&#8242;mir30a-shRNA-3&#8242;mir30a vector purchased from Tsingke Biotech (Beijing, China). Based on previously established protocols, we adjusted the light intensity of the operating environment to an appropriate brightness. Under the guidance of a dissecting microscope, 1 &#181;L of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)/<italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> (10<sup>12</sup> genome copies/mL) was injected into the subretinal space of the right eye using a flat-tipped microsyringe. For the control, the AAV9 empty vector viral supernatant was injected into the subretinal space of the left eye. After 28 days, NaIO&#8323; was administered intraperitoneally, and a follow-up experiment was conducted 4 days later.

Model 1, a crude model without adjustment for covariates and corresponding to the univariate analysis results, preliminarily suggested a lower risk of AMD among participants taking other antihypertensive drugs compared with those taking thiazide diuretics only. Model 2, a multiple regression model adjusted for age, sex, race, PIR, education level, BMI, smoking and alcohol status, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, further confirmed that the risk of AMD was significantly reduced in participants who were taking thiazide diuretics combined with other antihypertensive drugs (OR = 0.850; 95% CI, 0.730&#8211;0.989; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 3.60E-02) or not taking any antihypertensive drugs (OR = 0.820; 95% CI, 0.715&#8211;0.983; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 4.00E-03) compared with those who were taking thiazide diuretics only (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

Fundus photography and OCT showed no retinal damage in NaIO&#8323;-na&#239;ve mice. In contrast, in the NaIO<sub>3</sub>-10 mg group, thiazide diuretics induced localized RPE layer damage.

ERG results indicated no significant difference in light and dark adaptation between eyes treated with thiazide diuretics and those with placebo in the NaIO&#8323;-na&#239;ve group. However, in the NaIO&#8323;-10 mg group, the b-wave amplitude was significantly lower in eyes treated with thiazide diuretics compared to control eyes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;4</xref>C).

Histological analysis confirmed these findings: H&amp;E staining showed normal retinal anatomy in the NaIO<sub>3</sub>-na&#239;ve group. In the NaIO<sub>3</sub>-10 mg group, thiazide diuretics caused significant hypertrophy, atrophy, and depigmentation in the local RPE layer compared to controls. The NaIO<sub>3</sub>-30 mg group exhibited severe retinal damage, with greater disorder in thiazide-treated eyes, especially in the outer nuclear and inner nuclear layers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;4</xref>D).

Immunofluorescence staining of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) further demonstrated that thiazide diuretics exacerbate the structural damage of RPE cells under oxidative stress conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;4</xref>F). In addition, the results of the darkroom group enabled us to cautiously rule out the influence of the phototoxicity of thiazides on the pathological changes observed in our study.

Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> knockdown further intensified the green fluorescence, suggesting that <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> knockdown exacerbates the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential under oxidative stress conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;5</xref>F).

In addition, to more directly verify the effect of thiazide diuretics on RPE cells, we treated the cells with or without 10-mM/mL clopamide for 24 hours and then observed whether the inhibition of sodium&#8211;chloride co-transporter (NCC) would exacerbate the RPE damage caused by oxidative stress. The results showed that, compared with the RPE cells in the &#8220;Control (Con)+NaIO<sub>3</sub>&#8221; group, the RPE cells in the &#8220;Clopamide (CLO)+NaIO<sub>3</sub>&#8221; group exhibited a more significant increase in the mortality rate (<xref rid="iovs-66-12-24_s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>), levels of ROS (<xref rid="iovs-66-12-24_s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>), and mitochondrial damage (<xref rid="iovs-66-12-24_s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>).

Notably, a comparison of the control versus Con+NaIO<sub>3</sub>, knockdown versus KD+NaIO<sub>3</sub>, and Con+NaIO<sub>3</sub> versus KD+NaIO<sub>3</sub> groups showed that the NaIO<sub>3</sub>-induced oxidative stress models were closely linked to ferroptosis, regardless of whether <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> was knocked down or not. Furthermore, 30 genes were commonly differentially expressed across these comparisons (<xref rid="iovs-66-12-24_s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>A). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) further suggested that <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> knockdown may promote ferroptosis of ARPE-19 cells under oxidative stress conditions (<xref rid="iovs-66-12-24_s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>B). Using TEM, we observed unique morphological features of mitochondria in <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> knockdown ARPE-19 cells treated with NaIO<sub>3</sub> for 24 hours, indicative of more pronounced ferroptosis, such as reduced mitochondrial volume, increased membrane density, and disruption of cristae, compared with the non-knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;6</xref>D). By using ICP-MS to detect the dynamic changes in Na<sup>+</sup> uptake of ARPE-19 cells in different groups with or without NaIO<sub>3</sub> intervention, the results showed that Na<sup>+</sup> uptake in the Con+NaIO<sub>3</sub> group increased rapidly under oxidative stress.

Ferrostatin staining revealed that <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> knockdown increased iron accumulation in ARPE-19 cells under oxidative stress conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;6</xref>J), but MDA analysis suggested increased levels of lipid peroxidation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;6</xref>G).

To augment the robustness of our genetic findings, we also conducted a cross-sectional analysis based on the UK Biobank and NHANES databases. Although the results of univariate analysis based on the NHANES suggested that the use of thiazide diuretics may be a protective factor for AMD, the results lacked precision due to the omission of covariates.

The final results were consistent with those of the non-darkroom group. Combined with the results shown by the negative control group under normal light conditions, that intravitreal injection of thiazides alone did not cause RPE damage, these data strongly indicate that, under the specific concentration and experimental conditions of our study, the observed effects on the retina cannot be attributed to the phototoxicity of thiazides. Of note, the exclusion of phototoxicity under our specific conditions does not negate the possibility of relevant phototoxicity of thiazides in clinical scenarios or other experimental models.

Enrichment and GSEA analyses further suggested that <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> knockdown may promote ferroptosis of ARPE-19 cells in this context, a finding that was substantiated by TEM microstructure analysis. HO-1 is an enzyme responsible for oxidizing cellular heme to generate free ferrous iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin. The potent antioxidant activity of these metabolites helps to defend against ROS and provides cellular protection.<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61</sup></xref> However, the accumulation of free ferrous iron can induce ferroptosis by contributing to intracellular iron overload.<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr"><sup>62</sup></xref> Notably, previous studies have suggested that HO-1 overexpression may mediate RPE ferroptosis and promote AMD progression.<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr"><sup>63</sup></xref> Based on these findings, we hypothesized that <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> downregulation could promote ferroptosis of RPE cells by upregulating HO-1 expression. To test this hypothesis, we examined ferroptosis-related markers in each group of cells. <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> knockdown significantly increased ferrous ion and MDA levels while decreasing GSH levels in RPE cells under oxidative stress. Additionally, HO-1 is known to be regulated by Nrf2,<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr"><sup>63</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr"><sup>64</sup></xref> and we also included Nrf2 and GPX4 (which is closely associated with GSH) in our western blot assays.<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr"><sup>65</sup></xref> Western blot results confirmed that <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> knockdown significantly increased Nrf2/HO-1 expression and decreased GPX4 expression under oxidative stress. Notably, <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> knockdown exacerbated cell death under oxidative stress, independent of apoptosis. In vivo experiments in the mouse RPE layer further confirmed these findings through immunofluorescence co-localization. We observed that <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> knockdown significantly increased Nrf2/HO-1 expression in the RPE layer in a mouse model of oxidative stress, with the harmful effects being amplified by increasing NaIO<sub>3</sub> dose, leading to more severe damage to cones and rods. However, our results did not find an association between <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SLC7A11</italic> in regulating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, although <italic toggle="yes">SLC7A11</italic> has been reported to slow the progression of neovascular AMD by inhibiting ferroptosis in RPE cells.<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr"><sup>66</sup></xref> Because <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> plays a role in regulating the sodium balance inside and outside the cells, we also measured sodium uptake and the changes in sodium ion concentration in each group of cells. Interestingly, we found that NaIO&#8323; increased sodium uptake in normal RPE cells and significantly elevated intracellular sodium ion concentration. Based on this finding, knockout of <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> significantly reduced sodium ion uptake and intracellular sodium ion concentrations in RPE cells. However, in the absence of oxidative stress, the knockdown of <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> had no impact on the intracellular sodium level. Sodium is a crucial component for maintaining plasma membrane potential and mitochondrial inner membrane potential, both essential for cellular energy balance.<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67</sup></xref> Cytosolic sodium dynamics are tightly coupled with mitochondrial Na<sup>+</sup>, and alterations in sodium ion concentrations can directly affect mitochondrial activity and energy production.<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr"><sup>68</sup></xref> Although the relationship between intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> and oxidative stress remains largely unexplored, we hypothesize that the sodium concentration increase in RPE cells under oxidative stress could represent a defensive cellular response. The reduction in sodium uptake due to <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> knockdown may further impair mitochondrial function, warranting additional experimental investigation.</p><p>This study proposed that thiazide diuretics may potentially affect the occurrence and development of AMD. Genetic analysis based on GWAS data and cross-sectional clinical studies based on the UK Biobank and NHANES can circumvent ethical issues that may be raised by human drug trials. As a key component of the genetic analysis methodology, MR analysis allows for minimization of confounding biases, simulating the reliability of randomized controlled trials. In addition, the IVs used in our genetic analysis were extracted from the latest GWAS database available at present. The sample included in the cross-sectional study covered all participants with AMD information in the UK Biobank and NHANES database, and the fact that the participants represent multi-ethnic populations compensates for the genetic analysis using samples from only European populations. The in vitro and in vivo mechanism studies further validate the accuracy and scientific rigor of the genetic analysis and clinical research findings. It is worth noting that the SMR analysis results did not find a potential association between other antihypertensive drug targets and AMD; therefore, we do not deny the potentially positive effect of antihypertensive treatment on improving AMD. Our findings only suggest that patients with AMD should exercise caution when selecting thiazide diuretics among antihypertensive options. Despite these insights, our study faces several limitations. The GWAS data from blood tissues, although representative, may not capture the nuances of AMD pathogenesis as precisely as data from fundus tissues, such as the RPE layer and choroid, which are currently lacking in GWAS databases. In the SMR analysis, the association between <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> and dry AMD was statistically significant, but the results of the colocalization analysis were moderate, which does not entirely eliminate the possibility of false-positive findings regarding the risk of dry AMD from thiazide diuretics. The uneven distribution between cases and controls within the GWAS dataset, particularly regarding the proportion of AMD subtypes (dry AMD and wet AMD), presents difficulties in achieving sufficient statistical power to accurately interpret the results. This shortcoming is an inherent issue in the current datasets. There may be additional covariates affecting the outcomes of multivariate regression models that were not considered in this study. Also, because the data from participants included in the cross-sectional study could not distinguish between diverse AMD subtypes, subgroup outcomes in the genetic analysis could not be further validated via cross-sectional study. Finally, although the NaIO<sub>3</sub>-induced oxidative stress model is able to mimic some of the key pathological features of AMD, it may not be able to fully replicate all the complexities of human AMD, such as inflammation, genetic background, and other factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study is a groundbreaking exploration of the association between antihypertensive medications and AMD that used multiple genetic analysis methods in conjunction with observational clinical studies based on the UK Biobank and NHANES. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that thiazide diuretics worsened retinal damage in AMD mouse models, and <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> knockdown disrupted the balance of oxidative stress in RPE cells. Further molecular mechanism experiments showed that <italic toggle="yes">SLC12A3</italic> knockdown promoted retinal degeneration by regulating RPE ferroptosis through activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;8</xref>). Our results underscore a notable causal association between thiazide diuretic use and AMD risk. However, larger scale genetic engineering trials, expansive multicenter clinical trials, and in-depth mechanistic extension trials are imperative to enhance the accuracy and validity of our findings.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of the molecular mechanisms by which thiazides exacerbate the risk and progression of AMD.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="iovs-66-12-24-f008.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="iovs-66-12-24_s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplement 1</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="iovs-66-12-24_s001.pdf" id="d67e3266" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the eQTLGen Consortium, FinnGen project, UK Biobank, NHANES, and IEU OpenGWAS project for publicly providing all the data for this study.
