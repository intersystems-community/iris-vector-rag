Myeloid cells within the CNS, including microglia and border-associated macrophages, play a central role in the neuroinflammatory processes associated with MS. Activation of these cells contributes to the local inflammatory response and promotes the recruitment of additional immune cells into the CNS. SLAMF5 is a cell surface receptor that functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, capable of modulating immune cell activity through both activating and inhibitory signals. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of SLAMF5 in CNS-resident and peripheral myeloid cells using the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our findings demonstrate that both total and brain-specific SLAMF5 deficiency in myeloid cells leads to decreased expression of activation and costimulatory molecules, including MHC class II (MHCII) and CD80. This downregulation is mediated, at least in part, through the transcription factor BHLHE40 and its regulation of CD52, resulting in delayed onset and reduced progression of the disease. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of SLAMF5 in the brain halted disease progression and reduced the expression of myeloid activation markers. In human studies, SLAMF5 blockade in peripheral monocytes from MS patients and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia reduced the expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD52. Together, these results identify SLAMF5 as a key regulator of myeloid cell activation in neuroinflammation and suggest that it may represent a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders such as MS.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Myeloid cells drive neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis by promoting immune activation in the central nervous system.

It is characterized by chronic demyelination, oligodendrocyte loss, and progressive axonal and neuronal degeneration [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The clinical presentation and progression of MS are highly heterogeneous, reflecting variability in underlying pathological mechanisms [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. MS triggers inflammation in both white and gray matter, driven by the infiltration of immune cells, primarily CD8&#8314;&#8201;T cells, CD4&#8314;&#8201;T cells, and activated macrophages, which initiate a damaging inflammatory cascade within the CNS [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This response is further amplified by the accumulation of inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and free metal ions released by infiltrating immune cells [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These factors collectively contribute to neuronal injury and activate resident brain immune cells, such as microglia and astrocytes [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A breakdown in immune tolerance, often due to imbalances in the number and/or function of specific T cell subsets, is believed to initiate these pathological events [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The myeloid cell population in the brain is heterogeneous, consisting primarily of microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the CNS [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Microglia, which make up approximately 5%&#8211;20% of CNS cells, are characterized by the expression of macrophage-associated markers such as CD11b [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They originate from yolk sac macrophages that migrate into the CNS during early embryonic development [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

SLAMF5-deficient myeloid cells exhibited significantly reduced expression of both MHCII (<xref rid="pbio.3003373.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.3003373.g001" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>) and CD80 (<xref rid="pbio.3003373.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.3003373.g001" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>) compared to WT controls.

While TMEM119 is a well-established marker for microglia, its expression can be reduced or absent in some microglial cells, particularly under neuroinflammatory conditions [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Based on TMEM119 expression, we identified two distinct myeloid populations: TMEM119-positive microglia and TMEM119-negative myeloid cells. The latter group includes TMEM119-negative microglia, BAMs, and infiltrating peripheral macrophages. The gating strategy used to define these populations is shown in <xref rid="pbio.3003373.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A Fig</xref>. SLAMF5-deficient TMEM119-positive microglia expressed lower levels of MHCII (<xref rid="pbio.3003373.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Fig</xref>) and CD80 (<xref rid="pbio.3003373.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C Fig</xref>) as the total myeloid cells. Thus, both TMEM119-positive and TMEM119-negative cells were in a less activated state in EAE-induced SLAMF5-deficient mice compared to WT controls, suggesting that the lack of SLAMF5 contributes to the regulation of the immune response and the control of excessive inflammation, ultimately leading to milder disease progression. Since no significant differences were observed between the TMEM119-positive and TMEM119-negative populations, we focused the remainder of the study on the total CD11b-positive myeloid population.</p><p>Analysis of the leukocyte population (CD11b<sup>&#8722;</sup> cells) revealed an increased presence of these cells in the brains of sick WT mice. In contrast, SLAMF5-deficient mice exhibited a reduced percentage of CD11b<sup>&#8722;</sup> cells, suggesting that SLAMF5 may play a role in regulating the infiltration and or accumulation of peripheral immune cells, such as T cells, into the brain in the EAE model (<xref rid="pbio.3003373.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>).</p><p>Our previous study demonstrated a reduced Th1 population in the spinal cord of EAE-induced SLAMF5-deficient mice [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, we next examined the T cell population in the brains of EAE-induced mice. SLAMF5-deficient mice exhibited a reduced number of both CD4&#8314; and CD8&#8314;&#8201;T cells, suggesting decreased infiltration, retention, or survival of lymphocytes in the absence of SLAMF5 (<xref rid="pbio.3003373.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.3003373.g001" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>). Furthermore, while levels of IL-17 and FOXP3 in CD4&#8314;&#8201;T cells were comparable between WT and SLAMF5-deficient mice, a significant reduction in interferon-&#947; (IFN-&#947;) expression was observed in CD4&#8314;&#8201;T cells from SLAMF5-deficient mice (<xref rid="pbio.3003373.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1J</xref>). This finding suggests a less activated T cell phenotype in the absence of SLAMF5.

To address this point, we investigated whether SLAMF5 blockade directly regulates microglial activation in vitro. The N9 microglial cell line was stimulated with LPS, as previously described [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], to induce M1-like polarization, thereby mimicking key pro-inflammatory features observed in neuroinflammatory conditions such as EAE. Following LPS stimulation, N9 microglial cells exhibited a significant upregulation of MHCII (~1.75-fold) and CD80 (~8.5-fold), consistent with the activation phenotype of microglia and antigen-presenting cells observed in vivo during EAE induction. When SLAMF5 was blocked during the final 24&#8201;h of LPS stimulation, MHCII expression was reduced to levels comparable to those seen in unstimulated cells. Similarly, CD80 expression was significantly decreased in the presence of the SLAMF5-blocking antibody (<xref rid="pbio.3003373.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pbio.3003373.g003" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>).

The consistent downregulation of activation markers following SLAMF5 blockade, particularly in MS patient-derived cells, supports the potential of SLAMF5 as a therapeutic target for modulating pathogenic myeloid cell responses in neuroinflammatory diseases such as MS.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Discussion</title><p>Myeloid cells&#8212;including monocytes, macrophages, and microglia&#8212;play a central role in the immune response to CNS damage in MS. These cells are recruited to sites of injury, where they release pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species that exacerbate neuroinflammation and tissue damage. In addition to their pro-inflammatory role, myeloid cells contribute to the clearance of cellular debris and support tissue repair. However, in MS, their function can become dysregulated, promoting chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As such, myeloid cells are implicated in both protective and pathogenic processes in MS.</p><p>SLAMF5 is a cell surface receptor expressed on immune cells and involved in regulating immune responses. Our previous work demonstrated that SLAMF5 deficiency or antibody-mediated blockade delays disease onset and improves clinical outcomes in EAE, an animal model of MS, by modulating regulatory B cell function via the transcription factor c-MAF [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the present study, we explored the role of SLAMF5 in myeloid cells within both the CNS and peripheral compartments. Our findings show that disruption of SLAMF5 homophilic interactions&#8212;either by genetic deficiency or antibody blockade&#8212;reduces myeloid cell activation in a CD52-dependent manner.</p><p>CD52 is a GPI-anchored glycoprotein expressed on various immune cell types, including B cells, T cells, and monocytes. Although CD52 has been implicated in MS pathogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], its role in myeloid cells remains poorly defined [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The therapeutic anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab has demonstrated clinical efficacy in MS by depleting CD52-expressing lymphocytes and dampening immune responses [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Our data suggest that SLAMF5 regulates CD52 expression in myeloid cells during inflammation. In EAE-induced mice, CD52&#8212;along with MHCII and CD80&#8212;is upregulated in activated myeloid cells, and this expression is significantly reduced in the absence of SLAMF5 signaling. Unlike broad immunosuppressive strategies such as alemtuzumab, which deplete both T and B cells and carry risks of infection and secondary autoimmunity SLAMF5 blockade selectively modulates CNS myeloid cell activity and may preserve peripheral immune function, offering a more targeted therapeutic approach.</p><p>Mechanistically, we show that SLAMF5 regulates the expression of the transcription factor BHLHE40, which plays a pivotal role in neuroinflammation and EAE progression by controlling cytokine production, including GM-CSF and IL-10 in T cells [<xref rid="pbio.3003373.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In CNS myeloid cells, SLAMF5 promotes BHLHE40 expression and its binding to the CD52 promoter, resulting in elevated CD52 expression. SLAMF5 blockade inhibits this interaction, reducing CD52 levels and leading to decreased myeloid cell activation (<xref rid="pbio.3003373.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Our data further suggest that SLAMF5 influences the ability of CNS myeloid cells to support T cell activation. In both full and conditional SLAMF5 knockout models, we observed a significant reduction in the accumulation of CNS lymphocytes and decreased IFN-&#947; production by CD4&#8314;&#8201;T cells, indicating that SLAMF5-dependent myeloid activation enhances T cell responses during neuroinflammation.</p><p>While the full SLAMF5 knockout model provides valuable insights into the receptor&#8217;s role in immune regulation, certain limitations must be acknowledged. Global deletion of SLAMF5 throughout development and across all immune cell types may induce compensatory mechanisms or systemic alterations beyond the myeloid compartment, potentially confounding the interpretation of cell type&#8211;specific phenotypes. To address this limitation, we repeated key experiments using a cKO model targeting CX3CR1&#8314;&#8201;cells. This myeloid-specific deletion yielded phenotypic and mechanistic outcomes consistent with those observed in the full knockout model, reinforcing the conclusion that SLAMF5 plays a critical and intrinsic role within the myeloid lineage.</p><p>Importantly, we extended our findings to human systems. SLAMF5 blockade reduced the expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD52 in monocytes derived from the peripheral blood of MS patients, as well as in LPS-activated human iPSC-derived microglia. These results confirm a conserved role for SLAMF5 in regulating human myeloid cell activation and support its potential as a therapeutic target in MS.</p><p>In conclusion, our study identifies SLAMF5 as a central regulator of myeloid cell activation via a BHLHE40&#8211;CD52 signaling axis. Targeting SLAMF5 offers a novel and selective approach to modulating neuroinflammation in MS, potentially limiting CNS damage while minimizing systemic immunosuppression.</p></sec><sec id="sec028" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pbio.3003373.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Mice lacking SLAMF5 exhibited delayed disease onset and milder motor dysfunction.</title><p>EAE (MOG35-55) was induced in WT and in SLAMF5-deficient mice. <bold>(A)</bold> Daily Mean clinical scoring of the disease. <bold>(B)</bold> Bar graph shows the Area Under the Curve of the clinical score.

</p><p>Dear Idit,</p><p>Thank you for your patience while we considered your revised manuscript "SLAMF5 Regulates Myeloid-Cell Mediated Neuroinflammation in Multiple Sclerosis" for consideration as a Research Article at PLOS Biology. Your revised study has now been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors, the Academic Editor and two of the original reviewers.</p><p>As you will see in the reports, the reviewers recognize the good job done addressing their previous concerns, but Reviewers #1 still would like some aspects to be addressed. Specifically, Reviewer #1 is concerned that key mechanistic differences between the global KO and conditional KO models were not addressed, and that claims about SLAMF5&#8217;s role in myeloid cell&#8211;mediated neuroinflammation remain descriptive without functional validation, and thinks cell-type specific analyses are required to support the conclusions. The rationale for using global KO instead of cKO for transcriptomics should be clearly justified and discussed as a limitation. The reviewer also requests clarification on whether histopathology was quantified and that statistical comparisons between na&#239;ve and EAE controls be included.</p><p>In light of the reviews, which you will find at the end of this email, we are pleased to offer you the opportunity to address the remaining points from the reviewers in a revision that we anticipate should not take you very long. We will then assess your revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments with our Academic Editor aiming to avoid further rounds of peer-review, although we might need to consult with the reviewers, depending on the nature of the revisions.</p><p>In addition to these revisions, you may need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests shortly. If you do not receive a separate email within a few days, please assume that checks have been completed, and no additional changes are required.</p><p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within 1 month. Please email us (plosbiology@plos.org) if you have any questions or concerns, or would like to request an extension. </p><p>At this stage, your manuscript remains formally under active consideration at our journal; please notify us by email if you do not intend to submit a revision so that we withdraw the manuscript.</p><p>**IMPORTANT - SUBMITTING YOUR REVISION**</p><p>Your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer. Please submit the following files along with your revised manuscript:</p><p>1. A 'Response to Reviewers' file - this should detail your responses to the editorial requests, present a point-by-point response to all of the reviewers' comments, and indicate the changes made to the manuscript. </p><p>*NOTE: In your point-by-point response to the reviewers, please provide the full context of each review. Do not selectively quote paragraphs or sentences to reply to. The entire set of reviewer comments should be present in full and each specific point should be responded to individually.</p><p>You should also cite any additional relevant literature that has been published since the original submission and mention any additional citations in your response. </p><p>2. In addition to a clean copy of the manuscript, please also upload a 'track-changes' version of your manuscript that specifies the edits made. This should be uploaded as a "Revised Article with Changes Highlighted " file type. </p><p>*Resubmission Checklist*</p><p>When you are ready to resubmit your revised manuscript, please refer to this resubmission checklist: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://plos.io/Biology_Checklist" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.io/Biology_Checklist</ext-link></p><p>To submit a revised version of your manuscript, please go to <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/</ext-link> and log in as an Author.

In both cases, SLAMF5 expression is effectively downregulated in sorted microglial cells, and the comparisons are made between cells that express or do not express SLAMF5."</p><p>The authors title and text claim a specific role for SLAMF5 in regulating myeloid-cell mediated neuroinflammation. To support this conclusion, assays using cell-type specific ablation are critical to inform on cell autonomous functions. The authors data in the global SLAMF5 KO (original Fig 1A-B) showed that animals begin to show EAE clinical symptoms by day 14. The cKO mice are largely (80% of the mice in Fig. 2H,I) protected from EAE disease based on the curve and AUC of zero. Based on the scores, the data suggest that myeloid-specific ablation has a unique difference than global KOs in EAE pathogenesis. In KO mice, given the authors performed flow and RNA-seq experiments on all CD45+CD11b+ cells, which in EAE includes many cell-types and activation states of each of them, cell-specific analysis is required to support such conclusions. How Slamf5 regulates myeloid cell mediated neuroinflammation in EAE remains unclear. In microglia or macrophages, is there any signaling pathways deregulated in Slamf5 dependent manner? The RNA-seq data suggest some, but functional validation studies are not explored, and thus the study remains descriptive as presented. </p><p>The Cx3cr1-CreERT2 strain is widely used for multi-omic studies including the EAE model, one example here (Ennerfelt et al Cell 2022). The rationale to select global knockout strain over cKO approach "to ensure maximal and uniform deletion for transcriptomic analysis" should be addressed as a caveat in discussion.</p><p>Histopathology: I commend the authors for their new experiment and inclusion of histological data from the control and cKO groups. The authors state "We performed spinal cord histology on EAE-induced cKO and control mice, which revealed significantly reduced lymphocyte infiltration in the cKO animals". Did the authors perform image quantification?</p><p>Naive State Comparison: Statistics between na&#239;ve-control and Contorl EAE are not included in Fig 2K, M.</p><p>Reviewer comment 2:</p><p>What role do the authors suggest microglial MHC-II plays in relation to SLAMF5 in EAE? It has been reported microglial MHCII is dispensable during EAE (Wolf et al Eur J Immunol 2018). Since the authors do not distinguish between microglia vs infiltrating myeloid cells in their analyses, how do the authors interpret the contribution of SLAMF5 in microglia vs peripheral myeloid cells?</p><p>Reviewer comment 3: RNA-seq data</p><p>I still find the RNA-seq dataset difficult to interpret. There is 76% gene variance between 1 WT and the KOs, but it is unclear if this is because the authors sorted all CD45+CD11b+ cells from the inflamed CNS of EAE mice. The myeloid composition, and their activation states (microglial states, macrophages states, neutrophil states etc,) change dramatically from onset to peak disease (examples: Jordao et al Science 2019; Mendiola et al Nat Immunol 2020; Peruzzotti-Jametti et al Nature 2024). The selected genes in Fig. 5A support the reduced gene activation in CD45+CD11b+ cells of cKO brains in EAE.</p><p>Additional comments of revised manuscript</p><p>1. The authors tend to present flow cytometric histograms of markers but then the quantification is a cell percentage. Is there a reason why the maker MFI is not presented? For example, but throughout manuscript, Fig 1E, F. </p><p>2. The title suggests a causal role of SLAMF5 in neuroinflammation in MS, which is too strong based on the presented data. A title reflecting MS models or CNS inflammation would be more appropriate.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Reviewer #2: </p><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating, and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that affects over 2 million people worldwide and typically begins in young adulthood. Currently, no treatment can halt disease progression, highlighting the urgent need to better understand its underlying mechanisms in order to develop effective preventive strategies.</p><p>In this study, the authors investigated the expression and function of Factor SLAMF5, a regulator of immune cell function, using an inflammatory mouse model of MS (EAE). They show that totally or partially blocking SLAMF5 function delayed disease onset and reduced progression in this well-established MS model, suggesting SLAMF5 may serve as a therapeutical target in MS. While this research builds on the authors' previous works on the role of SLAMF5 in immune cells, the new findings presented here are of interest.</p><p>In this revised version, the authors have made substantial changes in the manuscript and included newly generated data, that enhance the quality of the work.</p><p>Most of my initial questions and concerns regarding this study have been satisfactorily addressed (except maybe the point "p13: how can the ICV with SLAMF5 blocking antibody and the cKO of SLAMF5 have so drastic effects compared to the SLAMF5 mutant regarding EAE scores? This is a major concern regarding the models used in this study.").</p><p>Consequently, I do not have any major objections to its publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="pbio.3003373.r005"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3003373.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response to Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pbio.3003373" id="rel-obj005" related-article-type="editor-report"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

</p><p>Dear Idit,</p><p>Thank you for your patience while we considered your revised manuscript "SLAMF5 Regulates Myeloid-Cell Mediated Neuroinflammation in Multiple Sclerosis" for publication as a Research Article at PLOS Biology. This revised version of your manuscript has been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors, and the Academic Editor.</p><p>Based on our Academic Editor's assessment of your revision, we are likely to accept this manuscript for publication. However, the Academic Editor requested that you please discuss the caveats of the full KO in the discussion. Please also make sure to address the following data and other policy-related requests.</p><p>a) We routinely suggest changes to titles to ensure maximum accessibility for a broad, non-specialist readership, and to ensure they reflect the contents of the paper. In this case, we would suggest a minor edit to the title, as follows. Please ensure you change both the manuscript file and the online submission system, as they need to match for final acceptance:</p><p>"The immune receptor SLAMF5 regulates myeloid-cell mediated neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis"</p><p>b) Please add the grant number in the Financial Disclosure statement in the manuscript details.</p><p>c) You state that your study does not require an ethics statement. This is incorrect as you perform animal experiments. I also note that in your subsecion "Mice" in the Materials and Methods secsion you say "All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Research Committee of the Weizmann Institute of Science." The Ethics statement needs to be a separate, independent (and the first) subheading in the Material &amp; Methods section. It must include the full name of the IACUC/ethics committee that reviewed and approved the animal care and use, as well as the protocol/permit/project license number. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/ethical-publishing-practice" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/ethical-publishing-practice</ext-link></p><p>d) You may be aware of the PLOS Data Policy, which requires that all data be made available without restriction: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability</ext-link>.
