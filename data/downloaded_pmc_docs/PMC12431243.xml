We searched the Cochrane, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for relevant studies from inception to June 30, 2024. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle&#8211;Ottawa Scale. Dose&#8211;response and conventional meta-analyses were performed using one-stage random-effects and DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models, respectively. Our systematic review included 35 studies with 1,292,052 participants (8,572 cases of cognitive impairment), of which 28 studies were further meta-analyzed. A dose&#8211;response meta-analysis revealed a nonlinear association between time spent watching TV and an increased risk of cognitive impairment (Wald test p-value&#8201;=&#8201;0.04), particularly for viewing durations of &#8805;4 hours per day. Additionally, watching &#8805;6 hours of television per day was associated with a significant decrease in cognitive score (standardized beta coefficient&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.09; 95% CI: &#8722;0.17, &#8722;0.003; I<sup>2</sup>&#8201;=&#8201;71.8%; seven studies). Also, a longer television-watching time was associated with a lower cognitive score (pooled standardized mean difference&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.02; 95% CI: &#8722;0.03, &#8722;0.003; I<sup>2</sup>&#8201;=&#8201;66.45%; six studies). Watching television for a longer period was associated with negative cognitive outcomes in adults and older adults. Further research is needed to confirm this association and elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100016204</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, Thailand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fundamental Fund 2024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1330-4399</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Na-ek</surname><given-names>Nat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016175</institution-id><institution>Chulabhorn Royal Academy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>E2566/170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8135-510X</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Dejakaisaya</surname><given-names>Hattapark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by Chulabhorn Royal Academy and University of Phayao and Thailand Science Research and Innovation Fund (Fundamental Fund 2024).

One of these diseases is dementia, a syndrome with various etiologies causing a decline in cognitive abilities that interferes with activities of daily living, leading to functional impairment. It is the seventh leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and dependency among older adults, according to the World Health Organization [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Moreover, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase from 55 million in 2019&#8211;139 million in 2050 [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This will in turn increase the burden imposed by dementia on the global healthcare system, doubling the associated cost from US$1.3 trillion in 2019 to US$2.8 trillion by 2030 [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>There are more than 100 causes of dementia [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; the most common one is Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD), accounting for &#8805;50% of all cases [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. AD causes a progressive deterioration in two or more cognitive domains, especially episodic memory and executive functions [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], causing patients to suffer from symptoms such as memory loss and spatial disorientation [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, AD may enhance the mortality rate by up to 40% [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] because of complications related to aspiration, infection, or inanition [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. AD can be caused by a myriad of pathological changes in the brain, such as the accumulation of certain amyloid-&#946; peptides [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], neurofibrillary tangles [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], dysfunctional glutamatergic pathways [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and vascular changes [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While a disease-modifying therapy, lecanemab, is available, it only slows the progression of mild AD and is not a curative treatment [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, other types of dementia, such as frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and vascular dementia, lack disease-modifying therapies. As a result, dementia remains incurable [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, risk mitigation remains the most effective strategy to address the global rise in dementia cases.</p><p>Understanding how activities of daily living in adults and older adults affect the risk of developing dementia may provide insights into how the global population can age in a healthier way. Therefore, it is imperative that any positive or negative impact of common daily leisure activities on cognition is identified. Among these common daily leisure activities, television (TV) watching is of particular interest as it is one of the most popular leisure activities among adults and older adults [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. TV watching duration is widely measured to indicate the amount of sedentary behavior a person engages in and, currently, longer TV watching durations are considered to be related to an elevated risk of obesity [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Despite this, there is still no consensus on the impact of TV watching on cognition because there is evidence supporting both positive [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and negative [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] impacts. This discrepancy may partly be explained by differences in study designs and methodological aspects. Furthermore, no previous studies have examined the association between TV watching time and the risk of cognitive impairment as a nonlinear function. The current investigation is therefore warranted, and the aim of this study is to establish whether there is a relationship between TV-watching time and cognitive outcomes in adults and older adults. Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis allows us to examine the impact of methodological differences on the observed association. Additionally, conducting a dose-response meta-analysis enables us to investigate the nonlinear relationship between TV watching time and cognitive outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This report followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023408255).

For inclusion in our meta-analysis, the adults and older adults (&#8805;18 years old) in each study had to be unaffected by serious disability such as visual impairment, auditory impairment, cognitive impairment, or dementia (at the start of the study), and to not be taking drugs that affect cognition. Furthermore, the interventions in the studies had to not involve special types of TV-watching regimens (e.g., TV-based cognitive training programs). All identified records were screened independently by two reviewers (HD, CH): first, the titles and abstracts were screened, followed by the full texts, and relevant information was independently extracted. Any disagreements between the two reviewers were resolved through discussion or by a third reviewer (WM, NN) if necessary.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Data extraction</title><p>We collected data on all cognitive outcomes from individual studies, including cognitive scores on standardized tests and risk data for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.

Briefly, studies were ranked based on 1) the most relevant outcomes (e.g., dementia, cognitive impairment, and cognitive score); 2) sample size (largest); and 3) year of publication (latest), respectively. For articles with multiple levels of television viewing, all data were collected to analyze the dose-response relationship. For studies that report both cognitive score and MCI/dementia risk, we collected both outcomes for their respective meta-analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Assessment of bias of individual studies</title><p>The Newcastle&#8211;Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) was applied to evaluate and analyze the methodological quality of each study [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Three domains were evaluated: selection, comparability, and outcome/exposure assessment. Two reviewers (HD, WM) independently scored studies as low (8&#8211;9 points), moderate (6&#8211;7 points), or high (0&#8211;5 points) risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. A summary of risk levels and visualizations was generated using robvis [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The standard NOS was used for case&#8211;control or cohort studies, whereas a modified scale [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was used for cross-sectional studies. Details of the assessment and risk stratification performed using the NOS can be found in <xref rid="pone.0323863.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 file</xref>. No studies were excluded based on the bias assessment; however, a sensitivity analysis of only studies with a low-to-moderate risk of bias was performed.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Data items.</title><p>Data on the following aspects were extracted from each study: 1) demographics; 2) characteristics of the study population; 3) TV-watching quantification methods; and 4) cognitive outcomes. Detailed data are listed in <xref rid="pone.0323863.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 file</xref>. In studies with multiple levels of TV exposure, we used the reported mean or median to determine the dose (time) of TV watching in each exposure category; otherwise, range values were converted to specific doses according to the method suggested by Shim et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, the standard error and standard deviation of outcomes were derived from the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval (CI) using standard formulas [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Synthesis methods.</title><p>There were two main outcomes in this study: risk of cognitive impairment (i.e., MCI, dementia, or AD) and cognitive score. To perform a dose&#8211;response meta-analysis, a one-stage random-effects model was used [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In brief, we initially created a scatter plot of each outcome (y-axis) and the TV-watching time (x-axis) to visualize the crude association. Then, a linear regression model was fitted. To examine nonlinear associations, we fitted the model with either a quadratic term or a restricted cubic spline with three, four, or five knots, where the location of each knot was specified according to the recommended percentile position [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, we examined nonlinearity with the Wald test. Lastly, we selected the best-fitted model, i.e., with the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The binary outcome (cognitive impairment risk) was analyzed using the Greenland and Longnecker method and a restricted maximum-likelihood random-effects model, whereas for the continuous outcome (cognitive score), dose&#8211;response meta-analysis was performed using Cohen&#8217;s standardized mean difference approach. To avoid duplication issues, we analyzed only one outcome from each study that reported more than one outcome with the same type of variable (continuous or binary), using the following hierarchy: 1) If both cohort and cross-sectional results were reported [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we used the cohort results; 2) If each outcome was reported along with a cumulative one [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], we selected the cumulative one; 3) If both short- and long-term outcomes were reported [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we chose the long-term one; 4) If each outcome was reported separately without a cumulative one [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], we used the outcome with the smallest variance.</p><p>In the conventional meta-analysis, the risk of cognitive impairment was given by a ratio effect size or mean difference, using the shortest TV-watching-time group as the reference group. In contrast, the cognitive score was indicated by a beta coefficient derived from the regression model. Where possible, we used the effect sizes from models that included the most comprehensive set of covariates reported in each primary study to account for potential cofounders such as age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors (e.g., physical activity, smoking), and other comorbidities. These factors, such as older age, female sex and lower education attainment, can negatively affect the cognitive outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Details of covariate adjusted for in each study are provided in <xref rid="pone.0323863.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Because none of the studies reported prevalence data for the outcomes in the reference group or the absolute number of participants experiencing the outcomes in each group, we could not convert hazard ratios to odds ratios (or vice versa). Consequently, all ratio effect sizes (i.e., risk ratio, odds ratio, and hazard ratio) were pooled in the main analysis, primarily using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model, and labeled as relative risk. Additionally, we performed subgroup analysis according to study design, type of outcome, risk of bias, and reported effect size.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0323863.t001" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323863.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>The main characteristics of the 35 studies included in the systematic review categorized by their study designs.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="pone.0323863.t001g" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0323863.t001.jpg"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">1<sup>st</sup> Author, Country, Year [ref]</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Sample size</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Male (%)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Mean age at baseline (years)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Mean follow-up (years)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">TV viewing (CAT/ CON)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Outcome</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Type of cognitive test/ diagnostic method</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Key Finding</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adjusted confounder(s)</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cognitive impairment risk</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cognitive score</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="10" rowspan="1">

Nevertheless, in subgroup analysis, the conventional meta-analysis provided important insights: a longer TV-watching time was associated with a significantly higher risk of AD, and when only hazard ratios were pooled. This points to the need for further studies for clarification because only one study was included in the analysis. Moreover, watching TV for &#8805;6 hours per day was associated with significantly lower cognitive scores. This was also supported by the results of our conventional meta-analysis. However, it must be noted that there was significant heterogeneity between studies regarding this association because of the different study designs.</p><p>In summary, we observed a significant nonlinear increase in the risk of cognitive impairment with TV-watching time and a significant decrease in cognitive scores after 6 hours. This difference might result from the difference in the nature of the two outcomes. The cognitive impairment data were binarized, whereas the cognitive scores were continuous. Moreover, there were differences in follow-up times and cognitive tests among studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Implications of the association between TV watching and worsening cognition</title><p>Our findings are alarming because it has been demonstrated that adults may watch up to 7 hours of TV per day on average [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. If the risk of cognitive impairment significantly increases at 4 hours of TV watching or more, an average adult watching 7 hours of TV per day would have a notably higher risk of cognitive impairment. This becomes even more critical in the context of an aging population, because people tend to watch TV for longer as they get older [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The combination of increased TV-watching time with age and TV watching&#8217;s association with a higher risk of cognitive impairment risk will undoubtedly increase the burden on the economy and public health system. Thus, it is imperative that alternative leisure activities are recommended for adults and older adults.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Mechanisms linking TV watching to cognition</title><p>Evidence from the literature suggests that there is a direct association between TV watching and decreased brain volume in several parts of the brain, including parts related to language, memory, and communication that are usually affected by dementia [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This association persists even after adjusting for possible confounders such as physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], suggesting that there is a direct mechanism linking TV watching and cognitive impairment. Indirect effects of TV watching may also contribute to the association observed in this study. TV-watching time is often used as an indicator of how long a person is engaged in sedentary activity per day, and it has an inverse relationship with physical activity time [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Both TV watching and sedentary activity are associated with worse cognitive performance and cognitive impairment [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Furthermore, TV viewing is linked to diseases such as obesity and diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], as well as negative psychosocial outcomes such as loneliness, depression, and low life satisfaction, which could also increase dementia risk [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Although further studies are required to confirm the association, our study is the first meta-analysis to show a negative association between watching TV and cognitive outcomes. On an individual level, patients could be advised regarding the potential cognitive benefits of decreasing the time spent viewing TV because each hour of TV watching increases the risk of cognitive impairment. Additionally, regardless of whether TV watching is a causal factor in cognitive impairment, people (especially older adults) who spend most of their time watching TV may still benefit from monitoring and evaluation of cognitive impairment. Our findings could also inform public health strategies to dissuade adults and older adults from watching TV to improve their cognitive health, and they emphasize the need for adults to engage in other cognitive and daily leisure activities; public health providers could use this information to devise policies aimed at improving cognitive health. Since this study focuses on the relationship between TV watching (a commonly used marker for sedentary behavior) and cognition, it may be possible to apply the results from this study to similar sedentary activities, such as watching internet videos and using streaming platforms. However, it is important to note the different variables associated with each type of sedentary activity, for example, some activities may be more appealing to certain age and gender groups than others. In addition, some activities, such as watching internet videos, might be associated with a higher degree of interaction with the user than watching television. Factors such as these may alter the relationship between different sedentary behavior and cognition [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, the results from this study must be extrapolated with caution.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To our best knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively review and meta-analyze the associations of TV-watching time with cognitive scores and cognitive impairment risk. Furthermore, we performed a dose&#8211;response meta-analysis to potentially identify a nonlinear trend that may not be captured by the conventional analytic approach. However, there are some noteworthy limitations to this study. First, all the included studies were observational in design, meaning that several alternative explanations&#8212;particularly the influence of residual confounders and reverse causality (e.g., individuals in the subclinical stage of cognitive impairment may spend most of their time watching TV due to physical limitations)&#8212;cannot be ruled out. Therefore, causality cannot be inferred from our findings. Nonetheless, reverse causality is not a major concern in our study. This is because the dose&#8211;response meta-analysis findings on time spent watching TV and the risk of cognitive impairment are based solely on cohort studies, which are less prone to reverse causality compared to cross-sectional studies (<xref rid="pone.0323863.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). Additionally, most of the included cohort studies (66.7%) were assessed as having a low risk of reverse causality in one domain of the NOS. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis of the dose-response meta-analysis for cognitive scores based on cohort studies yielded results consistent with the main analysis (<xref rid="pone.0323863.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). Second, some results showed a significant degree of heterogeneity. Consequently, for some findings, the certainty of the evidence was rated as low to very low according to GRADE, such that readers should exercise caution when interpreting the findings. Our subgroup and sensitivity analyses (<xref rid="pone.0323863.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) suggest that study design, outcome type, reported effect sizes, and risk of bias were not the primary contributors to the heterogeneity. This persistent heterogeneity across subgroups suggests that other factors, such as unmeasured confounders, may contribute. These may include differences in TV assessment methods (e.g., self-reported hours vs. categorical measures), regional variations in viewing habits, and the use of different cognitive measures and scales (e.g., Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) vs. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) vs self-report). These factors likely contributed to variability beyond study design or risk of bias; thus, the pooled estimates should be interpreted with caution. Interestingly, in the leave-one-out analysis, one study by Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323863.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] appears to be a potential influential source. This is because the exclusion of the study shifts the pooled estimate, suggesting it contributes to observed heterogeneity. The apparent funnel-plot asymmetry is more plausibly driven by between-study heterogeneity and variation in study precision than by small-study publication bias. In addition, our comprehensive search strategy&#8212;covering six major databases (Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science)&#8212;reduces the likelihood that relevant studies were missed, further minimizing the chance that publication bias explains the pattern observed. Third, this study focused on adults and older adults, so its findings may not be applicable to younger populations (&lt; 18 years old). Fourth, it should be noted that forest plots with a limited number of studies (e.g., subgroup analyses with &#8804;2 studies) as shown in <xref rid="pone.0323863.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> should be interpreted with caution. P-values may not reliably indicate true between-group differences under these conditions. Lastly, although we used fully adjusted estimates where available, residual confounding remains a key limitation due to variability in covariates across studies and potential unmeasured factors such as social engagement, depression, or baseline cognitive status.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Conclusion and future directions</title><p>Determining the relationship between the most popular leisure activity among adults and older adults, TV watching, and cognitive outcomes has never been more important because the world is heading towards an aging population crisis. The current evidence supports an association between longer TV-watching time and negative cognitive outcomes in adults and older adults; however, causality in the relationship remains to be fully elucidated. Additionally, future studies should consider the relationship between different types of TV programming on cognitive decline in adults as there is currently a lack of evidence on this specific topic. Nevertheless, this study has established that the answer to the question of how long one can spend watching TV per day without hindering cognitive performance is less than 4&#8211;6 hours in adults and older adults. The findings of this study could be used as a basis for public advice pertaining to healthier aging.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec025" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323863.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>ROBVIS: Risk-of-bias VISualization for cross-sectional studies.</title><p>(A) Traffic Light Plot for risk of bias domains.

Therefore, causality cannot be inferred from our findings.&#8221; This use of the term , causality, by the authors is inappropriate as the effect size measures in this study and most statistical studies involves evidence of association and not causality. Thus causality is not in play, especially in a meta-analysis, which is primarily exploratory or suggestive. The authors note correctly themselves that regarding the association between TV-watching time and cognitive score, they found a nonlinear relationship via a three-knot restricted cubic spline model, which was the best-fitting model in the dose&#8211;response meta-analysis according to the AIC and BIC in Table 3 of the supplement. Likewise, they give the same quantitative interpretation correctly for the Analysis of the risk of cognitive impairment via the term association. That is as far as they can go in the interpretation.

The authors note in the analysis portion that, where possible, fully adjusted effect sizes were used. This is not clear . What adjustment? There is reference to confounders and causes for a weak or strong association in some cases. However, there is no real detailed evidence of relevant confounder discussion (clinical or demographic in addition to the self report limitations noted by the authors) in the text or supplement.

The topic is of significant relevance, the PRISMA checklist is followed, and the supplement is comprehensive. The inclusion of dose&#8211;response analyses and a large data set are major strengths.

Reviewer #1: The paper is interesting. However, there are some concerns from a statistical perspective. Certainty of findings grade in supplement were all very low to moderate concerning evidence of certainty which may indicate that the association sought by the investigators is not very strong.</p><p>1.1 All the included studies were observational in design, meaning that the authors had doubt of the associations examined as they note, &#8220;particularly the influence of residual confounders and reverse causality (e.g., individuals in the subclinical stage of cognitive impairment may spend most of their time watching TV due to physical limitations)&#8212;cannot be ruled out.

We acknowledge the limitations of observational studies and agree that our findings can only indicate associations, not causality. In response to the reviewer&#8217;s concern, we have revised the manuscript to remove or rephrase any mention of "causality" to ensure that the interpretation of our results remains within the appropriate scope of observational research. Specifically, we now consistently use the term &#8220;association&#8221; throughout the manuscript to reflect the nature of the evidence.</p><p>1.2 In general the synthesis of the findings and its organization was done and interpreted correctly including the risk of bias assessment.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comment.</p><p>1.3. The analysis requires much clarification. The authors note in the analysis portion that, where possible, fully adjusted effect sizes were used. This is not clear . What adjustment? There is reference to confounders and causes for a weak or strong association in some cases. However, there is no real detailed evidence of relevant confounder discussion (clinical or demographic in addition to the self report limitations noted by the authors) in the text or supplement.</p><p>To improve clarity, we have now explained the logic behind using the fully adjusted effect sizes (page 8, para 2) and listed the covariates adjusted for in each included study in Table 1:</p><p>&#8220;Where possible, we used the effect sizes from models that included the most comprehensive set of covariates reported in each primary study to account for potential cofounders such as age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors (e.g. physical activity, smoking), and other comorbidities. These factors, such as older age, female sex and lower education attainment, can negatively affect the cognitive outcomes [40]. Details of covariate adjusted for in each study are provided in Table 1.&#8221;</p><p>1.4. Also, the I squares are given with p-values in the Figures 2 and 3 or in the supplement with no explanation of the causes of significance , if any. The funnel plots are well done and presented in the supplement. However, the asymmetry (Figure 7A) should be explained. Also, the authors should explain in more detail the difference in the graphical presentations of Supplementary Figures 6 and 7 vs. Supplementary Figures 8 and 9.</p><p>We have now added the following text to discuss the significant heterogeneity, suggested by I&#178; and its p-values, on page 27, para 1:</p><p>&#8220;Second, some results showed a significant degree of heterogeneity. Consequently, for some findings, the certainty of the evidence was rated as low to very low according to GRADE, such that readers should exercise caution when interpreting the findings. Our subgroup and sensitivity analyses (Table 2) suggest that study design, outcome type, reported effect sizes, and risk of bias were not the primary contributors to the heterogeneity. This persistent heterogeneity across subgroups suggests that other factors, such as unmeasured confounders, may contribute. These may include differences in TV assessment methods (e.g., self-reported hours vs. categorical measures), regional variations in viewing habits, and the use of different cognitive measures and scales (e.g., MMSE vs. MoCA vs self-report). These factors likely contributed to variability beyond study design or risk of bias; thus, the pooled estimates should be interpreted with caution. Interestingly, in the leave-one-out analysis, (Zhang et al., 2023 [66]) appears to be a potential influential source, as its exclusion shifts the pooled estimate, suggesting it contributes to observed heterogeneity.&#8221;</p><p>Regarding the asymmetry of the funnel plot (Supplementary Figure 7), Egger&#8217;s test indicated no statistically significant publication bias (p-value = 0.43). The asymmetry is more likely to be driven by between-study heterogeneity and variation in study precision.</p><p>The Egger&#8217;s test result is stated on page 23, para 1 as follows:</p><p>&#8220;Visual inspection of the contour-enhanced and conventional funnel plots for cognitive-impairment risk (S7A &amp; B Fig) suggested some asymmetry; however, Egger&#8217;s test indicated no statistically significant publication bias (p-value = 0.43).&#8221;</p><p>The cause of asymmetry is discussed on page 28, para 1:</p><p>&#8220;The apparent funnel-plot asymmetry is more plausibly driven by between-study heterogeneity and variation in study precision than by small-study publication bias. In addition, our comprehensive search strategy&#8212;covering six major databases (Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science)&#8212;reduces the likelihood that relevant studies were missed, further minimizing the chance that publication bias explains the pattern observed.&#8221;</p><p>The graphical differences between Supplementary Figures 6-9 reflect the different outcomes assessed. We have now changed the figure legend for Supplementary Figure 6 to further explain the graph as follows:</p><p>&#8220;S6 Fig. Scatter Plot of TV Watching Time (dose; x) and the Change in Cognitive Score (beta coefficient; y). Each circle depicts the beta coefficient and inver_se of the change in cognitive score at each dose of TV watching time reported in each study.&#8221;</p><p>Supplementary Figures 7 and 8 showed funnel plots with and without contour enhancements to evaluate potential publication bias for cognitive impairment risk and cognitive scores, respectively. The difference is stated on page 23, para 1 as follows:</p><p>&#8220;Visual inspection of the contour-enhanced and conventional funnel plots for cognitive-impairment risk (S7A &amp; B Fig) suggested some asymmetry; however, Egger&#8217;s test indicated no statistically significant publication bias (p-value = 0.43). Likewise, both the contour-enhanced funnel plot (S8A Fig) and the classical funnel plot (S8B Fig) of the cognitive score outcome also showed no apparent evidence of publication bias, with a p-value of 0.56 derived from Egger&#8217;s test.&#8221;</p><p>Supplementary Figure 9 shows leave-one-out sensitivity analyses for both outcomes, illustrating the influence of individual studies on the overall pooled estimates. The leave-one-out analysis is explained on page 9, para 2:</p><p>&#8220;Additionally, the influence of each study was examined by performing a leave-one-out analysis.&#8221;</p><p>And the result of the Supplementary Figure 9 has been discussed on page 23, para 1:</p><p>&#8220;In the leave-one-out analysis (S9 Fig), although most studies did not influence the findings, three studies might have dominated the main results. Omitting one study (Zhang et al., 2023 [66]) from the meta-analysis of cognitive impairment risk (S9A Fig) changed the results from null to significant (1.07 [95% CI: 1.01, 1.12]). In contrast, leaving out either of two studies (Shin et al., 2021 [63] and Maasakkers et al., 2021 [58]) in the meta-analysis of cognitive score reverted the results to null (S9B Fig).&#8220;</p><p>1.5. Also, there should be a caution about few cross sectional studies on the Forest plots (Figure 3B) and care in interpreting the p-values when there are so few studies on a Forest plot. The entire document should be edited to be sure relevant detail is provided to the reader.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer. We have added the following sentence to the limitation section in our discussion (page 28, para 1):</p><p>&#8220;Fourth, it should be noted that forest plots with a limited number of studies (e.g., subgroup analyses with &#8804;2 studies) as shown in Fig 3B should be interpreted with caution. P-values may not reliably indicate true between-group differences under these conditions.&#8221;</p><p>2. Reviewer #2: The manuscript presents a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between television watching and cognitive outcomes in adults and older adults. The topic is of significant relevance, the PRISMA checklist is followed, and the supplement is comprehensive. The inclusion of dose&#8211;response analyses and a large data set are major strengths. To improve transparency, reproducibility, and reader accessibility, I have several suggestions as detailed below. Overall, this is a valuable and important manuscript that will benefit from greater clarity and integration of its supplementary material.</p><p>2.1 Methods</p><p>2.1.1 Data Extraction: Please summarize the outcome selection hierarchy and its rationale in the main Methods for clarity.

</p><p>Response to Reviewers</p><p>PONE-D-25-04250R1</p><p>Television watching and cognitive outcomes in adults and older adults: A systematic review and dose&#8211;response meta-analysis of observational studies</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>1. Reviewer #1: Comments have been addressed. Please do not associate significance with a result unless it is a statistically significant result. For example "Additionally, watching &#8805;6 35 hours of television per day was associated with a significant decrease in cognitive score (standardized 36 beta coefficient = -0.09; 95% CI: -0.17, 0.003; I&#178; = 71.8%; seven studies)." The CI here includes zero and the result is not significant. Please adjust accordingly and other edits as may be needed.</p><p>Thank you for carefully reviewing our manuscript and for providing valuable comments to improve it. Upon further examination, we found that the confidence interval had been reported incorrectly: the minus sign was inadvertently omitted. It should read &#8211;0.17 to &#8211;0.003, rather than &#8211;0.17 to 0.003, as confirmed in the Results section (page 21, line 261) and Supplementary Table 5. We have also reviewed the entire manuscript to ensure the accuracy of all reported results.</p><p>2. Reviewer #2: Thank you for sharing this new version of the manuscript. There are still a few minor comments I would like to highlight:</p><p>2.1 Review the numbering of figures. For example, there are two &#8220;Fig 1&#8221; referenced in the text (e.g., "Fig 1. Prisma flow diagram of study selection" and "Fig 1. The relationship between longer TV watching time and risk of cognitive impairment").</p><p>Thank you for this input. We have reviewed the numbering of figures as requested and ensure that all the figures referenced in the text are accurate.</p><p>2.2 Please review the text for consistency in the number of studies and participants included in the systematic review. The abstract and results report the same numbers, but the discussion gives different figures. Abstract/Results: &#8220;35 studies with 1,292,052 participants&#8230;&#8221; Discussion: &#8220;34 studies with a total of 1,246,876&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>Thank you for identifying this discrepancy between the two sentences. We have made the necessary changes across the manuscript to ensure the consistency of number of studies included. Specifically, we changed the number in the discussion to match the number from abstract and results. The sentence now read &#8220;Our study is the first meta-analysis to explore the association between TV-watching time and cognitive outcomes in adults and older adults; it included 35 studies with a total of 1,292,052 participants.&#8221; (page 24, line 301).</p><p>2.3 Please spell out abbreviations such as MMSE and MoCA at first mention in the text.</p><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. In addition to the list of abbreviations at the footnote of Table 1, we have now spelled out abbreviations such as MMSE and MoCA in the &#8220;Strengths and Limitations&#8221; section (page 27, line 393) of the &#8220;discussion&#8221;. The sentence now read &#8220;These may include differences in TV assessment methods (e.g., self-reported hours vs. categorical measures), regional variations in viewing habits, and the use of different cognitive measures and scales (e.g., Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) vs. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) vs self-report).&#8221;.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0323863.s019" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response_to_Reviewers_auresp_2.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0323863.s019.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0323863.r005" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323863.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Rotstein</surname><given-names initials="A">Anat</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Anat Rotstein</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Anat Rotstein</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0323863" id="rel-obj005" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

When these have been addressed, you&#8217;ll receive a formal acceptance letter and your manuscript will be scheduled for publication.</p><p>
<bold>Please make the following minor edits when proofing:</bold>
</p><p>1. Please delete the sentence beginning in line 103 ending in line 104 as it is repeated twice ("Two reviewers (HD, CH) extracted the relevant information independently, and disagreements</p><p>were resolved by discussion, or by a third reviewer (WM, NN) if necessary").</p><p>2. Line 375, please&#160;use analytic instead of analysis ("Furthermore, we performed a dose&#8211;response meta-analysis to potentially identify a nonlinear trend that may not be captured by the conventional ANALYTIC approach.")</p><p>3. Rephrase the sentence starting in mid-line 398 for clarity (Interestingly, in the leave-one-out analysis, (Zhang et al., 2023 [66]) appears to be a potential influential source, as its exclusion shifts the pooled estimate, suggesting it contributes to observed heterogeneity.)</p><p>An invoice will be generated when your article is formally accepted.
