These included: (1) demographic characteristics; (2) prior research experience; (3) mobility factors (eg, use of mobility aids, driving frequency); (4) technology ownership (eg, smartphones, tablets, home Wi-Fi); (5) social media use (eg, frequency of engagement with platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok); (6) willingness to contribute different types of data across categories, including activities, sensors, and metadata; (7) opinions about data control and privacy options (eg, data deletion, stream-specific control); and (8) willingness to interact with assistive technologies such as robots, for Instrumental Activities of Daily Living.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The final cohort (N=1489) had a mean age of 35.5 years (SD 12.0), was 44% female (n=652), and predominantly identified as White (76%, n=1134), with high rates of smartphone ownership (99%, n=1479) and home Wi-Fi access (98%, n=1464). Participants were most willing to share data streams with clear health implications and least willing to share data streams with greater privacy or reidentification potential (eg, GPS location, in-vehicle dashcam footage). On average, people were willing to complete ambulatory cognitive assessments for 56.7 (SD 36.2) days, air quality monitoring for 58.1 (SD 37.7) days, and GPS location monitoring for 37 (SD 39.0) days. People expected control over their data, including the ability to delete all or specific streams of the data contributed for research. Most participants prioritized control over their data, with 71% (n=1061) favoring the ability to delete all data contributed for research purposes. Stream-specific data deletion (65%, n=960) and time-specific deletion (44%, n=653) were also valued; interest in sharing data with insurance providers (30%, n=453) or caregivers (26%, n=384) was notably lower.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Findings have implications for the design of digital health technologies and education-related to the use and implications of collected data.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>mHealth</kwd><kwd>privacy</kwd><kwd>smartphones</kwd><kwd>sensors</kwd><kwd>acceptability</kwd><kwd>mobile health</kwd><kwd>attitudes</kwd><kwd>opinions</kwd><kwd>digital health technologies</kwd><kwd>online survey</kwd><kwd>surveys</kwd><kwd>data privacy</kwd><kwd>questionnaires </kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Background</title><p>Digital health technologies, including app-based cognitive and psychosocial assessments and wearable sensor-based health monitoring devices, are pervasive and crucial for better understanding and predicting trajectories related to important public health outcomes such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and related dementias. The availability of detailed sensor data streams and data available via application programming interfaces creates new opportunities for scientific discovery, especially considering that passively collected data may be more robust for measuring aspects of daily life that can be influenced by observation, memory interference, or retrospective biases. The increase in easily shareable metadata (eg, Google Takeout) also creates a new fruitful avenue for research, however the extent public awareness and willingness to share these data and from other data streams remains unclear. Past studies have shown that in general, the overall acceptance for various smartphone-based tasks and sensing modalities is low, with variations in type of activity and sensor [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, repeated prompting for specific data streams has been shown to increase willingness to share [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In general, participants are interested in learning from their own data, and a proportion of these are also interested in sharing their information with a health care provider [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Privacy, Security, and Data Controls</title><p>Critical to understanding mechanisms driving willingness to share various data streams are concerns about data privacy, security, and control over generated data [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]Once the data are collected, different members of a research team, often across different institutions, work with deidentified versions of the datasets. In some cases, data are stored indefinitely for algorithm development&#8212;seeking new purposes or uses for the data that were not originally considered. In other cases, advances in machine learning have made it possible to reidentify individuals with enough precision to warrant security concerns over warehousing sensitive data without appropriate deidentification procedures [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). As such, it is imperative to consider the most important stakeholder, the respondent and to assess their expectations regarding the data they generate for research and the level of controls they expect.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Assessment: Active vs Passive?</title><p>To answer important scientific questions, researchers are interested in collecting data across the spectrum of participant involvement and burden, ranging from active data collection activities (eg, completing a survey, cognitive assessments), to passive data collection (eg, extracting sensor data streams, reading existing metadata [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Passive data collection methods refer to data captured automatically without participant effort (eg, sensors, metadata), whereas active methods require participant involvement (eg, completing surveys or assessments). Active data collection also requires input from the respondent in a manner that makes the goal of the research more apparent. On the other hand, passive assessment does not requiring respondent burden or input, but rather, relies on data that is collected continuously in the background.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title> Active-passive continuum of research data streams: activities, sensors, and metadata (examples listed for each data stream category).</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="formative-v9-e64082-g001.jpg"/></fig><p>In general, the mechanisms driving willingness to contribute various data, irrespective of specific study demands, sponsors, and incentives [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] remain unclear.

In addition to the study background language, we the potential participants were informed: &#8220;This survey is designed to learn more about your attitudes and opinions related to digital health technologies and related data/data-sharing.&#8221; Two participants did not consent to participate, and 18 did not complete the survey and were dropped from the study, resulting in a total of 1489 participants with a mean age of 35.5 (SD 11.97) years.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>This work was carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Central Florida approved the study protocol described in this manuscript (IRB No: STUDY00002281). The survey was pilot tested by members of the research laboratory conducting the study, for issues of usability and technical functioning. The IRB determined this study as exempt from regulation for human subjects research. Participants were provided an opportunity to accept or refuse consent before beginning this voluntary survey. The consent form indicated the expected time commitment, compensation, and nature of study. If consent was refused, the survey would close for that participant. Participants received US $2 after completing the survey on the Prolific Research Platform. All data was deidentified; the authors are accountable for all aspects of the work (including full data access, integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis) in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Materials and Design</title><p>Participants completed a battery of questionnaires via the Qualtrics survey platform, designed to assess sample demographic characteristics (eg, technology ownership, mobility), opinions about data control, and willingness to contribute various data for research.

Participants were most willing to share data from active data collection activities and were least willing to share passive data streams (eg, sensors, metadata). People&#8217;s willingness to share data that has obvious health implications replicates prior findings in this area [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and underscores the necessity of education on the relevance of each data stream to health outcomes, if it is to be considered and adopted by research participants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>RQ2: How Long Are People Willing to Contribute Critical Data Streams?</title><p>On average, participants are willing to share data for up to 37 days, though this varied by data stream assessed. Willingness to share GPS location data was lowest, highlighting participant privacy concerns associated with data that may be more sensitive or identifiable, as was seen with the Strava data leak [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). In contrast, daily cognitive assessments and ambulatory air quality monitoring, were similarly endorsed, further supporting engagement with data streams with clear health implications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>RQ3: What Controls and Feedback Do People Expect From Their Data?</title><p>Most participants endorsed the desire to delete all or specific streams of research data contributed by them. Although these data-related protections are required as per IRB regulations, most digital health technologies used for research do not necessarily have a straightforward method using which a person may delete their contributed data. This often requires a direct communication with the research group and a manual backend process. Future iterations of app- and cloud-based digital health technologies may want to consider affording the data provider (ie, the participant) more control over their data, including ways to download, remove data as desired, as well as mechanisms by which they can easily share data with key stakeholders in their life (eg, family or physician). Google Takeout is a platform through which Google account users can export all data originating from Google applications. In this study, only 14% individuals were aware of this tool, highlighting the need for data sharing education. Regarding various data usage scenarios, participants were mostly uncomfortable with unknown data use scenarios and reidentification, and comfortable with data being used to develop therapies and diagnoses, especially for the original purpose. Interestingly, participants reported mixed responses about their ratings of comfort, in regard to data being used by external collaborators. These findings highlight the importance of being transparent with participants on the various ways the data are being used&#8212;as not all data use scenarios are seemingly acceptable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Limitations and Future Directions</title><p>Although a large sample (ie, of approximately 1500 respondents) was recruited for this study, a major limitation is that participant demographics indicate a recruitment bias toward midlife, highly educated (69% have associates degree or higher), White participants (76%, n = 1134), and individuals active on online research platforms. As participation required familiarity with digital interfaces and online survey platforms, the sample may not adequately reflect the views of individuals with low technology adoption rates&#8212;particularly those in rural or socioeconomically disadvantaged communities [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Future research should consider probing similar research questions, leveraging a representative and more diverse sample of respondents, especially considering past research has shown differential willingness to share various data as a function of education and minority status. The extent to which older adults (ie, &gt;60 years) are aware of and are willing to participate by sharing sensor data and metadata is unclear. Older adults were sparsely represented in this sample, limiting insight into the acceptability of sensor-based monitoring among individuals most likely to benefit from digital health interventions (eg, including those aimed at chronic disease mitigation or cognitive decline). Age-related factors such as cognitive load, sensory impairments, or comfort with technology may interact with perceived burden; however, these nuances were not explored in this study.</p><p>In addition, this study did not directly measure aspects of personality, or expectations for data privacy&#8212;two factors likely to explain variance in willingness to share data across the spectrum of participant burden. Participants&#8217; decisions may have been influenced by recent media exposure or personal experiences related to data breaches or algorithmic discrimination, but these factors were not assessed. It is expected that awareness of specific events that highlight the reidentification potential of various sensitive data (eg, GPS) may moderate willingness to share sensitive data, along with the personality constructs of openness and consciousness [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Importantly, the study relies on self-reported, hypothetical willingness to share data, which may not correspond with real-world behavior, particularly when actual study conditions involve real data collection amidst daily life schedules and hassles. Future work should validate these findings in live digital health trials to assess whether stated willingness translates to actual participation and data-sharing compliance. This study aimed to elucidate the types of data and control measures that participants expect in research. These findings can guide the optimization of study protocols to enhance participant engagement, data quality, and minimize participant burden. Ensuring participant privacy is paramount, and researchers have a duty to transparently communicate the rationale for data collection and its potential benefits. As researchers intend to collect rich data across the Active-Passive data continuum (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), our participant&#8217;s privacy comes first, and it is our duty to inform them why we collect the data we do. This approach will foster trust and encourage greater participation in research involving potentially sensitive data streams.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SAP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2196/64082</object-id><label>Multimedia Appendix 1</label><caption><title>Data for the willingness to participate, and share various streams.</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="formative-v9-e64082-s001.docx" xlink:title="DOCX File, 26 KB" id="d67e565" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>NR was previously affiliated with the University of Central Florida and is now at Penn State University.
