In this study, we assessed the effects of phytohormones on growth of <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic> at various culture stages using roots and hypocotyls as explants and established an efficient micropropagation system. The highest callus induction of hypocotyl (75.0%) was obtained using Murashige and Skoog medium containing 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA), 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 1.0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + 1-naphthylacetic acid (NAA), and 0.4 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.

Introduction</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Iris laevigata</italic>, commonly referred to as Japanese water iris, is a perennial herbaceous flowering plant of the family Iridaceae, which has gained increasing attention in recent years. In the wild, this aquatic plant is primarily found alongside rivers, marshes, and wetlands in China, Japan, South Korea, and Russia [<xref rid="B1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Due to its gorgeous blue flowers, which are larger than many <italic toggle="yes">Iris</italic> species, it is regarded as a plant with high ornamental value. It has a long history of cultivation in northeastern China and many renowned botanical gardens around the world [<xref rid="B2-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition to its landscape applications, <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic> is also the parent of many popular horticultural varieties; therefore, it is considered to be a significant genetic resource for <italic toggle="yes">Iris</italic> breeding. Because of its native ecological origin, it exhibits a strong tolerance to cold and waterlogged conditions. These physiological characteristics make it a valuable germplasm resource for developing new ornamental <italic toggle="yes">Iris</italic> cultivars, which can be adapted to waterlogged and cold conditions in different landscaping areas [<xref rid="B3-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The increasing loss and damage of its habitats, however, pose a critical challenge to the survival of native wild populations. As such, it has been defined as one of the second-grade endangered species in South Korea [<xref rid="B6-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, <italic toggle="yes">Iris</italic> reproduces either by bulbs or the splitting of rhizomes. However, vegetative propagation through bulbs or rhizome splitting is generally slower compared to growing from seeds. It may take a few years for divided clumps to mature and produce a substantial number of flowers. Propagation by seed can also be challenging as seeds require a cold stratification period and plants can often take several years to reach maturity from a seed. Furthermore, due to the limitations of cross-pollination and seed germination, sexual reproduction cannot achieve efficient large-scale propagation [<xref rid="B7-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Both sexual and asexual propagation can also be limited by the season and the state of plant growth.</p><p>Micropropagation or tissue culture is a common propagation method used to generate new offspring rapidly for ornamental horticulture applications. It is also a viable strategy for increasing the number of individuals ex situ to save endangered species [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, the establishment of a callus formation and whole-plant regeneration system is also one of the basic requirements for genetically engineering and further developing plant genetic resources [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that it is more difficult to culture Iridaceae in vitro compared to other monocotyledonous plants such as Amaryllidaceae, Araceae, and Liliaceae [<xref rid="B7-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B11-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The cell differentiation of monocotyledons, including <italic toggle="yes">Iris</italic>, starts early and proceeds rapidly, limiting the explant source to only the meristematic region and adjacent tissues. This hinders the establishment of in vitro regeneration systems for <italic toggle="yes">Iris</italic> [<xref rid="B7-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The composition of plant growth regulators (PGRs) in the growth medium is also one of the most important factors affecting in vitro propagation. For decades, the in vitro propagation of several <italic toggle="yes">Iris</italic> species with high ornamental value or danger of extinction (<italic toggle="yes">I. germanica</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I. ensata</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I. pallida</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I. pseudacorus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I. pumila</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I. setosa</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I. sibirica</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I. versicolor</italic>, etc.) has been achieved using anthers, bulbs, flowers, inflorescences, leaves, ovaries, roots, twin scales, and shoots [<xref rid="B7-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B13-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, a reliable system for callus formation and regeneration in <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic> is currently lacking. Therefore, our objective was to develop an efficient callus formation and regeneration system for <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic> to enhance its horticultural and molecular applications and contribute to the conservation of this natural resource.</p><p>In this study, we developed suitable culture media containing PGRs and assessed their suitability for callus induction and adventitious organ induction using two explants, hypocotyl and root. Additionally, the effects of PGRs on different stages of plant regeneration were also studied. The survival efficiency of regenerated plants was used to evaluate and develop an efficient and reliable callus regeneration system for <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-14-02733"><title>2.

Effect of Different PGR Concentrations on I. laevigata Hypocotyl Callus Induction</title><p>Sterile <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic> seedling hypocotyls were used as explants and placed flat on MS medium with different PGR concentrations to induce calli development. The induction and appearance of calli were recorded after 45 days (<xref rid="plants-14-02733-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C,D). As the 6-BA concentration was increased from 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> to 2.0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, the mean induction value initially increased significantly, but at higher concentrations, it began to decrease (<xref rid="plants-14-02733-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The mean induction value exhibited a significant initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease as the concentration of 2,4-D increased from 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> to 1.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (<xref rid="plants-14-02733-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, according to the range analysis (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>), the influence of the PGRs on hypocotyl callus induction was ranked as 6-BA &gt; 2,4-D &gt; NAA. The analysis of variance (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>) indicated that 6-BA and 2,4-D were significant factors involved in the hypocotyl induction (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) while NAA had relatively little influence (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Therefore, multiple comparisons were performed on different levels of 6-BA and 2,4-D, and the results are shown in <xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S2</xref>. The induction rate was highest when the concentration of 6-BA was at K1; thus, the optimal concentration of 6-BA is 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Similarly, the induction rate was highest when the concentration of 2,4-D was K2; thus, the optimal concentration of 2,4-D is 1.0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The rate of callus induction with treatment 2 was 75%, and the condition of the induced calli was good (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S2</xref>). Therefore, the optimal medium for <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic> hypocotyl callus induction was 6-BA 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + 2,4-D 1.0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + NAA 0.4 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + MS + sucrose 30 g L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + agar 7 g L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-plants-14-02733"><title>2.2. Effects of Different PGR Concentrations on I. laevigata Root Callus Induction</title><p>To determine the impact of the three PGRs on <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic> root callus induction, two types of <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic> root explants were investigated. One set of root explants had no secondary roots, while the second set of root explants had secondary roots that were removed. The root explant segments without secondary roots did not produce any calli, irrespective of the phytohormone concentration in the growth medium. Therefore, we focused only on the induction of calli induction in root explants with secondary roots that were originally attached but had been removed prior to induction (<xref rid="plants-14-02733-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="plants-14-02733-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>; <xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S3</xref>).</p><p>The induction process is shown in <xref rid="plants-14-02733-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, where new callus tissue grows at the incision site on the root (<xref rid="plants-14-02733-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C,D). The induction and appearance of calli varied greatly with the PGRs tested (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S3</xref>). When the concentrations of 6-BA and NAA remained constant, the root callus induction increased as the 2,4-D concentration increased, resulting in a single peak curve (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S3</xref>; <xref rid="plants-14-02733-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).

The highest callus induction in the root explants was produced when the media contained 2,4-D at 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and NAA at 0.4 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> with either 0.5 or 2.0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> 6-BA (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S3</xref>; <xref rid="plants-14-02733-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). When the media did not contain 6-BA (treatment 1, 0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), there was no calli induction (0%) for the root explants (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S3</xref>). When either 2,4-D or NAA were absent from the media (treatments 5, 0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>; and treatments 8, 0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), the callus induction was very low, 6.7% and 3.3%, respectively. As a result, although 6-BA had the most significant impact on root callus induction, the presence of low levels of 2,4-D (0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and NAA (0.4 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) were essential for maximizing callus induction (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S3</xref>). Therefore, to produce maximum callus induction with <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic> root explants, the medium used must contain the three PGRs (6-BA, 2,4-D, and NAA). Although the levels of callus induction in treatment 2 (6-BA 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + 2,4-D 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + NAA 0.4 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and treatment 3 (6-BA 2.0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + 2,4-D 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + NAA 0.4 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) were not significantly different (73.3% and 66.7%), treatment 2 required less 6-BA and produced numerically greater callus inductions at 45 d (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S3</xref>). As a result, we choose the following medium formulation for <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic> root callus induction: 6-BA 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + 2,4-D 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + NAA 0.4 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + MS + sucrose 30 g L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + agar 7 g L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-plants-14-02733"><title>2.3. Effects of Different PGRs and Their Concentrations on Adventitious Shoot Induction of Hypocotyl and Root Calli</title><p>Three media formulations were evaluated to determine their impact on the adventitious induction of hypocotyl calli from shoots (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S4</xref>). The highest induction (39.7%) was achieved after 60 days with a medium containing IBA 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + 6-BA 1.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + NAA 1.0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + MS + sucrose 30 g L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + agar 8 g L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S4</xref>). These results confirm that IBA significantly promotes the adventitious induction of hypocotyl calli from shoots. While no adventitious shoots were produced in the media without IBA (<xref rid="plants-14-02733-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A,B), the adventitious shoots were green and strong when 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> IBA was added (<xref rid="plants-14-02733-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C,D).</p><p>Root-induced calli were placed into the adventitious shoot induction media, which included various concentrations of 6-BA, NAA, and KT, and were cultured for 60 days (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S5</xref>). The maximum adventitious shoot induction for root-induced calli was 49.5%, which was achieved with treatment 7 (6-BA 2.0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + NAA 0.4 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + KT 1.0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + MS + sucrose 30 g L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> + agar 8 g L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). The calli produced were green with healthy adventitious shoots (<xref rid="plants-14-02733-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>With the increase in 6-BA concentration, the average differentiation rate increased; with the increase in NAA concentration, the mean differentiation rate decreased; with the increase in KT concentration, the average differentiation rate increased (<xref rid="plants-14-02733-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Combined with the magnitude of the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value in <xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S6</xref> and the range analysis (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S5</xref>), the influence of each factor was ranked as 6-BA &gt; KT &gt; NAA. The analysis of variance indicated that both 6-BA and KT had a significant impact on the adventitious shoot induction (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), while NAA had relatively little influence (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S6</xref>). Therefore, it is proposed that within the concentration range of 0.4&#8211;0.8 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, NAA can effectively support the induction of adventitious shoots from a callus induced by a root. When the concentration of 6-BA was at the K3 level, the rate of adventitious shoot induction reached its highest point, so the optimal concentration of 6-BA is 2.0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Similarly, when the concentration of KT was at the K3 level, the rate of adventitious shoot callus reached its highest point, so the optimal concentration of KT is 1.0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.

Discussion</title><p>The source of explants has a decisive influence on the ability and efficiency of in vitro regeneration. Leaf bases, floral organs, shoots, and roots are often used for callus regeneration in <italic toggle="yes">Iris</italic> species, and the success of induction varied greatly from 39.1% to 80.9% [<xref rid="B7-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B15-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The two explants used here, hypocotyls and roots, showed no significant difference in callus induction (75.0% and 73.3%, respectively) in the current study (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Tables S2 and S3</xref>). Since mature seeds are easy to store, and can be used throughout the year, the sterile explants can be easily obtained from germinating seeds. Although the induction of calli with hypocotyls was not previously reported, this study unequivocally demonstrates that they can be used as explants to induce calli in <italic toggle="yes">Iris</italic> plants.</p><p>In this study, two types of roots were used as explants; root explants with no secondary roots (Type I), and the root explants with secondary roots that had been removed (Type II). Calli were observed to develop from the secondary root excise locations on the Type II explants (<xref rid="plants-14-02733-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), while no calli were induced from the Type I explants. Earlier reports indicated that callus formation induced by the roots of three <italic toggle="yes">Iris</italic> species predominantly originated from lateral root primordia, without specifying the cellular origin as being pericycle cells [<xref rid="B11-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our study showed that calli developed from the incision sites where the secondary roots were cut off (<xref rid="plants-14-02733-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) rather than the incision sites of adventitious roots (<xref rid="plants-14-02733-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) because there were active lateral meristems at site of the red arrow (<xref rid="plants-14-02733-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Type I explants could not induce calli possibly because the pericycle had not dedifferentiated into actively dividing cells of lateral root primordia. No calli were induced at the blue arrow site on the Type II or Type I explants, indicating that the undifferentiated pericycle cells cannot directly produce calli. It seems that the source of explants for <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic> is extremely restrictive, and even using the root tips of sterile seedlings grown for 30 days cannot induce calli.</p><p>The composition of PGRs play an important role in plant regeneration [<xref rid="B17-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The exogenous application of auxin and cytokinin induced calli in various plant species [<xref rid="B19-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Previous reports emphasized the importance of exogenous 2,4-D in the regeneration of some <italic toggle="yes">Iris</italic> species [<xref rid="B7-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B16-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is considered to be the most effective auxin for callus induction [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but it is usually required to prohibit or reduce shoot regeneration [<xref rid="B20-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. When root segments were used to induce calli, the induction was very low when only one auxin (2,4-D or NAA) was used. The combination of the three PRGs (6-BA, 2,4-D, and NAA) was more conducive to callus induction than any combination of two PRGs. The addition of another auxin to the induction medium contributes to the morphogenesis of some <italic toggle="yes">Iris</italic> species. Moreover, different types of auxin lead to different morphogenesis directions [<xref rid="B21-plants-14-02733" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Among the three media we tested for the adventitious induction of hypocotyl shoot calli, treatment 2 (IBA 0.5 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, 6-BA 1.0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, and NAA 0.4 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) was more effective than treatment 1 (6-BA 1.0 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and NAA 0.4 mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, <xref rid="app1-plants-14-02733" ref-type="app">Table S4</xref>). However, we could not determine whether this was due to the characteristics of IBA or the change in the ratio of cytokinin/auxin. In addition, our observations suggest that the induction of <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic> calli is dependent on the exogenous application of 6-BA. Hormone 6-BA (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) was the most significant factor that affected the induction of hypocotyl and root calli, which may be due to the lack of endogenous cytokinin. In addition, both cytokinins (6-BA and KT) had significant effects on the induction of adventitious shoots (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). We deduce that the exogenous cytokinins are more important than exogenous auxins in the in vitro regeneration of <italic toggle="yes">I. laevigata</italic>.
