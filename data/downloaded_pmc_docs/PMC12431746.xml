Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) significantly affects the development and progression of various human tumors. However, the significance and pathological mechanisms of CDKN2A in COAD remain to be elucidated. We assessed expression levels, clinical significance, biological function, co-expressed genes, and enrichment of related pathways of CDKN2A in COAD using various databases, including The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource, Human Protein Atlas, STRING, GeneMANIA, cBioPortal, and Linked Omics. Our investigation showed that CDKN2A was highly expressed in colon adenocarcinomas (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8197;&lt;&#8197;.001). It is weakly expressed or not expressed in normal tissues. The survival time of patients with colon adenocarcinoma with high CDKN2A expression is significantly shorter than that of patients with low expression levels (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8197;=&#8197;.011). There was a significant positive correlation between the expression level of CDKN2A in colon adenocarcinoma tissues and the infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Moreover, there was a significant negative association between the expression level of CDKN2A in colon adenocarcinoma tissues and B cell infiltration. The ten hub genes included tumor protein 53, V-myc Avian Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Homolog, AKT serine/threonine kinase 1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten, cyclin D1, cyclin dependent kinase 4, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, catenin beta 1, and B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase. Mutations in the CDKN2A genome in colon adenocarcinoma reduce survival. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses showed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in apoptotic signaling pathways and multiple pathways related to metabolic progression. Our results indicate that CDKN2A can be used as a marker of poor prognosis in patients with colon adenocarcinoma. CDKN2A may regulate the occurrence and development of colon adenocarcinomas by influencing immune cell infiltration and metabolic pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>CDKN2A</kwd><kwd>colon adenocarcinoma</kwd><kwd>gene</kwd><kwd>tumor</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Colon adenocarcinoma, a common digestive system tumor, has become more prevalent over the past 10 years. Among the 36 types of malignant tumors in 185 countries (regions) in 2020, colon adenocarcinoma ranks fifth.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> In recent years, colon adenocarcinoma has become the second most common cause of adenocarcinoma in China, showing a trend towards younger patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> As the early symptoms of colon adenocarcinoma are not obvious, most cases are detected in advanced stages, and the optimal surgical opportunity is missed. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify key markers for targeted interventions and establish safer and more effective treatment methods. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), located on chromosome 9p21, is a tumor suppressor gene that normally participates in cell cycle regulation and prevents cell proliferation.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> The CDKN2A protein contains 156 amino acids that regulate cell proliferation and inhibit tumor generation in the cell cycle. Inactivation of this gene can lead to the control of cell separation and malignant progression to tumors; however, the specific mechanism remains unclear.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> However, the relationship between the expression of CDKN2A and prognosis and pathological features of colon adenocarcinoma remains unclear. Herein, based on several large public bioinformatics databases, we performed an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the potential value of CDKN2A as a clinical marker and immunotherapeutic target for colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD).</p><p>Our study provides additional data to help clinicians select appropriate treatment drugs and more accurately predict the long-term prognosis of patients with COAD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>2. Methods</title><p>This was a bioinformatic analysis. CDKN2A expression in various tumors was analyzed using the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database (TIMER) (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://timer.cistrome.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://timer.cistrome.org</ext-link>). The screening conditions were as follows: Gene Symbol: CDKN2A. The differential expression of colon adenocarcinoma tissue and adjacent tissues was analyzed using the UALCAN database (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://ualcan.path.uab.edu" ext-link-type="uri">http://ualcan.path.uab.edu</ext-link>), and the differential expression of CDKN2A in colon adenocarcinoma and adjacent tissues was verified using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA2) database (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn/#index" ext-link-type="uri">http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn/#index</ext-link>). Expression analyses of sex, clinical stage, age, and ethnic subgroups of CDKN2A were performed using the UALCAN database. The transcription levels of CDKN2A in different subgroups of colon adenocarcinoma were analyzed using the UALCAN database, and the correlation between CDKN2A expression and pathological stage and prognosis of patients with COAD was analyzed using the GEPIA2.0 database. Patients with COAD were divided into high and low expression groups according to the median expression value of CDKN2A. According to the Cox PH model, the hazard ratio (HR) and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values were calculated, and survival curves were drawn, including the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival curves (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8197;&lt;&#8197;.05). Using the TIMER database, the correlation between CDKN2A expression and various tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including B cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, was analyzed using the gene module. Spearman test showed that the difference was statistically significant. Differences in CDKN2A protein expression between colon adenocarcinoma and normal tissues were analyzed using the Human Protein Atlas database (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>). The protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) network for CDKN2A was constructed using STRING. To supplement the PPI network constructed using STRING (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://string-db.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://string-db.org</ext-link>), we used the GeneMANIA (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://genemania.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://genemania.org/</ext-link>) database to generate and predict gene interactions and visualize the interaction network. The protein PPI network results were downloaded and imported into the Cytoscape software (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://cytoscape.org/index.html" ext-link-type="uri">https://cytoscape.org/index.html</ext-link>) for protein visualization. The top 10 hub genes were identified using CytoHubba. cBioPortal database (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.cbioportal.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.cbioportal.org/</ext-link>) was used to analyze CDKN2A mutations and copy number variations in colon adenocarcinoma. A total of 348 samples were obtained from the cBioPortal database. Based on the Linked Omics database, genes co-expressed with CDKN2A were identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Patients with COAD, including 379 patients with colon adenocarcinoma, were analyzed, and upregulated and downregulated genes related to CDKN2A in COAD were identified. The screening conditions were as follows: COAD, RNA-seq, CDKN2A, RNA-seq, Spearman test for data processing, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8197;&lt;&#8197;.05, which was considered statistically significant, and the top 50 genes with the closest co-expression of different genes were selected to create heat maps. Based on TCGA, a list of colon adenocarcinomas was analyzed using the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses (KEGG) databases, and related entries were obtained and visualized using R package version X.X.X (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>3.

Discussion</title><p>Colon adenocarcinoma is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive tract, with the highest morbidity and mortality,<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> the third most common and second most fatal adenocarcinoma in the world.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery are the treatment choices for most adenocarcinoma patients,<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> and the occurrence and development of adenocarcinoma is often the result of multi-gene and multi-channel mediation. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to explore the key molecules involved in the occurrence and development of colon adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Our data highlighted the value of combining biomarkers to predict COAD prognosis. The UALCAN database established a prognostic risk score model for COAD in the TCGA cohort. The model accurately predicted the OS and PFS of patients with COAD by calculating the risk value of the tumor samples, with the risk score accounting for more than age, sex, stage, and TNM stage. This study provides novel insights into the prognostic value of CDKN2A in COAD. Our findings demonstrated that CDKN2A was negatively associated with B cells, while infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils was positively correlated; the differences were statistically significant in COAD. These findings suggest that tumor immune cell infiltration may contribute to the effects of CDKN2A on COAD.</p><p>The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN2A is a multi-tumor suppressor gene. Through data analysis, this study found that the expression of CDKN2A was upregulated in colon adenocarcinoma and was related to the tumor stage of patients, indicating that the expression of CDKN2A participated in the malignant progression of colon adenocarcinoma. The overall survival rate of patients with high CDKN2A expression was low, indicating that CDKN2A affects patient survival and can be used as a prognostic molecular marker of colon adenocarcinoma. It has been indicated that CDKN2A regulates cells mainly through 2 pathways: the p16INK4a&#8211;CDK4 (and CDK6) -pRb pathway and p14AFP&#8211;MDM2-p53 pathway.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Studies have confirmed that these 2 pathways are abnormal in tumor cells. The deletion, mutation, and methylation of CDKN2A lead to the inability of p16INK4a to bind to CDK4 and CDK6, which leads to the phosphorylation of pRb protein and release of transcription regulator E2F, prolonging the cell cycle and contributing to the occurrence of tumors. Therefore, the ability of CDKN2A to prolong the cell cycle may explain the low overall survival rate of patients with high CDKN2A expression. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy can be affected by tumor immune cell infiltration, which affects the prognostic outcomes of cancer patients. Our findings demonstrate that CDKN2A is markedly negatively associated with B cells and positively associated with macrophages, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and neutrophils in COAD. These findings suggest that tumor immune cell infiltration may contribute to the effects of CDKN2A on COAD. Furthermore, our study highlighted the importance of immune checkpoint expression and adequate immune cell infiltration in enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Therefore, we assessed the association between CDKN2A expression and immune checkpoints.</p><p>Analysis of the PPI network and gene&#8211;gene interaction network and hub gene screening results revealed that CDKN2A, and CDK4, CDK6, MDM2, CDKN2C, and CDKN2D negatively regulate cell cycle G1/S phase transition, mitotic cell cycle G1/S phase transition, mitotic cell cycle G1/S phase transition, mitotic cell cycle phase transition, and cyclin-dependent protein serine/s phase transition. Bioportal analysis showed that mutation in the CDKN2A genome prolongs the cell cycle and contributes to tumor occurrence.</p><p>Gene enrichment analysis showed that CDKN2A participates in many signaling pathways, including the apoptosis, intrinsic apoptosis, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), insulin signaling, and sphingolipid signaling pathways. The full name of mTOR is a mechanical target of rapamycin, a serine/threonine kinase, and an important regulator of cell growth and proliferation.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> The mTOR signaling pathway promotes substance metabolism, participates in apoptosis and autophagy, and plays an important role in many diseases.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> mTOR is an ideal target for tumor treatment as it is a central regulator of proliferation signal transduction.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Sphingolipid metabolism can induce apoptosis, necrotic apoptosis, autophagy, and ER stress by regulating the synthesis or accumulation of ceramides in cells, which can mediate adenocarcinoma cell death.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Genes related to sphingolipid metabolism play key roles in the tumor immune microenvironment and are involved in tumor proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. In sphingolipid metabolism, the activation of the remedial pathway of de novo synthesis of sphingomyelinase, cerebrosidase, ceramide, and sphingosine promotes the death of tumor cells in response to cell stress.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Most metabolic end-products in the sphingolipid pathway are regulated by key enzymes, which provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of colon adenocarcinoma. Therefore, it can be inferred that the CDKN2A gene may be a potential molecular marker of colon adenocarcinoma.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, this study used a bioinformatics method to integrate various data to analyze the expression of CDKN2A in the colon and its influence on the overall survival rate of patients; it initially revealed the molecular significance of CDKN2A in colon adenocarcinoma. However, owing to individual and clinical differences among patients, the follow-up data of patients can only preliminarily show the role of CDKN2A in judging the prognosis of colon adenocarcinoma, and results may be biased. Therefore, further experiments are required for verification in follow-up studies. Second, the potential molecular mechanism of CDKN2A in carcinogenesis was identified by gene enrichment analysis, which needs to be verified by in vivo medical experiments.</p><p>In summary, CDKN2A could be a key marker for predicting the prognosis of COAD and this study could contribute to the study of the immune microenvironment, immunotherapy, and adenocarcinoma-related functions and pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Chen Xu.</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Chen Xu.</p><p><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Chen Xu.</p><p><bold>Funding acquisition:</bold> Chen Xu.</p><p><bold>Software:</bold> Chen Xu.</p><p><bold>Writing &#8211; original draft:</bold> Chen Xu.</p><p><bold>Writing &#8211; review &amp; editing:</bold> Chen Xu.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>
