Their coexistence among households, commonly known as the triple burden of malnutrition (TBM) is a new concept that lacks scholarship within the maternal and child nutrition discourse in Ghana. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the trends and factors associated with TBM among mothers and their children aged 0&#8211;59 months in Ghana. This study combined and analysed datasets from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey from 2003 to 2022. Prevalence and multivariable logistic regression were used to evaluate the trends and determinants of TBM among 11,925 mother-child pairs using complex sample procedures. The pooled prevalence of TBM was 6.7% (5.7 - 6.7). This reduced from 7.6% (6.6 - 8.7) in 2003 to 5.0% (4.1-6.2) in 2022. Male children [AOR 2.23, 95% CI:1.33 - 3.74, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.002] were more likely to suffer TBM than female children. Large birth size [AOR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.17 - 0.54, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001] and breastfed children [AOR 0.13, 95% CI:0.05 - 0.34, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001] were less likely to suffer TBM. Women with no education [AOR 5.14, 95% CI:1.16 - 22.75, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.031] and those with inadequate dietary diversity [AOR 2.53, 95% CI:1.50 - 4.26, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001] were more likely to suffer TBM. Also, high-wealth [AOR 0.13, 95% CI:0.05 - 0.33, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001] and rural households [AOR 0.34, 95% CI: 0.05 - 0.33, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001] were less likely to suffer TBM. Although the prevalence of TBM reduced over the past two decades, the pooled estimate remains high in Ghana. The associated factors include breastfeeding, childbirth size, maternal education, dietary diversity, wealth and urbanicity. Strategies that promote breastfeeding, improve dietary diversity and ensure equitable distribution of resources are urgently needed to mitigate the TBM.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The data for this study are publicly available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://dhsprogram.com/data/available-datasets.cfm" ext-link-type="uri">https://dhsprogram.com/data/available-datasets.cfm</ext-link>.

Malnutrition mainly manifests as micronutrient deficiencies, undernutrition, overweight or obesity primarily among women and children [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Currently, as acknowledged by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the world has to contend with a peculiar nutrition challenge in which individuals are experiencing a concurrent existence of all three forms of malnutrition in the same household. This is commonly known as the triple burden of malnutrition (TBM) [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], a systemic consequence of shared underlying factors emanating from food systems inadequacies and socioeconomic disparities.</p><p>Although a fairly new concept, TBM is gaining traction as a public health concern, with stagnating undernutrition rates, high iron deficiency anaemia rates and significant increases in overnutrition occurring concurrently [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At the global level for instance, one in five children under five years was estimated to be stunted as of 2021, with two in five children and one in three women of reproductive age experiencing anaemia [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Paradoxically, 6% of the world&#8217;s population under five years are overweight and this is projected to reach a staggering 51% by 2035 [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The global prevalence of TBM is imprecise, it is however estimated to be about 12% among low-and-middle-countries (LMICs) and 25% among some Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These rates are notably high particularly when juxtaposed against the provisions of the Sustainable Development Goal 2.2 which enjoins countries to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030 [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. More importantly, LMICs have had the slowest reductions in undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies and remain vulnerable to overnutrition and their concurrent existence [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Malnutrition in all forms poses significant health risks across the lifespan, affecting individuals, families, and the entire population. For instance, undernutrition during childhood has been linked to a higher likelihood of impaired cognitive development, while childhood excess weight is known to increase the risks of chronic non-communicable diseases later in life [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, maternal micronutrient deficiencies and obesity are associated with negative health outcomes for both mother and foetus [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As a result, the existence of maternal micronutrient deficiencies and obesity in an individual could burden health systems and retard progress in achieving nations&#8217; set health and developmental targets.</p><p>While LMICs are more likely to be disproportionately affected by the TBM due to the pronounced effects of a rapid nutrition transition, there is paucity of literature on the factors that drive TBM at the household, maternal and child-level in Ghana. Despite growing recognition of TBM as a public health challenge, research on its long-term trends and underlying factors remains limited. One major gap in the literature is the limited depth of analysis on TBM, with most studies providing only a superficial snapshot without adequately examining medium-to-long-term trends and their cumulative associated factors. For instance, a study analysing a decade of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from 32 SSA countries, Ahinkorah et al., (2021) [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] identified child-related factors such as age, sex, and birth size, as well as maternal factors such as education level, antenatal attendance, and household cooking fuel, as significant influencers of TBM. However, Ahinkorah et al.&#8217;s study was not country-specific enough, making it difficult to apply the conclusions to Ghana. The lack of country-specific data on TBM has made it even more difficult to implement public health approaches aimed at mitigating the consequences of TBM. As a comparatively new concept, with limited scholarship within previous maternal and child malnutrition discourse in Ghana, it is important to ascertain the trend of TBM over the past two decades.</p><p>To address this gap, the present study aimed to evaluate trends in malnutrition and identify the factors associated with the pooled estimate of TBM in Ghana using the Ghana DHS 2003, 2008, 2014 and 2022 datasets. By providing a more comprehensive analysis, this study seeks to inform sustainable solutions for addressing the co-existence of malnutrition, advance scholarly discussions on TBM, and contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2.2 in Ghana.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The ICF and the Ghana Statistical Service submitted all the survey protocols to the Ethical Review Committee of the Ghana Health Service, ensuring compliance with ethical research standards in Ghana.

This comprised the selection of 618 clusters from the sampling frame using probability proportional to size for rural and urban zones. In the second stage sampling, 10&#8211;30 prelisted households were selected using systematic random sampling in each cluster resulting in a maximum of 18,540 households across all 16 regions of Ghana. The allocation of the number of households to be selected in each cluster was also based on probability proportional to size. The number of eligible individuals in all households was 22,580, of whom 22,058 were interviewed in the Ghana DHS 2022.

Due to the lack of data on haemoglobin (Hb) levels, the Ghana DHS 1988, 1993 and 1998 datasets with a total of 17,824 households were excluded from this study. Men aged 15&#8211;59 years and women in households without children aged 0&#8211;59 months were also excluded leaving 12,888 mother-child pairs in their respective households. From 12,888 mother child-pairs, 963 pairs were removed due to missing data on anthropometry and Hb values.

In the 2022 report, anthropometry, i.e., weight and height for eligible women and children 0&#8211;59 months were measured using the SECA 874U Doctor&#8217;s scale and the ShorrBoard&#174; measuring board, respectively. For anaemia testing, capillary blood samples were collected into microcuvette from mothers 15&#8211;49 years who consented as well as children 6&#8211;59 months whose guardians had given consent for the testing.

Additionally, anaemia among children 6 &#8211; 59 months and women 15 &#8211; 49 years were both defined by the Hb concentration where those with Hb&#8201;&lt;&#8201;11.0&#8201;g/dL and Hb&#8201;&lt;&#8201;12.0&#8201;g/dL were termed anaemic, respectively [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For household burdens of malnutrition, household undernutrition is defined as when a household has an undernourished child or an underweight woman. And household overnutrition occurs when the household has an overweight child or an overweight woman. Meanwhile, anaemic households are households with either an anaemic child or an anaemic woman of reproductive age. Households with the co-existence of household undernutrition, overnutrition and anaemia are then defined as households with TBM [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For instance, a household is said to have TBM if an overweight woman and an anaemic child who is stunted are in the same household. Likewise, an overweight child and a woman who is underweight and anaemic in the same household could also be classified as a household with TBM.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Independent variables</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Child-level variables.</title><p>These included child&#8217;s sex, child age in months, child&#8217;s estimated birth size as recalled by women (described as large, average or small), child&#8217;s birth order and child&#8217;s breastfeeding status grouped as still breastfeeding, ever breastfed or never breastfed. Child&#8217;s dietary diversity was also included, in which dietary diversity was measured to reflect the quality of food intake using the 24-hour dietary recall method. For Ghana DHS 2003, 2008 and 2014 datasets, the seven-food group WHO indicator was used as a measure of dietary diversity [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; 1) grains, starchy roots, tubers and plantains 2) beans, nuts and seeds 3) dairy products 4) meat, fish and poultry 5) eggs 6) vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables 7) other fruits and vegetables.

Chicago, IL, USA). First, the relevant variables in each of the four datasets were merged into one combined dataset such that each variable is a continuation of itself from 2003 to 2022. This was done manually by copying each relevant variable from all datasets into the combined dataset. In the combined dataset, all variables in each year&#8217;s dataset were designated as such by the year of data collection. Descriptive statistics were then used to summarize the participant&#8217;s background characteristics, where categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables as mean and standard errors. The trend of all forms of malnutrition including the TBM were presented as frequencies and percentages in their corresponding years of data collection. The pooled prevalence of each type of malnutrition was calculated by summing up the estimates from all four points of data collection. Bivariate binary logistic regression analyses were used to determine the unadjusted odds of all the malnutrition indicators in 2022, 2014 and 2008 relative to 2003. Additional bivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted between the main dependent variable and the independent variables to identify the significant variables for inclusion in the multivariable model. Child-level, maternal-level and household-level factors that were significant with p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 in the bivariate analyses were included in the multivariable logistic regressions all at once. The model was assessed for multicollinearity using a correlation matrix. Our analyses accounted for the multistage cluster design of the DHS by adjusting for clustering and stratification using the SPSS Complex Samples module. This procedure involved creating complex sample plan file (csplan) based on cluster, strata and sample weight variables in the combined dataset. The csplan file was used as the basis for all analyses in this study. The purpose was to normalize variance and mitigate the risk of bias in under and over sampled subpopulations. All analyses were conducted with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI), with statistical significance set at p-value&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 for the bivariate and multivariable analyses. The chi-square value and overall model p-value of the Wald test were used to assess model significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec014"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Background characteristics</title><p><xref rid="pgph.0005078.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows 11,925 mother-child pairs in the same household from 2003, 2008, 2014 and 2022 Ghana DHS datasets.

Anaemia among children also reduced from 72.0% (70.0 - 74.0) in 2003 to 46.2% (43.9 - 48.6) in 2022 with a pooled prevalence of 61.7% (60.7 - 71.7). Similar downward trends can be observed for child wasting, underweight and overweight with pooled prevalences of 6.8% (6.3 - 7.3), 13.1% (12.1 - 12.1) and 3.4% (2.9 - 4.9), respectively. For mothers, a reduction is observed in underweight, i.e., from 8.4% (7.1 - 9.8) in 2003 to 5.0% (4.1 - 6.0) in 2022 with a pooled prevalence of 6.8% (5.8 - 5.8).

However, mothers overweight almost doubled from 25.1% (22.7 - 27.6) in 2003 to 45.0% (42.2 - 47.8) in 2022.

While childhood undernutrition (i.e., stunting, wasting, underweight, overweight) and anaemia (i.e., child and maternal) declined over time, maternal overweight increased significantly. The pooled TBM prevalence was 6.7%, showing an overall decline from 7.6% in 2003 to 5.0% in 2022. Consistent with a previous study among SSA countries [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], factors such as child sex, birth size, breastfeeding, maternal education, dietary diversity, wealth, and urbanicity were significantly associated with TBM in the present study.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study to analyse the trends and factors associated with the pooled estimate of the TBM in Ghana. As such direct country-specific literature comparisons may not be feasible. Nonetheless, the pooled TBM estimate of 6.7% in this study aligns with the reported TBM prevalence in Ghana as reported in a multinational study that analysed 23 SSA countries between 2008 and 2017 [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly, this finding is consistent with a study conducted in Nepal, where TBM prevalence was 7.0% [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the TBM prevalence in the present study is lower than that reported in a multi-national study among some LMICs including Indonesia [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], but higher than findings from India, and other African countries such as Malawi and Ethiopia [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Such contrasts in prevalence could be due to differences in maternal obesity rates. For instance, UNICEF describes Indonesia as having severe TBM owing to the rapid increases in maternal obesity rates which is estimated to be about 45% [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In contrast, overweight and obesity rates in India and Malawi are lower at 25% and 19%, respectively [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>TBM has been on a downward trend in Ghana from 7.6% in 2003 to 4.8% in 2014 and remained steady at 5.0% in 2022. In further analysis, TBM had a significantly lower likelihood of occurring in 2022 as compared to 2003. This inconsistency could be an indication of a lack of holistic progress in the reduction of all forms of malnutrition. The reductions in undernutrition and increases in maternal and household overweight have been consistent over the past two decades and this is comparable with the findings of the WHO global report on malnutrition among LMICs [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The specific reasons for the increasing maternal overweight/obesity in Ghana could be varied. First, it is characteristic of a country undergoing economic and nutrition transition to experience some increases in overnutrition rates akin to postulations by Popkin et al. (2012) [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This is mainly attributable to the occurrence of an overcorrection due to the prolonged exposure to chronic undernutrition. This tendency to overcompensate under these circumstances is also advanced by Matrins et al., 2011 [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], who reported that malnourished children are more likely to suffer overweight and overweight-related non-communicable diseases later in life due to early-life undernutrition. The second reason for the increasing maternal overweight may be an outcome of socio-cultural perceptions or misconceptions. In most parts of the developing world including Ghana, weight gain, particularly among women, is perceived as prestigious, and sometimes associated with affluence [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. To this effect, women who gain weight are thought to be living a good life and a not-so-good life if they lose weight, irrespective of the reason for the weight loss.</p><p>Meanwhile, the reason(s) for the general decline in undernutrition, and anaemia rates in Ghana may be ascribed to, first, the building of the human resource capacity of practitioners and service providers. And second, the deliberate and concerted efforts at reducing malnutrition rates through direct programming and nutrition interventions by relevant stakeholders. The promotion of optimal infant and young child feeding practices; including exclusive breastfeeding for infants less than 6 months, timely and appropriate complementary feeding for children and lactation support mothers, are examples of such interventions [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Other interventions include Iron and folic acid supplementation aimed at reducing anaemia among pregnant and lactating women; the growth monitoring and promotion meant at tracking child growth and providing nutrition support when needed; the high dose vitamin A supplementation for women and children; the flour and vegetable oil fortification for general populace to increase micronutrient intake; the nutritional support for vulnerable groups such HIV and TB clients; and the Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] among others. The CMAM for instance, provides as a comprehensive undernutrition management strategy that starts from case tracing at the community level through to in-patient care at Government hospitals. These interventions have been running for a significant part of the past two decades with some being in existence for well over 3 decades [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Their co-ordination and implementation are governed by the Ghana Nutrition Policy, and the Ghana Public Health Act 2012 [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It should however be noted that despite the general reductions in undernutrition indicators, their current prevalence remains above internationally acceptable &#8216;low thresholds&#8217; for stunting, wasting, underweight and anaemia which are currently pegged at 10%, 5%, 7.5% and 20%, respectively [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>At the household, maternal and child levels, this study found several factors that were associated with the pooled TBM among mother-child pairs in Ghana. One such factor is infant breastfeeding. This study revealed that breastfeeding reduced the likelihood of experiencing TBM similar to a study by Chilot et al., 2023 [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Breast milk is comprised of the requisite nutrients and relevant immune factors that not only prevent micronutrient deficiencies but also help protect against infections that exacerbate undernutrition outcomes [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As a result, breastfed infants are less likely to be stunted, wasted or suffer micronutrient deficiencies, particularly in low-income conditions [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It has been established that breastfeeding also provides some protection against childhood obesity, because breastfed children are less likely to consume excessive calories [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Consistent with previous studies male children and children with low birth sizes had a higher likelihood of experiencing TBM [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The higher nutrient requirements of male children relative to their female counterparts make male children more susceptible to undernutrition-related challenges [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Also, a disadvantaged early start occasioned by poor nutrient reserves associated with low-birth-size children could mean such children are more vulnerable to micronutrient deficiencies, undernutrition and later life obesity &#8211; the components of TBM.</p><p>Nutrition education that promotes the consumption of diversified food is a better positive predictor of nutritional status than food quantity. Yet most nutrition interventions, particularly in low-resourced regions, still focus on providing enough calories rather than meeting micronutrient requirements [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. It is therefore not surprising, given the undernutrition rates, that women with no education and inadequate dietary diversity were independently more likely to suffer TBM. The observed associations could be attributed to the concept espoused by some studies that higher educational levels more often translates into greater nutritional knowledge, that may contribute to healthier food choices and better nutrition outcomes for both mother and child [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>The other associated factors include wealth and urbanicity where high wealth households and rural households were less likely to suffer TBM. This instance brings to the fore the notion that the urban poor may be disproportionately affected by TBM in the wake of nutrition transition and urbanization. A notion that is promulgated by Popkin et al. In their seminal work on the global nutrition transition [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], they argue that urbanization is directly linked to dietary transition where locally available traditional diets rich in fibres, whole grains and green vegetables are replaced with highly processed diets when the rural dwellers move to urban cities. This shift, which occurs predominantly among urban poor, exposes the urban poor to high-calorie diets and also deprives them of adequate micronutrients. Their exposure to cheap, processed, salt-laden, added-sugar, and high-fat foods in urban areas is further exacerbated by aggressive marketing campaigns, mass media and the lack of a proper regulatory framework [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; making these diets more desirable and economically accessible to many low-income earners. Suffice it to say that wealth could have protective tendencies against malnutrition, in that it may facilitate access to diverse diets, and also enhance access to healthcare, and education [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, increasing obesity rates among wealthier populations in some countries suggest that while high wealth may reduce undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies, it may not fully shield against the risks of overweight and obesity due to the aforementioned nutrition-transition-related factors.</p><sec id="sec021"><title>Public health implications</title><p>This study not only bridges the literature gap on the TBM in Ghana but also has significant implications for practice and policy. For instance, given that exclusive breastfeeding in Ghana is on a marginal decline, measures targeting breastfeeding practices needs strengthening [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Such measures could include the increase in maternity leave to six months so mothers can have the full benefit of the entire six months to breastfeed. Another strategy could be the re-introduction of the mother-to-mother support groups at the community level, where older women would guide and encourage younger mothers on the benefits of breastfeeding. This is particularly relevant as a study in Northern Ghana, found that older multiparous mothers were more likely to breastfeed as compared to younger mothers [<xref rid="pgph.0005078.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. If Ghana is to achieve the sustainable development goal 2.2 by ending all forms of malnutrition, then stakeholders should put in measures to stem the tide of rural-urban migration by providing the requisite amenities at the rural level. It should, among other livelihood empowerment programs, strengthen the Ghana livelihood empowerment against poverty program that seeks to support economically disadvantaged households with cash handouts. Relevant stakeholders across multiple sectors should also create an environment that ensures equal opportunity for all in order to enhance equitable wealth distribution. Maternal education using behaviour change communication on the need for diversified food intake should also be re-iterated at the antenatal care level as this has the tendency to improve maternal nutrition and neonatal outcomes. Also, interventions with integrated programs targeting shared drivers (e.g., food quality, inequity) may be more effective than siloed approaches addressing undernutrition, obesity, or micronutrient deficits separately. Finally, there is the need to consider repurposing existing nutrition interventions. This would ensure that supplement-based or food-based programs do not inadvertently increase maternal or child overweight or obesity.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Limitations</title><p>The Ghana DHS datasets are comprised of variables that are measured using cross-sectional methods, as such this study is limited to descriptions of observed associations and not causal inferences. Some variables such as birth size and food consumed over the past 24 hrs, were subjectively measured using mothers&#8217; recall and as such could be subject to recall bias. However, given the very large sample size, the effects of these biases could be insignificant as it is expected that they would be uniformly distributed among both sides of the main dependent variable. Also, the use of pooled estimates from two decades of DHS datasets means that our findings can even out year-to-year fluctuations caused by transient factors such as pandemics, providing medium-to-long-term findings that are important for policy formation and intervention implementation. The DHS is a nationally representative dataset; hence our findings are generalizable to all mother-child-pairs in Ghana.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides important insights into the trends and determinants of TBM in Ghana, highlighting both progress and persistent challenges. The findings indicate that despite the significant reductions in undernutrition and anaemia indicators, the TBM rate in Ghana has stagnated with very marginal reductions over the past two decades. This is largely driven by the consistent increases in maternal overweight and obesity rates. Breastfeeding, being a male child, large birth size, maternal education, dietary diversity, household wealth and urbanicity are the factors associated with the TBM. Accordingly, putting in place mechanisms to promote breastfeeding, improve diversified food intake, ensure equitable distribution of resources with emphasis of rural empowerment would help provide a unifying solution to the TBM challenge. Until such a time these systemic changes are made, health education that uses behaviour change communication targeting women can achieve a great deal.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would

There is no overnutrition in this scenario, so it qualifies as a double burden.</p><p>Line 206: &#8220;maternal education, religion, ethnicity&#8221;</p><p>Categories need to be mentioned, as done with the other variables.</p><p>Line 210: &#8220;This was calculated based on 24 hr-food consumption patterns from the FAO &amp; FHI 10-food group classifications [35]; 1) grains, white roots and tubers, and plantains, 2) beans, peas and lentils, 3) nuts and seeds 4) milk and milk products 5) meat, poultry and fish, 6) eggs, 7) dark green leafy vegetables 8) other vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables, 9) other vegetables and 10) other fruits.&#8221;</p><p>For standardization purposes, since the different food groups were mentioned for women&#8217;s diet diversity score, the same needs to be done for the child&#8217;s different food groups earlier.</p><p>Line 281: &#8220;74.7% of children aged &lt; 24 months were still breastfeeding,&#8221;</p><p>Why wasn&#8217;t exclusively breast fed further considered? Given the WHO recommendations and the critical role it plays in malnutrition.</p><p>Line 307: &#8220;Mothers overweight had a pooled prevalence of 35.2% (34.2 - 26.2).&#8221;</p><p>For standardization purposes, why hasn&#8217;t the trend for overweight mentioned as well? (up from x)</p><p>Line 407: &#8220;Where malnourished children are more likely to suffer overweight and overweight-related non-communicable diseases later in life due to early-life undernutrition&#8221;</p><p>This is not a sentence, it needs revision.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;The manuscript tackles a relevant topic but lacks novelty in its main claims. Several assertions are made without proper citation, and the literature review is thin, failing to place the study adequately within existing research. The analysis is shallow, with limited interpretation of regression results and no control for key confounding variables. Lastly, the discussion includes claims that are not fully grounded in the presented data. A major revision is needed to address issues of depth, referencing, and transparency.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;I congratulates all who participated in preparing the manuscript. To me the manuscript is well thought, written and it provide new experience and insight in reviewing data sets of the long existing data sets of DHS programs not only in Ghana, but also it may attract more researchers and academia in different countries to look into their existing data. You have shown a way to others</p><p>Reviewer #4:&#160;The article was were written and cogent . However , the article will benefit from some areas that were not explored i,e interrelationship between the different types of malnutrition , analysis of TBM as outcome of complex issues . The statistical analysis section will benefit if authors could explain choice of how variables were use ( form of utilization ) and the exact choice of models used .</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
