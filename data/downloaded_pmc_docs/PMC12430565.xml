Introduction</title><p>Mayonnaise is an oil-in-water emulsion typically containing 70&#8211;80% oil, stabilized by egg yolk. Conventional formulations are high in cholesterol and saturated fats, and the use of raw eggs poses a <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> contamination risk. Egg allergy is one of the most prevalent food allergies in children, typically developing in infancy and early childhood. It is triggered by proteins such as ovalbumin and ovomucoid in egg white, which can cause reactions ranging from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis [<xref rid="B1-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These health and safety concerns have driven interest in plant-based alternatives that maintain desirable texture, flavor, and stability while reducing fat and eliminating animal-derived ingredients. The global rise in veganism and flexitarian diets has fueled interest in egg-free mayonnaise, as consumers increasingly seek sustainable, cholesterol-free, and allergen-friendly products. Aquafaba, the viscous liquid from cooking chickpeas, exhibits emulsifying, foaming, and thickening properties [<xref rid="B5-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It contains 92&#8211;95% water and 5&#8211;8% dry matter, including low-molecular-weight proteins, saponins, and carbohydrates [<xref rid="B7-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has been successfully applied as an egg replacer in bakery, confectionery, and emulsion-based products [<xref rid="B9-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Gum tragacanth, a polysaccharide exudate from <italic toggle="yes">Astragalus</italic> spp., is a non-toxic, biodegradable, and pH-stable thickener and emulsifier [<xref rid="B10-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Its high viscosity and ability to stabilize emulsions make it a promising candidate for improving texture and storage stability in plant-based mayonnaise.</p><p>Recent studies have investigated other plant-based stabilizers, such as pea protein&#8211;xanthan gum conjugates [<xref rid="B14-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], yellow mustard gum [<xref rid="B15-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and chia mucilage&#8211;gum arabic blends [<xref rid="B16-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], demonstrating good stability and consumer acceptance. However, research on aquafaba&#8211;gum tragacanth combinations is limited. The Scientific Committee for Food of the European Community has approved gum tragacanth as an additive with the E413 E-number in Europe. GT has a moisture content of 8.79&#8211;12.94 g/100 g for different species and produces more viscous solutions when added to water [<xref rid="B17-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The protein content of GT varies based on species; for example, <italic toggle="yes">A. compactus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">A. microcephalus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">A. fluccosus</italic> may contain 1.65&#8211;2.59% protein. Moreover, the carbohydrate content may vary between 83.81% and 86.52% for different species. Furthermore, GT species have variations in the mineral content, such as potassium and calcium, which are the major inorganic elements for species. Tragacanthic acid and tragacanthin are the two soluble fractions of GT, and they dissolve and yield the production of viscous colloidal hydrosols when dispersed in water, whereas bassorin (60&#8211;70%) is developed as an insoluble gel fraction [<xref rid="B18-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. One of the notable advantages of GT is its remarkable stability over a wide range of temperatures and pH levels. This characteristic ensures that the texture and consistency of plant-based mayonnaise remain stable during processing and storage. To stabilize the emulsion, it reduces the collision and droplet attachment by decreasing the movement and release of dispersed droplets in the emulsion.</p><p>Considerable research has been devoted to developing low-fat mayonnaise using various ingredients, primarily to reduce the negative health impacts associated with high oil content. GT was added at lower concentrations to facilitate the production of healthier mayonnaise formulations. Pedramnia, Elhamirad and Habashi [<xref rid="B1-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] prepared mayonnaise with whey protein concentrates as an egg substitute and gum tragacanth as a fat substitute. The textural properties of mayonnaise improved with increased firmness and consistency, resulting in better adhesiveness and smaller oil droplet diameters. With the addition of gum tragacanth, a complex and strong gel-like structure was formed in the continuous phase of mayonnaise. However, GT exhibits limited solubility in cold water and requires prolonged hydration times to achieve full functionality. Shen, et al. [<xref rid="B19-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] studied the emulsifying properties of pea protein conjugated with guar gum (G-PPI) as a functional emulsifier in mayonnaise. Compared to unmodified pea protein, G-PPI emulsions exhibited higher stability (89.4%), smaller droplet size (934.4 nm), and greater viscosity (48.62 mPa&#183;s) [<xref rid="B19-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Odep, et al. [<xref rid="B20-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] investigated the use of gum arabic (GA) combined with chia mucilage as egg and fat replacers in fat-reduced mayonnaise formulations. Mayonnaise samples with chia mucilage (15&#8211;60%) and 3% GA showed significantly lower calories, reduced fat, and increased moisture than the controls [<xref rid="B20-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Hashemi, et al. [<xref rid="B21-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] studied the conjugation of lysozyme (Lyz) with gum arabic (GA) to enhance its emulsifying and antibacterial properties in mayonnaise. The Lyz-GA conjugate exhibited improved antibacterial activity against <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> and enhanced emulsification stability and rheological properties, including elasticity and shear-thinning behavior. Sensory evaluation confirmed that the mayonnaise with the conjugate matched commercial standards, demonstrating its potential as a natural preservative and emulsifier in food products [<xref rid="B21-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Liu, et al. [<xref rid="B22-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] explored yellow mustard gum (YMG) as an emulsifier in vegan mayonnaise (VM) formulations at 0&#8211;1.0% concentrations. YMG significantly improved emulsion stability, rheology, droplet size, texture, and shelf-life compared to commercial products, making it a promising candidate for plant-based and clean-label applications [<xref rid="B22-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recent work has explored aquafaba as an egg replacer in vegan mayonnaise due to its foaming and emulsifying properties. For example, a recent study demonstrated that chickpea aquafaba can produce mayonnaise with good rheological stability and acceptable sensory properties [<xref rid="B23-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Replacing egg yolk with aquafaba and stabilizing the emulsion with gum tragacanth would yield a plant-based mayonnaise with physicochemical stability, antioxidant potential, and sensory acceptability comparable to or exceeding those of conventional egg-based mayonnaise. Most previous studies have focused either on aquafaba or on alternative gums in isolation, without systematically examining their combined functionality. The present study differs by incorporating both aquafaba and gum tragacanth (GT) in defined ratios to optimize emulsion stability and nutritional quality. In addition to proximate composition and storage stability, this study also evaluates antioxidant activity, rheological behavior, and sensory acceptability, providing a broader functional assessment than earlier work. Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop plant-based mayonnaise formulations using aquafaba as an egg replacer and gum tragacanth as a natural stabilizer, and to evaluate their physicochemical, antioxidant, rheological, microbiological, and sensory characteristics during refrigerated storage. By integrating both functional ingredients, this study seeks to provide new insights into sustainable, allergen-free, and health-oriented condiment formulations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-30-03511"><title>2.

Antioxidant capacity declined over time, with the lowest values in treatment T<sub>0</sub> on day 28 (8.65 &#177; 1.29M, phosphomolybdate; 7.69 &#177; 1.29O, DPPH). Plant extracts exerted a protective role in the oxidative stability of mayonnaise emulsions. The rancidity resistance was observed to be 33% and 58% with an increase in storage days. Incorporation of natural antioxidants improved the lipid oxidation resistance of fat emulsions. S&#248;rensen, et al. [<xref rid="B25-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported that incorporation of catechol with gum inhibited the oxidation rate. DPPH was used to determine the antioxidant capacity of the plant extracts [<xref rid="B25-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. <xref rid="molecules-30-03511-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows that antioxidant activity, measured by phosphomolybdate and DPPH assays, was consistently higher in aquafaba&#8211;gum formulations, particularly T<sub>3</sub>, compared with the control, demonstrating the functional contribution of aquafaba and gum tragacanth.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-molecules-30-03511"><title>2.3. Physicochemical Analysis of Plant-Based Mayonnaise</title><p>The moisture, fat, fiber, and nitrogen-free extract content of plant-based mayonnaise samples decreased as aquafaba and gum tragacanth concentrations increased, whereas protein and ash contents showed the opposite trend. Protein rose significantly from 12.82 &#177; 2.15% in the control (T<sub>0</sub>) to 19.13 &#177; 1.95% in T<sub>3</sub> (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), reflecting the contribution of aquafaba solids, which are rich in low-molecular-weight proteins and saponins. Similarly, ash content increased by 28% in T<sub>3</sub> compared to T<sub>0</sub>, attributable to the mineral fraction of gum tragacanth, which contains potassium and calcium salts. The reduction in fat content across T<sub>1</sub>&#8211;T<sub>3</sub> is explained by the partial substitution of the oil phase with aquafaba and gum solutions, which dilute lipid concentration and replace fat droplets with biopolymer matrices. Moisture decline during storage (0&#8211;28 day) is consistent with evaporation and water redistribution within the emulsion, leading to tighter microstructural binding of water by polysaccharides. These mechanisms align with previous findings where plant-based ingredients altered proximate composition by binding water and displacing oil. Evanuarini and Susilo [<xref rid="B26-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] conducted a similar study in which flour of banana peel decreased the moisture content of plant-based mayonnaise. The control T<sub>0</sub> treatment contained maximum moisture owing to the presence of 70% oil and no addition of banana flour. Banana peel flour has been shown to enhance the thickness of plant-based mayonnaise [<xref rid="B26-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Mustafa, He, Shim and Reaney [<xref rid="B5-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported similar results by determining the fiber, ash content and nitrogen-free extracts [<xref rid="B5-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Ma and Boye [<xref rid="B27-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] conducted a similar study in which protein and fat content was determined in an emulsified product. The results showed an increase in protein content and a decrease in fat content in plant-based mayonnaise due to the addition of chickpea protein [<xref rid="B27-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similarly, the protein content increased in T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub> due to the addition of aquafaba, a protein source from the pulse family. Fat content can be decreased by substituting fat droplets with numerous biopolymers, such as gums. In this study, the fat content decreased in T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub> due to the addition of canola and soybean oils. <xref rid="molecules-30-03511-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the effect of aquafaba and gum tragacanth on proximate composition during 28 days of storage. Compared to the control (T<sub>0</sub>), the T<sub>3</sub> formulation retained higher protein and ash contents while showing reduced fat and moisture, reflecting the nutritional impact of aquafaba&#8211;gum enrichment.</p><p>The initial pH values of the control sample (T<sub>0</sub>) and the other formulated treatments (T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub>) were different (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The highest overall pH was recorded in the control sample (T<sub>0</sub>) at 0 d of storage (4.3 &#177; 0.13), whereas the lowest pH was noted for T<sub>3</sub> (containing 25% aquafaba extract and 100% gum tragacanth) at 28 d of storage (3.33 &#177; 0.10). The decreasing trend in pH values over time indicates a gradual increase in acidity during refrigerated storage. Gum has a slightly acidic pH value. The acidity of the gum caused a reduction in the pH of the plant-based mayonnaise samples. With an increase in storage time, the acidity increases, which controls microbial growth. Therefore, gum can decrease microbial activity due to the increased acidity. In interaction, highest acidity was obtained for treatment T<sub>3</sub> at 28th day of storage (2.3 &#177; 0.28 <sup>a</sup>), whereas the lowest acidity was obtained for treatment T<sub>0</sub> at 0 storage days (0.61 &#177; 0.12 <sup>l</sup>). Mayonnaise had a high acidity value owing to the presence of gum at different concentrations. The high acidity was constant with pH value, which induced a reduction in the pH of the emulsion with an increase in the acidity. Ali and El Said [<xref rid="B28-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] developed plant-based mayonnaise with the addition of gum arabic and results confirmed that GA is a complex polysaccharide, branched-chain, slightly acidic. Gum arabic was found to be a mixture of polysaccharides with potassium, magnesium, and calcium salts. They reported similar results, in which the samples showed an increase in acidity. The highest peroxide value was obtained for treatment T<sub>0</sub> on the 28th day of storage (14.38 &#177; 0.84 <sup>a</sup>), whereas the lowest peroxide value was obtained for treatment T<sub>3</sub> on day 0 of storage (6.03 &#177; 0.84 <sup>l</sup>). Orgulloso-Bautista, et al. [<xref rid="B29-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] prepared plant-based mayonnaise with basil leaves which was less than 10 meq/kg at the end of storage day. The PV values for all mayonnaise samples exceeded the safety limit at the end of the storage period, while the plant-based mayonnaise sample reached only 6.88 meq/kg, indicating the prevention of oil oxidation. Egg was replaced with gum arabic, which resulted in the prevention of oil oxidation at 5 &#176;C during the storage period. <xref rid="molecules-30-03511-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows that pH gradually decreased, while acidity and peroxide values increased during storage. These changes were more pronounced in aquafaba&#8211;gum formulations than in the control, reflecting the impact of plant-based stabilizers on oxidative stability.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-molecules-30-03511"><title>2.4. Stability in Plant-Based Mayonnaise</title><p>The highest creaming index was obtained for T<sub>0</sub> at 28th day of storage (1.23 &#177; 0.03 <sup>a</sup>), whereas the lowest creaming index was obtained for T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub> at 0 d storage. The increase in creaming during storage reflects gravitational separation caused by droplet flocculation and water redistribution. In contrast, aquafaba&#8211;gum tragacanth formulations showed markedly lower creaming rates, particularly T<sub>3</sub>, due to the combined effects of polysaccharide-induced viscosity enhancement and protein&#8211;polysaccharide interfacial interactions. Gum tragacanth forms a three-dimensional hydrocolloid matrix that slows droplet mobility, while aquafaba proteins adsorb at the oil&#8211;water interface, forming a viscoelastic film that resists droplet coalescence. Together, these mechanisms reduce creaming by stabilizing dispersed droplets against gravitational separation. McClements and J. [<xref rid="B30-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reported that the incorporation of gum arabic into mayonnaise had a defending impact on emulsion separation into two layers compared to the control after 30 days at 5 &#176;C storage temperature.

Ali and El Said [<xref rid="B28-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported that gum arabic exhibited great potential as an emulsifier till the end of storage. The plant-based mayonnaise exhibited maximum stability of 90.65%. Creaming stability in mayonnaise containing gum tragacanth (87.8&#8211;88.5%) remained comparable to the control (88.2%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &gt; 0.05), indicating that gum tragacanth effectively stabilized the emulsion to the same extent as egg yolk [<xref rid="B28-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

The mold count value increased regularly during storage in 25% of gum arabic samples. Mayonnaise samples exhibited no microbial growth in 50, 75, and 100% GA [<xref rid="B31-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Viscosity</title><p>The viscosity of the mayonnaise samples was evaluated on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28. The maximum overall viscosity was observed for treatment T<sub>3</sub> among various treatments, whereas during the storage period, the maximum overall viscosity was observed on 0 storage day. The viscosity generally decreased over time, indicating a reduced thickness during storage. Viscosity rose from 8.44 &#177; 6.96 Pa&#183;s in samples containing 0.3% gum tragacanth to 16.64 &#177; 2.57 Pa&#183;s at 1.0% gum concentration (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), showing that gum concentration enhanced emulsion thickness. However, viscosity declined steadily over storage, dropping to 9.3 Pa&#183;s after 28 days, indicating gradual thinning of the emulsion due to droplet coalescence. Although gum tragacanth demonstrated good stabilizing capacity in plant-based mayonnaise, its limited solubility in cold water requires prolonged hydration (often several hours) to achieve full functional performance. This property, while acceptable in laboratory-scale trials, may present challenges for industrial application, where rapid processing is preferred. Future studies should therefore examine hydration optimization strategies, such as pre-soaking, controlled temperature treatments, or alternative hydrocolloids, to improve process efficiency without compromising product quality.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-molecules-30-03511"><title>2.7. Textural Analysis</title><p>The firmness of the mayonnaise samples improved with the incorporation of gum tragacanth, which significantly influenced their textural properties. Treatment T<sub>3</sub> showed the highest overall firmness (114.95 &#177; 3.08 <sup>a</sup>), with a peak value on day 0 (118.88 &#177; 1.29 <sup>a</sup>). The lowest firmness was recorded for T<sub>0</sub> on day 28 (96.79 &#177; 1.29 <sup>h</sup>). These findings align with Pedramnia, Elhamirad and Habashi [<xref rid="B1-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], who reported the maximum and minimum adhesiveness, consistency, and firmness of mayonnaise samples, respectively. Regression measurements of textural firmness, adhesiveness, and cohesiveness showed that the examined samples suited the model well, with determination coefficients of 98.72, 99.96, and 99.78, respectively.

Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Analysis of Mayonnaise Samples</title><p>FTIR spectra of control mayonnaise (T<sub>0</sub>) and plant-based formulations (T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub>) are presented. Across all samples, characteristic peaks were observed that correspond to major functional groups present in proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides. A strong absorption band at 3440 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> was assigned to O&#8211;H stretching vibrations of phenols and hydroxyl groups, indicating the presence of antioxidant compounds. The band at 1743 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> corresponded to ester C=O stretching, typically associated with lipids and emulsifying molecules, while a distinct absorption at 1630 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> reflected carboxylic acid groups and amide I stretching in proteins. Additional peaks at 1429, 1516, and 1612 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> were attributed to aromatic C=C, C=O, and C&#8211;C stretching, respectively, while bending vibrations of phenolic O&#8211;H groups were evident at 1359 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Differences among treatments were evident in peak intensities. The control sample (T<sub>0</sub>) exhibited lower absorbance at phenolic O&#8211;H (3440 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and carboxylic acid (1630 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) regions compared to T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>, reflecting the higher content of aquafaba-derived phenolic compounds in plant-based formulations. Similarly, ester-related bands (1743 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) were more pronounced in T<sub>3</sub>, suggesting enhanced lipid&#8211;gum interactions contributing to emulsion stability. The spectra of T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> displayed intermediate values, consistent with their lower aquafaba and gum concentrations. These findings indicate that aquafaba and gum tragacanth contribute additional functional compounds such as phenolics, esters, and carboxylic acids that are absent or less prominent in egg-based mayonnaise. Their presence likely enhanced antioxidant activity and emulsion stability in plant-based samples, supporting the functional role of these ingredients in mayonnaise formulation. Thus, FTIR provides molecular-level confirmation that aquafaba&#8211;gum systems not only act as egg replacers but also enrich the product with bioactive components that improve quality and stability. The FTIR peak values in this study closely matched those reported by Khalid, et al.

Sensory Evaluation of Plant-Based Mayonnaise</title><p>Sensory evaluation of plant-based mayonnaise samples was conducted based on color, taste, odor, texture, and overall acceptability across 0 to 28 days of storage. For all parameters, the best scores were observed on day 0, with a gradual decline over time. Among the treatments, T<sub>3</sub> consistently received the highest scores for all sensory attributes. Specifically, T<sub>3</sub> recorded the top values for color (6.74 &#177; 1.56 <sup>a</sup>), taste (6.69 &#177; 1.54 <sup>a</sup>), odor (6.74 &#177; 1.43 <sup>a</sup>), texture (6.68 &#177; 1.48 <sup>a</sup>), and overall acceptability (6.64 &#177; 1.47 <sup>a</sup>). The highest individual scores were observed on day 0, such as for texture (8.73 &#177; 0.81 <sup>a</sup>) and overall acceptability (8.64 &#177; 0.76 <sup>a</sup>), whereas the lowest scores were recorded on day 28 for various treatments (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The reduction in overall acceptability shows that consumer preference declined with storage time, likely due to textural and flavor changes. He, et al. [<xref rid="B33-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] reported similar results for the color, odor, taste, texture, and overall acceptability of low-fat mayonnaise [<xref rid="B33-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Due to GA&#8217;s high antioxidant activity, the oxidative stability of plant-based mayonnaise remained unchanged at the end of the storage period, which implies acceptable quality and safety for consumption [<xref rid="B28-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. During storage, the gradual increase in peroxide value reflected the onset of lipid oxidation, a process commonly associated with the development of rancid or off-odors in emulsified products. This explains the decline in odor acceptability scores observed in later storage days, as oxidation by-products can negatively influence sensory perception. As shown in <xref rid="molecules-30-03511-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>, sensory scores for appearance, taste, texture, and overall acceptability declined during storage in all treatments.

Future studies should be conducted on direct comparison with commercially available egg-free mayonnaise products, which would allow benchmarking of physicochemical and sensory performance. Moreover, modeled nutritional labeling or caloric analysis should also be conducted. Future studies can include instrumental volatile profiling (e.g., GC&#8211;MS) alongside sensory evaluation to better elucidate the relationship between lipid oxidation, volatile release, and odor acceptability in aquafaba-based mayonnaise.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-molecules-30-03511"><title>3.

The control was prepared by mixing the egg yolk, sugar, salt, and vinegar for 2 min, followed by the gradual addition of oil dropwise while blending with a high-speed blender (WestPoint<sup>&#174;</sup> Professional Hand Blender, 220&#8211;240 V, 50&#8211;60 Hz, 600 Watts, WF-9714, Sargodha, Pakistan) for 5&#8211;6 min. Three samples of plant-based mayonnaise were prepared according to the method described by Raikos, et al. [<xref rid="B34-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], with several modifications. In plant-based formulations, egg yolk was replaced with aquafaba, and gum tragacanth was incorporated at varying concentrations for emulsion stabilization. The plant-based mayonnaise formulations comprised canola oil, aquafaba, vinegar, sugar, salt, and gum tragacanth based on weight percentages. The formulation (%) of the control and plant-based mayonnaise is given in <xref rid="molecules-30-03511-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Canola oil was chosen as the oil phase because of their widespread availability, neutral flavor profile, and frequent use in commercial mayonnaise formulations. It also provides a balanced fatty acid composition, making them suitable for developing plant-based emulsions. Other oils (e.g., olive, sunflower) were not included to avoid introducing strong flavors or compositional variability that could confound the effects of aquafaba and gum tragacanth. Thus, the primary controlled variables were oil type, processing conditions, and storage environment, while the manipulated variables were the aquafaba-to-oil ratio and gum tragacanth concentration. For plant-based samples, aquafaba was first mixed with sugar, salt, and vinegar for 2 min, followed by the gradual addition of oil under continuous high-speed blending for 3 min, forming a foamy and creamy emulsion. Each mayonnaise batch (300 g) was aliquoted into polyethylene bags, sealed, and stored at 4 &#176;C for 28 days. Physicochemical properties, storage stability, and textural characteristics were evaluated at weekly intervals and compared with those of the control. At each storage day, three aliquots were taken from the same batch and analyzed in triplicate. Thus, replication in this study represents repeated measurements (technical replicates) from one biological batch per treatment. This design is standard for storage stability experiments, as it ensures that observed changes reflect the effect of storage rather than batch-to-batch variation.

Physicochemical Analysis</title><p>The physicochemical parameters of plant-based mayonnaise, such as moisture, fat, ash, crude fiber, crude protein, and carbohydrate content (nitrogen-free extract, NFE), were determined following standard methods described by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists [<xref rid="B37-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The moisture content in the plant-based mayonnaise treatments was analyzed using a hot air oven (Model: ED-115) Binder, Germany. Physicochemical analysis of plant-based mayonnaise was performed using standard methods (AOAC Method No. 930.15), ash (AOAC Method No. 942.05), and acidity (AOAC Method No. 947.05). Crude protein content was determined using the Kjeldahl method. Briefly, approximately 1 g of mayonnaise sample was digested with 20 mL of concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 5 g of digestion mixture (K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> 90%, CuSO<sub>4</sub> 7%, FeSO<sub>4</sub> 3%) at 400 &#176;C until a clear light green solution was obtained. The digested sample was diluted and distilled with 40% NaOH in a Kjeldahl apparatus, and the released ammonia was trapped in 2% boric acid containing a methyl red indicator. Titration was performed using 0.05 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> until a golden-brown endpoint was reached. The fat content of plant-based mayonnaise was evaluated using the Gerber method with some modifications, as described by Marshall [<xref rid="B38-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The Gerber method is a volumetric method that employs chemical reagents, such as sulfuric acid, to break down the emulsion and separate the fat. A special flask, known as a butyrometer, was used to measure the fat content. Ten milliliters of mayonnaise were transferred to a butyrometer, followed by the addition of 10 mL concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 3&#8211;4 mL isoamyl alcohol. The mixture was carefully inverted for complete mixing and placed in a water bath at 65 &#176;C for 30 min. After heating, the butyrometer was centrifuged at 1100 rpm for 5 min in a Gerber centrifuge. The crude fat content (%) was directly read from butyrometer graduations. The crude fiber content was determined using acid and alkali digestion. Briefly, 2 g of fat- and moisture-free sample was boiled with 150 mL of 1.25% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for 30 min. After filtration and thorough washing, the residue was boiled again with 150 mL of 1.25% NaOH solution for 30 min, followed by filtration and washing with hot, distilled water. The residue was dried at 70&#8211;80 &#176;C overnight, weighed, and incinerated in a muffle furnace at 550 &#176;C for 5&#8211;6 h. The pH of the plant-based mayonnaise samples was measured using a digital pH meter (Model: pH N-81, Tacussel Electronique, Villeurbanne, France) according to AOAC method 981.12 [<xref rid="B39-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The peroxide value (PV) was determined according to the method described by Shantha and Decker [<xref rid="B40-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], based on the formation of an iron&#8211;thiocyanate complex.

FTIR analysis was performed to determine the functional groups following the method described by Chippie, et al. [<xref rid="B44-molecules-30-03511" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] with slight modifications. An IR Prestige-21 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with an AIM-8800 automatic infrared microscope (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and Spectrum for Windows IR Solution software Version 1.04 were used. Prior to the measurements, the desiccator was operated for 24 h to prevent moisture interference.

The panel consisted of 12 trained individuals (6 male, 6 female) aged 22&#8211;45 years, with prior experience in evaluating emulsion-based products. All panelists were non-smokers and regular consumers of mayonnaise-type condiments. Prior to formal evaluation, panelists underwent two 1 h training sessions to familiarize them with sensory descriptors and scoring procedures. Mayonnaise samples were spread on bread slices to assess spreadability and presented in randomized order under standardized lighting and serving conditions.

Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated that aquafaba, in combination with gum tragacanth, can successfully replace egg yolk in mayonnaise, producing emulsions with desirable stability, antioxidant activity, and sensory acceptability. The formulation with 25% aquafaba and 1% gum tragacanth showed the best balance of texture, viscosity, oxidative stability, and consumer preference. Beyond functional quality, these findings highlight the broader potential of aquafaba&#8211;gum tragacanth systems as clean-label, cholesterol-free, and allergen-friendly alternatives to conventional mayonnaise. Such formulations align with current consumer trends toward vegan, plant-based, and sustainable foods. Future research should address the extended shelf-life studies, rheological and lipid oxidation profiling, and consumer-based sensory trials to strengthen industrial applicability. Overall, aquafaba and gum tragacanth represent a promising platform for developing novel plant-based condiments with both scientific and commercial relevance.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
