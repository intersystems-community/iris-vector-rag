Introduction</title><p>In 2024, an estimated 150 million children under the age of five were affected by stunting, a condition characterized by impaired growth and development due to chronic malnutrition [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Indonesia has the second-highest number of severely stunted children globally, with approximately one in five children under five affected [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. According to the 2023 Indonesia Health Survey, 12.9% of children aged 0&#8211;23 months were moderately stunted, and 5.4% were severely stunted [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These conditions are more prevalent among low-income, rural, and marginalized populations. Stunting is a long-term nutritional issue influenced by multiple interrelated factors such as household economic status, maternal education, access to health services, and adequate sanitation [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the effects of early-life malnutrition can persist throughout an individual&#8217;s life and even extend to the next generation [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>To address childhood malnutrition and food insecurity, the President of the Republic of Indonesia, Prabowo Subianto, has introduced a nationwide free school meal initiative known as <italic toggle="yes">Makan Bergizi Gratis</italic> (MBG). This program aims to provide nutritious meals to students across the country, supported by a proposed budget of IDR 71 trillion in 2025. In its initial phase, the MBG program will prioritize students from elementary to senior high schools who belong to the bottom two income quintiles and live in Indonesia&#8217;s most disadvantaged &#8220;3T&#8221; districts (Tertinggal, Terdepan, Terluar). The Prabowo&#8211;Gibran transition team has stated that the program&#8217;s target groups, funding allocation, and implementation framework will continue to be refined and expanded to help reduce stunting nationwide.</p><p>School lunch programs around the world have evolved not only to improve children&#8217;s nutritional status, but also to reduce inequality, support local agriculture, and combat hunger [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These multidimensional benefits are also directly connected to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and SDG 4 (Quality Education). Positioning Indonesia&#8217;s MBG program within the broader SDG framework offers a future-oriented perspective that can guide its sustainable implementation. In many countries, these programs have successfully achieved such outcomes through clearly defined goals, appropriate beneficiary targeting, and sustainable funding mechanisms. Countries across the U.S., UK, Europe, Africa, and Asia have implemented structured, well-regulated programs that demonstrate the importance of strong policy direction, cross-sector collaboration, and robust nutritional standards [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Meanwhile, Indonesia&#8217;s current MBG program still lacks a written regulation and a clearly defined national objective. To achieve similar multidimensional benefits, Indonesia must develop a coherent policy framework that outlines the program&#8217;s purpose, target groups, and funding responsibilities. This paper reviews international school lunch models to inform the development of an effective, equitable, and sustainable approach for Indonesia. The novelty of this review lies in its comprehensive bibliometric analysis combined with a critical synthesis of international practices, enabling the identification of emerging trends, research gaps, and strategic insights specifically tailored to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of Indonesia&#8217;s free school lunch program (MBG).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-nutrients-17-02777"><title>2. Methods</title><p>This study employs a bibliometric approach to quantitatively analyze academic literature on school lunch programs. Bibliometric analysis allows for an objective assessment of research trends, patterns, and influential publications, making it an ideal method for mapping the intellectual landscape of youth entrepreneurship [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This approach provides a comprehensive overview of the field by evaluating metrics such as citation counts, keyword co-occurrence, and co-authorship networks, thus uncovering the research domain&#8217;s intellectual structure and identifying key themes and developments.</p><p>To ensure relevance and rigor, criteria were established for selecting studies specifically related to school lunch programs. In January 2025, a search was conducted in the Scopus database using the keywords (&#8220;free school lunch*&#8221; OR &#8220;free school lunch program*&#8221; OR &#8220;school lunch program*&#8221; OR &#8220;free school meal*&#8221; OR &#8220;free school meal program*&#8221; OR &#8220;school meal program*&#8221; OR &#8220;national school lunch program*&#8221;). This search resulted in 293 articles identified. This search strategy aimed to capture a wide array of research, encompassing foundational studies and recent advancements, allowing for a well-rounded analysis of prevailing issues and trends. Scopus was chosen as the primary database for this bibliometric analysis due to its extensive coverage of peer-reviewed publications across disciplines [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Compared to databases like Web of Science, Scopus offers a broader indexing scope and detailed citation data, making it advantageous for identifying research trends and assessing publication impact. Additionally, Scopus facilitates easy data export, allowing for efficient analysis in VOSviewer (version 1.6.18), a tool designed for bibliometric visualization.</p><p>The article selection process followed specific criteria to ensure the relevance and quality of the literature included. There was no restriction on publication year, ensuring comprehensive trend capture. This search yielded 293 relevant documents, which were then exported from Scopus into VOSviewer for visualization and analysis. VOSviewer was used to generate maps based on citation networks, co-authorship, and keyword co-occurrence, enabling a clear visualization of the relationships between authors, institutions, and research themes. To ensure academic relevance, a minimum threshold of keywords was set with a minimum of five occurrences. This process allowed for identifying clusters of research focused on similar themes and pinpointing gaps in the literature where further exploration may be beneficial.</p><p>Afterward, a literature review on the topics was performed. The previous databases were then filtered into 189 articles based on research title, focus of the study, and the findings of the study. Furthermore, the literature review was enriched with articles and relevant published reports retrieved from Google Scholar using the same keywords. Utilizing the same set of keywords, other inclusion criteria such as: (i) article in English or Indonesian; (ii) accessible full paper; (iii) fully published journals, reports, or book chapters were included, and (iv) note, review, and editorial papers were excluded.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-nutrients-17-02777"><title>3. Results and Discussion</title><p>The results will mainly be divided into two main sections. The bibliometric results highlight the trends regarding school lunch program research, and the literature review results specify the purposes, targeting, impacts, and implications of school lunch programs.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-nutrients-17-02777"><title>3.1. Bibliometric Findings</title><sec id="sec3dot1dot1-nutrients-17-02777"><title>3.1.1. Time Distribution of Research</title><p><xref rid="nutrients-17-02777-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> depicts the temporal distribution of research records spanning from 1973 to 2025, illustrating the fluctuating progression of academic output over this period. Early years, particularly from 1973 to 2005, exhibit minimal activity, with sporadic records that reflect a limited engagement or emerging interest in the subject area. This period is characterized by relatively isolated contributions, with records ranging from one to three annually, indicating nascent scholarly attention.</p><p>A notable shift is observed post-2006, where there is a gradual increase in research output, reaching a modest peak of six records in 2007. This growth may signal an expanding awareness or data availability in the field. Between 2008 and 2010, a slight decline was observed, but this was followed by a significant surge starting in 2011, where records consistently climbed, culminating in a marked peak of 28 records in 2020&#8212;the highest in the dataset. This peak likely reflects an intense period of academic focus, possibly fueled by contemporary global challenges or advancements in the field.</p><p>Subsequent years (2021&#8211;2025) demonstrate sustained high output, averaging around 25 records annually, indicative of a stable and mature research interest. The consistency in records during this period suggests that the subject remains a focal point of academic inquiry, potentially driven by ongoing developments, policy implications, or interdisciplinary relevance. The slight variability in these later years could also correspond to shifts in funding priorities, methodological advancements, or external socio-economic factors influencing research production.</p><p>Overall, the distribution underscores an evolving trajectory of scholarly engagement, transitioning from an emerging to an established field of study, marked by significant peaks and sustained interest in recent years.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot2-nutrients-17-02777"><title>3.1.2.

In Asia, Japan emerges as notable contributors with 6 records, reflecting growing regional interest. Meanwhile, Latin American nations such as Argentina and Brazil demonstrate limited outputs, with less than 5 records each, signifying a nascent engagement in this research area. Africa, Central Asia, and parts of the Middle East display minimal or no contributions, underscoring a geographical imbalance in research focus. This suggests potential gaps in knowledge and the need for more inclusive, globally representative studies. Overall, the map reveals clear research hubs in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia, while highlighting the underrepresentation of developing regions. This distribution emphasizes the importance of fostering collaborative international efforts to address the uneven geographical scope of research.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot3-nutrients-17-02777"><title>3.1.3. Keywords Clusterization and Trend</title><p>The bibliometric visualization (<xref rid="nutrients-17-02777-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) presents a keyword co-occurrence network, illustrating the thematic structure of research related to school nutrition programs and public health. This analysis was conducted using VOSviewer, with a threshold of five occurrences per keyword. The network consists of multiple clusters, each representing distinct but interrelated research themes.</p><p>The most prominent keyword in the network is &#8220;national school lunch program&#8221;, which appears centrally with strong connections to various related terms such as &#8220;schools&#8221;, &#8220;child nutrition&#8221;, &#8220;diet&#8221;, &#8220;food insecurity&#8221;, and &#8220;health promotion&#8221;. This suggests that research in this domain heavily focuses on government-backed nutrition programs and their impact on child health and well-being. Another frequently occurring term is &#8220;human&#8221;, which reflects the study population and emphasizes research related to school-aged children and their dietary patterns. Other dominant keywords, such as &#8220;lunch&#8221;, &#8220;article&#8221;, and &#8220;child&#8221;, indicate that a substantial portion of the literature explores meal programs in school settings and their implications for public health.</p><p>The network visualization reveals several distinct clusters. The green cluster (nutrition and dietary studies) includes terms such as &#8220;diet&#8221;, &#8220;vegetable&#8221;, &#8220;nutrient&#8221;, &#8220;nutritional value&#8221;, and &#8220;food preference&#8221;. Studies within this group likely explore the nutritional composition of school meals, dietary habits, and the impact of meal programs on nutrient intake. The blue cluster (health and physiological outcomes) is characterized by keywords like &#8220;child nutrition&#8221;, &#8220;health promotion&#8221;, &#8220;school health service&#8221;, and &#8220;childhood obesity&#8221;, suggesting a focus on the physiological and health-related effects of school meal programs, including obesity prevention and general child well-being. The red cluster (food security and policy research) includes &#8220;food insecurity&#8221;, &#8220;poverty&#8221;, &#8220;food assistance&#8221;, and &#8220;social policy food supply&#8221;, indicating research that investigates the socioeconomic dimensions of school nutrition programs, particularly their role in addressing food insecurity among children from low-income households. The yellow cluster (school programs and evaluations) is centered around keywords such as &#8220;program evaluation&#8221;, &#8220;school health services&#8221;, and &#8220;school meal program&#8221;, highlighting a focus on assessing the effectiveness and implementation of school-based nutrition interventions.</p><p>Several emerging themes are evident in the network. Notably, terms related to COVID-19, pandemics, and food security indicate that recent studies have explored the pandemic&#8217;s impact on school nutrition programs. The presence of &#8220;epidemiology&#8221; and &#8220;longitudinal study&#8221; suggests an increasing interest in long-term health outcomes associated with school meal interventions. Furthermore, terms like &#8220;free school meals&#8221;, &#8220;parents&#8221;, and &#8220;policy&#8221; indicate a growing research focus on equity and accessibility in school nutrition policies.

Early Research Focus (2014&#8211;2016, Purple-Blue Keywords)</title><p>In the earlier years, research was heavily concentrated on policy-driven school nutrition programs, as seen in dominant terms such as &#8220;national school lunch program&#8221;, &#8220;food stamp program&#8221;, and &#8220;school breakfast program&#8221;. This suggests that early studies primarily examined the structure and impact of government-supported meal programs on children&#8217;s health and food security. Additionally, foundational nutritional concepts, including &#8220;nutrient content&#8221;, &#8220;calcium&#8221;, &#8220;retinol&#8221;, and &#8220;child nutritional physiological phenomena&#8221;, were key themes, indicating a focus on the nutritional quality of school meals.

Literature Review</title><sec id="sec3dot2dot1-nutrients-17-02777"><title>3.2.1. Existing Guideline for School Lunch Program</title><p>The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) is a federally assisted meal program in the United States that provides free or low-cost lunches to students in public and nonprofit private schools, as well as residential child care institutions. Established in 1946 under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, it initially focused on preventing undernutrition with calorie- and protein-rich meals. Over time, concerns about poor nutrition led to reforms, including the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, the School Meals for Healthy Kids Initiative in 1995, and the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) of 2010, which strengthened nutrition standards by increasing fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while reducing unhealthy fats and sodium. In 2024, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) introduced updated guidelines lowering sugar and sodium levels further. As part of NSLP, several initiatives like Farm to School, Smart Snacks in Schools, and the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) help improve child nutrition and expand access to healthy meals [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In the United Kingdom (UK), Free School Meals (FSM) aim to improve food access for children from low-income families who meet specific criteria, such as receiving government benefits or earning below a set income [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. FSM applies to students aged seven and above, while children aged four to seven receive meals through the Universal Infant Free School Meal (UIFSM) policy, regardless of income. UIFSM began in 2014 in England and in 2015 in Scotland [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To reduce gaps in meal access during holidays, the UK introduced measures like food parcels and vouchers, though support was sometimes absent [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In 2018, the government launched the Holiday Activities and Food (HAF) Programme for children from low-income families, offering meals and enrichment activities. It was expanded nationwide in 2021 with GBP 220 million in funding for local authorities [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>FSM policies vary widely across European countries, reflecting different national priorities and welfare models. Finland and Sweden stand out for providing universal free meals to all students, including those in high school and vocational programs. In contrast, countries like Germany and Spain implement targeted approaches, offering subsidized or reimbursed meals specifically for students from low-income families. For instance, in Germany, eligible families can apply for education and participation benefits that cover school lunch costs. In France and Italy, access to school meals depends on regional funding mechanisms, resulting in variation across localities. In larger French municipalities, for example, meal prices are adjusted according to household income [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Meanwhile, Denmark and Norway do not have national school meal programs, and students typically bring packed lunches from home. To address growing concerns about children&#8217;s dietary habits, Norway introduced national guidelines in 2015 aimed at improving the nutritional quality of these home-prepared meals [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In Africa, school meal programs have evolved from donor-dependent food aid into nationally led initiatives promoting long-term sustainability. Beginning in the early 2000s, the transition to Home-Grown School Feeding (HGSF) marked a shift from intermittent relief to structured support for domestic food systems, involving local governance and smallholder farmers [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Unlike earlier models, HGSF sources food locally, creating stable markets for rural producers and fostering intersectoral collaboration among education, agriculture, health, and social protection sectors. These programs address food insecurity, improve school attendance and completion rates, and advance child nutrition, economic development, and gender equity. Meals are prepared in schools using locally sourced ingredients, reinforcing short supply chains and strengthening school&#8211;community ties. While some programs still rely on donor aid in early stages or emergencies, HGSF increasingly emphasizes national ownership and sustainable resource use [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>South Korea&#8217;s school meal program began in 1953 as a relief initiative and evolved into a universal welfare service by the 2010s. It is defined by universal access, on-site meal preparation, and integrated nutrition education. Meals follow Korean Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) and use local ingredients through a farm-to-school system, supported by trained dietitians. The program also strengthens local economies and is overseen by a multi-level governance system involving school staff, regional offices, and national institutions [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A key development is the Eco-Friendly Free School Meal Program (FSMP), which was introduced to promote equity and reduce stigmatization. Although FSMP successfully expanded nationwide and improved access to nutrition, it created fiscal trade-offs. The use of school discretionary funds (SDFs) to support FSMP often reduced budgets for areas like physical education, contributing to declines in student fitness. This highlights the need for balanced planning to maintain overall educational quality while achieving health and equity goals [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Japan&#8217;s school lunch program has operated since 1889, formalized under the School Meals Act of 1954. Regulated by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), the program uses nutrient-based standards to deliver 33&#8211;50% of students&#8217; daily nutrient needs based on age-specific DRIs. Japan&#8217;s program maintains consistent quality and national coverage, promoting health and growth for all school-aged children [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Taiwan&#8217;s school lunch initiative began in 1951, becoming a formal policy through the School Health Act in 2002 and revised in 2013 to incorporate nutritional standards. Overseen by the Ministry of Education, the program combines food- and nutrient-based guidelines based on the 2011 Taiwanese DRIs, targeting about one-third of daily nutrient requirements. Both countries not only focus on macronutrients, but they also focus on micronutrients such as calcium, iron, and multiple vitamins, though sodium and fat are not yet regulated [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>China&#8217;s Nutrition Improvement Program for Rural Compulsory Education Students (NIPRCES), launched in 2011, is a centrally funded initiative to address malnutrition in rural areas.

Established in 1955 and reformed in 2009, the program provides universal access to nutritious meals for students in public schools, ensuring at least 30% of food is sourced from family farming. The policy framework promotes not only child nutrition but also sustainable agriculture and local economies. Meals are aligned with national dietary guidelines and are planned by trained nutritionists.

Purpose of School Lunch Program</title><p>School meal programs worldwide primarily aim to enhance children&#8217;s nutrition and overall health (<xref rid="nutrients-17-02777-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In Africa, 88% of school meal initiatives focus on improving nutrition, with a smaller fraction (10%) explicitly addressing obesity through varied and balanced meals [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similarly, China seeks to improve the health and nutrition of students in rural areas by providing nutritious meals and enhancing school cafeterias. While no strict food standards exist, schools are encouraged to incorporate nutrient-rich foods such as meat, eggs, milk, and vegetables, accompanied by educational guides on healthy eating for students, parents, and staff [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In Kyrgyzstan, the FSM program is specifically designed to improve nutrition among primary school children, particularly in food-insecure regions [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Likewise, in South Korea, the school meal program is structured to support children&#8217;s healthy growth and development through high-quality meals [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Beyond improving nutrition, school meal programs serve as a platform for dietary education, equipping children with the knowledge and skills to make healthier food choices. In the UK, the School Food Plan integrates nutrition education into the school curriculum alongside providing healthy meals through the FSM program. This initiative aims to instill social and moral values by educating students on cooking and healthy eating habits, promoting long-term well-being [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Similarly, Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s FSM program is linked to higher school attendance and academic performance, emphasizing the role of proper nutrition in cognitive and educational outcomes [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. South Korea also recognizes the educational potential of school meal programs, using them as tools to teach students about nutrition and encourage lifelong healthy eating habits [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Many school meal programs act as a socioeconomic safety net, ensuring food access for vulnerable children. A study in 41 African countries revealed that 81% of school meal programs serve this function, targeting disadvantaged populations to alleviate food insecurity [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the United States, NSLP policies in California and Maine have helped families save money, reduce meal preparation time, and lower financial stress. Parents in these states reported that NSLP eliminated the stigma associated with applying for meal assistance, allowing all children to benefit from free meals without embarrassment. However, concerns about meal quality and healthfulness remain, indicating room for improvement in balancing accessibility and nutritional value [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>School meal programs can also serve agricultural objectives by fostering connections between local farmers and educational institutions. In the U.S., the Farm-to-School (FTS) program aims to enhance children&#8217;s nutrition by integrating locally sourced foods into school meals, thus promoting healthier diets while supporting local farmers [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similarly, in Africa, 46% of school meal programs incorporate HGSF, which prioritizes sourcing food from smallholder farmers to stimulate local agricultural economies [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Brazil&#8217;s National School Feeding Program (PNAE) furthers this initiative by mandating that at least 30% of the budget for school meals be allocated to purchasing agricultural products from family farmers, reinforcing both food security and economic sustainability [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>School meal programs are instrumental in addressing food insecurity by ensuring reliable access to nutritious meals for children. In the U.S., the USDA&#8217;s Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs)&#8212;including the NSLP, School Breakfast Program (SBP), and Summer Food Service Program (SFSP)&#8212;are designed to combat food insecurity through structured meal provision [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot3-nutrients-17-02777"><title>3.2.3. The Price of the Program: Universal vs. Subsidized</title><p>Universal programs provide free meals to all students, regardless of socioeconomic background. In the UK, the introduction of UIFSM for children in the first three years of primary school led to a significant increase in participation and nutritional quality. Uptake among previously eligible children increased modestly, while a much larger rise was observed among children who were not previously covered, particularly in areas with high economic inequality [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B36-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. While this inclusive model helps reduce stigma and encourages higher participation, concerns have been raised about cost-effectiveness, as a substantial portion of government funding ends up supporting children from non-low-income families [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Subsidized programs offer free or reduced-price meals based on family income or other eligibility criteria. In the U.S., the USDA&#8217;s Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs), which include the NSLP and SBP, are federally funded and designed to support students from low-income households. Children from families earning &#8804;130% of the federal poverty level receive meals at no cost, while those with incomes between 130 and 185% qualify for reduced-price meals [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In China, NIPRCES takes a different approach by channeling funding to rural schools based on enrollment numbers rather than individual student eligibility. This gives schools autonomy to plan and deliver meals while balancing funding responsibilities between central and local governments [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Across African countries, funding for school feeding programs often comes from a combination of government sources (45%), international donors (51%), and local communities or private businesses (4%) [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot4-nutrients-17-02777"><title>3.2.4. Appropriate Targeting for Program Participant (Equality, Demographic, Justice, or Equity)</title><p>Appropriate targeting is essential to ensure that free lunch programs effectively reach children most in need. Across many countries, eligibility is typically determined through income thresholds or categorical criteria such as enrollment in other welfare programs. However, these methods often fall short in identifying all vulnerable populations. For instance, in England and Wales, although 31% of children live in poverty, only 18% receive FSM, with undercoverage affecting up to 20% of eligible children due to administrative barriers or lack of awareness [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A similar trend is observed in the U.S., where participation in the NSLP is relatively high among categorically eligible children, including those in foster care or from households receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. However, participation is notably lower among low-income students who must apply based on income [<xref rid="B38-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. While the CEP, which is a federally funded program that allows eligible school districts, offer a path to expand access by allowing schools with high poverty rates to provide free meals to all students, adoption remains uneven. In the 2018&#8211;2019 school year, only half of eligible school districts opted into the program, often depending on state-level administrative support and certification systems [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Beyond issues of under-enrollment, a significant number of food-insecure children are completely excluded from programs due to restrictive eligibility rules. In the UK, significant numbers of food-insecure children do not qualify for FSM under current criteria, suggesting that eligibility frameworks may be too narrow to address the full scope of need [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, children from families with &#8220;no recourse to public funds&#8221; due to their immigration status are often excluded from FSM despite living in extreme poverty. These exclusions raise important concerns about the equity and inclusiveness of current eligibility structures and show how technical definitions of eligibility can unintentionally reinforce systematic marginalization [<xref rid="B41-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Targeting strategies also differ widely across global school meal programs, shaped by national income levels and institutional priorities. In middle-income countries, 17 programs employ a universal approach by providing meals to all children, while 15 use geographical targeting in high-poverty or food-insecure regions. Only four programs adopt individual targeting based on specific indicators such as poverty, ethnicity, or malnutrition [<xref rid="B42-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

In Brazil, school meals are vital for lower-income children, many of whom arrive at school without breakfast [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In the U.S., NSLP increased the number of free meals served [<xref rid="B45-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and reduced food insecurity by 2.3&#8211;9% [<xref rid="B46-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

In England, a universal FSM pilot did not significantly reduce food insecurity but decreased stigma and family stress [<xref rid="B53-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Overall, while school meals serve as a crucial safety net for food-insecure children, challenges such as seasonal availability and varying program effectiveness remain.</p><p>Beyond addressing food insecurity, school meals shape nutritional status and long-term health, but their impact varies across different settings, particularly regarding obesity. In the U.S., studies show mixed results. The NSLP was linked to higher BMI percentiles in girls [<xref rid="B54-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and some research suggests that NSLP and SBP participation increased the short-term risk of overweight among low-income students [<xref rid="B55-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and contributed to higher BMI and obesity risk [<xref rid="B56-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, broader analyses found no significant long-term effects after policy adjustments [<xref rid="B57-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

In several African countries, such as Kenya, Mauritania, Niger, and Sierra Leone, families and local communities support school feeding by contributing food, labor, and financial resources. In Guatemala and Liberia, parent organizations are actively involved in managing food procurement and meal distribution. School catering activities in Switzerland also include parental participation, reflecting a collaborative model of school meal management [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

In the U.S., the HHFKA brought significant changes to federal nutrition guidelines. However, some standards were influenced by industry lobbying. For example, allowing starchy vegetables and pizza sauce to count as part of a balanced meal [<xref rid="B71-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Beyond nutrition standards, governments have also explored strategies to reduce food waste.

Barriers to a Successful School Lunch Program</title><p>School meal programs are critical in promoting child nutrition, supporting educational achievement, and alleviating food insecurity. However, despite their benefits, numerous implementation barriers persist across both high- and low-income countries. These barriers range from issues of food acceptance and meal quality to financial constraints and institutional inefficiencies, often varying by context yet sharing similar underlying patterns.</p><p>A major and recurring challenge lies in food acceptance among students. Even when healthy meals are provided, they are often rejected due to poor taste, unappealing presentation, or unfamiliar ingredients. In Thailand, for example, significant plate waste was reported, with students discarding large portions of rice, vegetables, and protein sources, undermining their overall nutrient intake [<xref rid="B102-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Similarly, in China, students&#8212;especially younger ones&#8212;frequently wasted vegetables due to oversized portions and poor taste [<xref rid="B103-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. In the U.S., studies in Texas and South Carolina revealed that low-income or minority students consumed fewer calories or wasted more vegetables, especially those unfamiliar to them, such as dark green or red/orange varieties [<xref rid="B92-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,<xref rid="B104-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,<xref rid="B105-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>,<xref rid="B106-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. These findings highlight the need for meal customization that accounts for local taste preferences and age-appropriate portioning.</p><p>In addition to food acceptance, the overall nutritional quality of school meals remains inconsistent. While programs in countries like Japan and South Korea are known for structured, nutrient-dense offerings [<xref rid="B107-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], other countries face issues related to overreliance on specific food groups. For instance, in Thailand, school lunches included excessive rice but lacked adequate portions of fruits, vegetables, and protein [<xref rid="B102-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. In China, imbalanced menus contributed to deficiencies in essential nutrients such as calcium, iron, and vitamin B2 [<xref rid="B103-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Meanwhile, in the U.S., competitive foods often exceed sugar limits, reducing the overall nutritional value of school meals [<xref rid="B108-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. These examples reflect the tension between meeting caloric targets and ensuring micronutrient adequacy.</p><p>Financial limitations also significantly hinder program effectiveness, particularly in low- and middle-income settings. In Africa, only 38% of nations provide adequate funding for school meal programs, with challenges such as seasonal access and conflict exacerbating delivery issues [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

In Canada, the absence of a federally funded program reflects a broader ideological stance that positions child nutrition as a family rather than state responsibility [<xref rid="B110-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], creating a systemic gap in national food provision.</p><p>Beyond funding, logistical and infrastructural challenges also limit access and consistency. In several African regions, poor road conditions, weather, and displacement interfere with food delivery [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the U.S., limited transportation and restricted meal-site hours reduced participation in summer feeding programs [<xref rid="B100-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>].

These barriers suggest that supply chain reliability and local access must be addressed alongside nutritional goals.</p><p>Institutional coordination and program oversight further affect implementation. In the UK&#8217;s HAF programme, delayed contract awarding weakened nutrition education delivery and undermined overall program quality [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

While the program may temporarily improve dietary intake and food access, it does not address the deeper root causes&#8212;such as poverty. To reduce socioeconomic disparities, countries like the U.S. and several in Africa focus their meal programs on low-income or vulnerable children, aiming to ease financial burdens and reduce stigma [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

To ensure effectiveness, the MBG program must have a clearly defined purpose and target population. If the goal is to reduce stunting, the focus should remain on early life interventions.

Cost Models in the MBG Program: Universal vs. Subsidized</title><p>There are mounting worries about money efficiency and vague goals of the IDR 71 trillion budget for Indonesia&#8217;s MBG scheme in 2025. Recent studies indicate that the universal method may amount to a waste of public monies spent on generalists and put financial stress on the government. Just like in the case of the UK&#8217;s Universal Infant Free School Meals (UIFSM), studies show that the universal school meal programs lead to greater consumption of nutrition [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B36-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

Targeting Beneficiaries in the MBG Program: Equity and Justice Perspective</title><p>School lunch programs need proper targeting to successfully serve the individual who needs help the most. To reach vulnerable populations in challenging areas first, while laying the groundwork for a national rollout, we recommend a partial subsidy MBG model that combines geographic targeting with a CEP-style mechanism. Geographic targeting directs limited fiscal resources to Indonesia&#8217;s most disadvantaged &#8220;3T&#8221; districts (Tertinggal, Terdepan, Terluar). Meanwhile, a CEP-style approach uses existing social welfare data to automatically certify schools in high need. This aims to reduce paperwork, avoid stigma for low-income students, and minimize the risk of resources being misallocated or failing to reach the intended beneficiaries. Together, these strategies balance equity, efficiency, and administrative simplicity.</p><p>Prioritizing subsidies in 3T areas should be done as a primary step, because these areas consistently show the highest levels of malnutrition among school-age children [<xref rid="B115-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. In addition, the government already has an official list of 3T districts and sub-districts, which is stated in Presidential Regulation (Perpres) Number 63 of 2020 on Determination of Underdeveloped Regions in 2020&#8211;2024. This aims to eliminate the delay and cost of new surveys or mean-testing at each school. By channeling subsidies where they are needed most and with the data infrastructure already in place, MBG can maximize impact per rupiah spent.</p><p>However, relying solely on geographic targeting risks excluding vulnerable children outside designated 3T areas, such as those in urban slums or suburban communities, who may experience similar levels of malnutrition. To address this, the MBG program could adopt a CEP-style direct-certification model, similar to that used in the U.S. [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-17-02777" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Under this model, schools with a significant proportion of &#8220;identified students&#8221;&#8212;children already enrolled in social-protection schemes like Penerima Bantuan Iuran Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (PBI-JKN) or Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH)&#8212;automatically qualify for higher subsidy tiers without requiring additional household applications.</p><p>Specifically, MBG could set an Identified Student Percentage (ISP) threshold&#8212;like the U.S. CEP&#8217;s &#8805; 40 percent rule&#8212;above which a school receives universal free meals funded centrally, while those just below the threshold receive a scaled partial subsidy. This approach promotes both equity and efficiency. Over time, as data coverage and budgets improve, MBG can lower the ISP threshold and extend the model beyond 3T regions, ensuring a clear, data-driven pathway to nationwide expansion.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-nutrients-17-02777"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>The study&#8217;s bibliometric analysis was crucial in identifying key research trends and gaps in global school lunch programs, providing a valuable foundation for the proposed framework for Indonesia&#8217;s MBG. The analysis revealed an increasing focus on sustainability, food waste management, and the integration of nutrition education into school curricula. It also highlighted significant disparities in implementation and accessibility, particularly in low-income regions. The most prominent research themes identified were related to government-backed programs like the &#8220;national school lunch program&#8221; and their impact on child health and food security, as well as the socioeconomic dimensions of these programs, including their role in addressing food insecurity among low-income households. Emerging trends included the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on school nutrition programs and a growing interest in policies that ensure equitable meal access for all students. Overall, the MBG program should concentrate on a system where subsidies are offered gradually and only to high-need districts. The program should be tailored to support early efforts that will reduce stunting. Implementing geographic targeting in 3T regions along with a CEP system can improve how fair and simple the system is. By using available social welfare data and deciding on clear limits, MBG should reduce the risk of leaving anyone behind and avoid wasting resources, laying a good foundation for future expansion. Measuring success by the effects on health and education is better than counting meals served alone.</p><p>This study, however, has limitations. While it offers a broad global review, the generalizability of its findings to Indonesia may be constrained by local specificities such as cultural and gastronomic preferences, local topography, and heritage. For instance, what works in a universal program in South Korea or a targeted one in rural China may not be directly applicable to Indonesia&#8217;s diverse archipelagic context. Future research should address these gaps by focusing on case studies that explore the effectiveness of school feeding programs within Indonesia&#8217;s unique regional contexts, considering the challenges of supply chain reliability and community engagement in diverse geographical settings. Investigating how different meal preparation models (on-site versus off-site catering) and the integration of local ingredients affect nutritional quality, student acceptance, and economic sustainability in various Indonesian regions would also be beneficial. These future studies could provide more tailored, evidence-based recommendations to optimize the MBG program and ensure its long-term success.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
