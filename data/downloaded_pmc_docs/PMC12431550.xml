Benzene and its metabolite hydroquinone are believed to be related to the occurrence of benzene-related leukemia. Epidemiological studies have revealed the link between benzene exposure and blood system tumors, but the mechanism of benzene exposure and blood system tumor immune escape has not been fully confirmed. Experiments are divided into in vitro experiments and in vivo experiments. In the in vivo experimental part, we constructed an animal model of chronic benzene exposure and a C57BL/6 tumor-like animal model. Through qRT-PCR, Western blot and Tumor formation experiment in C57BL/6 mice, we verified that chronic benzene exposure caused malignant lesions in mice. In in vitro experiments, we built an in vitro malignant transformation model. Through molecular biology experiments 9/3/20259/3/20259/3/20259/3/2025such as CCK-8, soft agar cloning, and Transwell experiments were conducted to assess the malignant transformation potential of HQ19 and PBS19, cell vitality, malignant transformation potential and malignant migration ability were detected respectively. In order to study whether the benzene metabolite HQ activates c-Myc transcription activity, we used experiments such as double fluoresin enzyme reporting genes to confirm that c-Myc directly binds to PD-L1 promoter to drive its transcription. This study confirmed that in the process of HQ induced malignant transformation of human lymphocytes TK6, c-Myc regulates the molecular mechanism of PD-L1-mediated immune escape through transcription.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Guangdong Provincial University Key Platform Featured Innovation

a colorless liquid with a characteristic aromatic odor [<xref rid="pone.0332277.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a Group 1 carcinogen, long-term benzene exposure impairs the hematopoietic system, potentially leading to leukemia and other hematological malignancies in severe cases [<xref rid="pone.0332277.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hydroquinone (HQ), a major benzene metabolite, is a white crystalline powder exhibiting potent immunosuppressive activity and immune escape potential. It mediates tumor cell evasion of immune surveillance by inhibiting inflammatory responses, modulating immune checkpoint molecule expression, and remodeling the immune microenvironment [<xref rid="pone.0332277.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332277.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Immune escape denotes the phenomenon whereby tumor cells evade or suppress immune recognition and attack through orchestrated biological mechanisms, enabling persistent survival within the host [<xref rid="pone.0332277.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During this process, tumor cells deploy diverse self-regulated strategies to circumvent immune attack, with transcription factors serving as key regulators. These factors modulate tumor cell immunogenicity and promote the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating gene expression, thereby facilitating tumor cell proliferation in vivo.</p><p>Transcription factors are proteins that specifically bind to gene promoter regions or regulatory elements, governing gene transcription by modulating RNA polymerase activity [<xref rid="pone.0332277.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. c-Myc, a prototypical transcription factor of the Myc gene family [<xref rid="pone.0332277.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], exerts pleiotropic roles in cellular processes, including the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0332277.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is well established that c-Myc is critically involved in carcinogenesis, tumor progression, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. This master regulator governs not only cell fate decisions but also shapes the tumor immune microenvironment. As such, c-Myc represents a promising therapeutic target in oncology.

Tumor cells mediate immune escape by expressing immune checkpoint molecules (e.g., PD-L1) or modulating the tumor microenvironment [<xref rid="pone.0332277.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332277.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>HQ induced cell proliferation and malignant transformation assays demonstrated that prolonged HQ treatment significantly promoted the proliferative and invasive capacities of TK6 cells (<xref rid="pone.0332277.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Soft agar colony formation and Transwell migration assays further validated that HQ treated cells exhibited enhanced proliferative and invasive phenotypes (<xref rid="pone.0332277.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1BC</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that HQ drives cellular malignant transformation and alters biological behavior.Transcriptome sequencing revealed dysregulated expression of immune escape-related genes in HQ induced TK6 cells (<xref rid="pone.0332277.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>), suggesting that HQ transformed cells evade immune surveillance via immune checkpoint imbalance. Furthermore, GEPIA2 and TCGA database analyses showed elevated c-Myc, PD-L1, and TP53 expression across multiple cancer types, with leukemia patients exhibiting high gene expression displaying reduced 5-year survival rates (<xref rid="pone.0332277.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>~<xref rid="pone.0332277.g001" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). These results further corroborate the critical roles of these genes in tumorigenesis and immune escape mechanisms.</p><p>The c-Myc/PD-L1 regulatory axis was investigated using multi-level experimental approaches. First, qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses showed that chronic HQ treatment significantly upregulated c-Myc and PD-L1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels (<xref rid="pone.0332277.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition experiments revealed that c-Myc suppression dose-dependently reduced PD-L1 expression, whereas PD-L1 inhibition did not affect c-Myc levels&#8212;findings that establish c-Myc as an upstream regulator of PD-L1 (<xref rid="pone.0332277.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).Dual luciferase reporter assays and gene silencing experiments further confirmed direct binding of c-Myc to the PD-L1 promoter at the 84&#8211;95&#8201;bp region. Specifically, mutation of this site abrogated c-Myc-mediated PD-L1 transactivation, demonstrating that c-Myc regulates PD-L1 expression through specific promoter binding (<xref rid="pone.0332277.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>~<xref rid="pone.0332277.g004" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Collectively, these results elucidate the critical role of c-Myc in HQ induced immune escape and offer mechanistic insights for downstream functional studies.</p><p>The study of the mechanism of tumor cells evading the body&#8217;s immune surveillance is one of the key mechanisms explored in the immune escape mechanism. In this study, we found that HQ induced TK6 cells (HQ19) were able to significantly affect the immune response of T cells through co-culture experiments and related gene detection. Specifically, Jurkat T cells co-cultured with KG-1 cells showed upregulated PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression (<xref rid="pone.0332277.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), indicating that HQ transformed cells suppress T cell function by enhancing immunosuppressive molecule expression (e.g., PD-L1).</p><p>To validate HQ induced malignant transformation and immune escape mechanisms, we established chronic benzene-exposed mouse models and C57BL/6 tumorigenesis assays (<xref rid="pone.0332277.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6L</xref>). Results showed that HQ transformed cells exhibited enhanced malignant potential and promoted tumor progression via immune escape pathways.</p><p>Despite these findings, the study has several limitations. First, reliance on in vitro models and short-term animal experiments, combined with a limited sample size in C57BL/6 tumorigenesis assays, may compromise result generalizability. Long-term carcinogenic mechanisms under chronic benzene exposure require further investigation. Second, while the c-Myc/PD-L1 regulatory axis was validated, specific molecular mechanisms (e.g., epigenetic regulation, signaling crosstalk) warrant deeper exploration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>The benzene metabolite hydroquinone (HQ) facilitates immune evasion and malignant transformation of TK6 cells.The transcription factor c-Myc can regulate the immune escape effect induced by activating the transcription of PD-L1. From this perspective, if the role of c-Myc in immune evasion can be confirmed through future clinical experiments, then targeting the c-Myc/PD-L1 axis may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for hematological disorders caused by benzene exposure.</p></sec><sec id="sec020" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0332277.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Original experimental data.part01.

</p><p>Dear Dr. Tang,</p><p>Your manuscript was reviewed by two experts in the field. I also quickly reviewed the data section. Overall, this is a valuable contribution to science and valuable mechanistic insights into benzene-induced carcinogenesis through the c-Myc/PD-L1 pathway, but requires substantial revision before acceptance. You must address four critical areas: (1) <bold>English language quality</bold> - the manuscript contains numerous grammatical errors and scientific terminology inconsistencies that significantly impair readability requires professional editing; (2) <bold>Statistical analysis</bold> - the statistical methodology needs clearer description, sample size justification, and more rigorous presentation of significance testing results; (3) <bold>Figure legends</bold> must be substantially expanded to facilitate reader comprehension, including detailed descriptions of experimental conditions, sample sizes, and statistical methods used; and (4) <bold>Critical cell line characterization</bold> - TK6 is described as "human normal lymphoblastoid cell lines" but fail to address their origin and relationship to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). TK6 cells contain EBV DNA. While TK6 cells remain appropriate for benzene toxicology studies due to their wild-type p53 function, genomic stability, and extensive validation in genotoxicity research, you must provide proper discussion including their derivation history and potential implications of any EBV relationship on their benzene-induced transformation studies. The scientific merit of identifying the c-Myc/PD-L1 regulatory axis is strong, but these fundamental presentation and methodological issues must be resolved to meet publication standards.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Sep 27 2025 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at&#160;<email>plosone@plos.org</email> .

Thank you for stating the following financial disclosure: [This research was supported by grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China (82073582 )&#12289;the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2023A1515140169)&#12289;Guangdong Provincial University Key Platform Featured Innovation Project (2020KTSCX048)&#12289;Research Project of Guangdong Provincial Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (20242044)&#12289;Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Education Base Project of Guangdong Medical University (JDXM2024048).].&#160;</p><p>Please state what role the funders took in the study.&#160; If the funders had no role, please state: ""The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.""</p><p>If this statement is not correct you must amend it as needed.</p><p>Please include this amended Role of Funder statement in your cover letter; we will change the online submission form on your behalf.</p><p>3. Thank you for stating the following in your Competing Interests section: [Has been submitted to other materials].</p><p>Please complete your Competing Interests on the online submission form to state any Competing Interests. If you have no competing interests, please state "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.", as detailed online in our guide for authors at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submit-now" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submit-now</ext-link></p><p>This information should be included in your cover letter; we will change the online submission form on your behalf.</p><p>4. In this instance it seems there may be acceptable restrictions in place that prevent the public sharing of your minimal data. However, in line with our goal of ensuring long-term data availability to all interested researchers, PLOS&#8217; Data Policy states that authors cannot be the sole named individuals responsible for ensuring data access (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-acceptable-data-sharing-methods" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-acceptable-data-sharing-methods</ext-link>).</p><p>Data requests to a non-author institutional point of contact, such as a data access or ethics committee, helps guarantee long term stability and availability of data. Providing interested researchers with a durable point of contact ensures data will be accessible even if an author changes email addresses, institutions, or becomes unavailable to answer requests.</p><p>Before we proceed with your manuscript, please also provide non-author contact information (phone/email/hyperlink) for a data access committee, ethics committee, or other institutional body to which data requests may be sent. If no institutional body is available to respond to requests for your minimal data, please consider if there any institutional representatives who did not collaborate in the study, and are not listed as authors on the manuscript, who would be able to hold the data and respond to external requests for data access? If so, please provide their contact information (i.e., email address). Please also provide details on how you will ensure persistent or long-term data storage and availability.</p><p>5. PLOS requires an ORCID iD for the corresponding author in Editorial Manager on papers submitted after December 6th, 2016. Please ensure that you have an ORCID iD and that it is validated in Editorial Manager. To do this, go to &#8216;Update my Information&#8217; (in the upper left-hand corner of the main menu), and click on the Fetch/Validate link next to the ORCID field. This will take you to the ORCID site and allow you to create a new iD or authenticate a pre-existing iD in Editorial Manager.</p><p>6. PLOS ONE now requires that authors provide the original uncropped and unadjusted images underlying all blot or gel results reported in a submission&#8217;s figures or Supporting Information files. This policy and the journal&#8217;s other requirements for blot/gel reporting and figure preparation are described in detail at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements</ext-link> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-preparing-figures-from-image-files" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-preparing-figures-from-image-files</ext-link>.

However, the statistical analysis isn't elaborate enough as a thorough search was needed on the readers' part for specific statistics. Additionally, conclusions and discussion could be elaborated in more details.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;The study offers promising insights into novel finding that c-Myc directly activates PD-L1 transcription, providing a new mechanism for immune evasion in benzene-induced malignant transformation. The study's robust methodology, large sample size, and meticulous analysis, which provided compelling evidence for the study. Moreover, the results obtained from the study are robust and provide strong support for the central hypothesis, effectively bridging a significant gap in understanding how environmental factors contribute to cancer and its ability to evade the immune system.
