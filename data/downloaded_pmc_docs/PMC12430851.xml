Additionally, the treatment success rate among patients completing treatment and the proportion of eligible individuals initiating preventive therapy was also considered.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Active case finding:</bold> This component involved assessment of the active case finding (ACF) teams being proficiently trained in recognizing vulnerable groups of the population, symptoms of TB, proper sputum collection, and referral processes; proportion of identified vulnerable populations; proportion of TB presumptive patients referred for testing with Ni-kshay ID; and the prompt initiation of treatment for current TB patients within 7 days of diagnosis. Furthermore, the proportion of notified TB patients placed on the 99 DOTS (ICT-supported adherence system) was also considered to ensure comprehensive and technology-enhanced care for better treatment outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Community Awareness:</bold> This indicator was pivotal with several key components. Tracking the number of Gram Sabha meetings held and measuring the proportion of stakeholders made aware of the TB Mukt GP WA campaign were considered to reflect the outreach and inclusivity of the awareness efforts. Additionally, the proportion of activities led by TB champions, sites displaying IEC messages, and the number of participants taking the TB Pledge were included to assess community commitment and involvement in the campaign.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Community Support:</bold> This indicator includes several critical components. First, it includes tracking the number of TB patients connected with Ni-kshay Mitr and receiving nutritional support in the GP/WA. The indicator also measured the proportion of TB patients or survivors benefiting from home visits and the experiences of TB patients in terms of workplace or neighborhood stigma, abuse, or violence. Furthermore, the overall quality of care and frequent follow-up counseling for both TB patients and their families was assessed.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>District Capacity Assessment:</bold> This indicator involved a multifaceted evaluation of key components. First, the indicator includes assessing the number of monthly meetings held by the District Tuberculosis Officer (DTO), where the TB Mukt GP WA Campaign Progress was discussed. Additionally, the evaluation encompasses the number of District Health Society (DHS) meetings, where TB Mukt GP WA Progress was deliberated. The assessment extends to the Selection of GP WA, involving profiling through the GP WA Directory, Demographic Profile, Vulnerable population listing, and Facility Mapping for ACF. It also evaluated the formation and sensitization of GP WA Support Groups and ACF Teams. The linkage of GP WA-wise mapped facilities with nearby DMC/NAAT sites, logistic arrangements, identification and sensitization of TB Champions and Community Volunteers, development of Supportive Supervision and Monitoring Visit plans, registration of Ni-kshay Mitr for nutritional support, and the budget allocation for TB Mukt GP WA Campaign activities were integral components of this comprehensive assessment.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>TB burden:</bold> The indicators included the TB incidence rate (44 cases per lakh population), reflecting the number of new TB cases reported annually. The TB prevalence rate (65 cases per lakh population) indicates the total number of individuals living with TB in the state. Additionally, the TB mortality rate (3 deaths per lakh population), providing insights into the number of TB-related fatalities, was also considered.</p></list-item></list>

The challenges identified emphasize the need for targeted interventions and ongoing efforts to achieve TB-free status across all GPs/WAs. The GP/WA TB-Free Declaration Status results showcase a mix of achievements and challenges within different GPs/WAs. Several GPs/WAs have made noteworthy progress, achieving the coveted &#8220;TB-free status,&#8221; demonstrating their successful efforts in combating TB within their jurisdictions. The attainment of TB-free status by specific GPs/WAs highlights the sustained commitment and effective implementation of TB control measures. However, the presence of GPs marked as &#8220;Not Qualified&#8221; and &#8220;Progressing towards TB-free&#8221; indicates areas where further attention and intervention may be required. Understanding the reasons behind these designations can provide valuable insights into the challenges faced by certain GPs and WAs in reaching TB-free status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>In conclusion, this study assessed the TB Mukt Gram Panchayat program in Rajasthan, revealing progress across key indicators such as program delivery, active case finding, and community support. The findings highlight the effectiveness of community engagement and robust program delivery in combating TB. Importantly, the study also introduced a novel framework for assessing TB GPs, offering valuable insights for other states to monitor progress toward TB elimination. Moreover, it exemplifies stakeholder collaboration across sectors in developing a verification framework for TB Mukt Gram Panchayat claims. This framework provides a structured approach that can be adapted and utilized to strengthen TB elimination efforts nationwide.</p><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" publication-format="print"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Pai</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Bhaumik</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Bhuyan</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>India&#8217;s plan to eliminate tuberculosis by 2025: Converting rhetoric into reality</article-title><source>BMJ Glob Health</source><year>2017</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>e000326</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi" assigning-authority="pmc">10.1136/bmjgh-2017-000326</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC5435272</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">28589035</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="book" publication-format="print"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Government of India</collab></person-group><article-title>TB Mukt Panchayat Handbook</article-title><publisher-loc>New Delhi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Central TB Division, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare</publisher-name><year>2018</year><comment>Available from: <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://tbcindia.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/956455182TB%20Mukt%20Panchayat%20Handbook.pdf">https://tbcindia.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/956455182TB%20Mukt%20Panchayat%20Handbook.pdf</uri>.
