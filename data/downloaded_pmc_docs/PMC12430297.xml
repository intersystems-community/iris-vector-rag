By analyzing dynamic changes in non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) and their components within needles, stems, and roots&#8212;combined with a phenotypic plasticity assessment, a correlation analysis, and a principal component analysis&#8212;we explored the carbon metabolic adaptations under shade stress. The key results demonstrate the following: (1) Increasing shade intensity significantly reduced the NSCs in the needles and roots of both age groups. The stem NSCs markedly decreased under L1 and L2, indicating &#8220;carbon limitation.&#8221; However, under severe shade (L3 and L4), the stem NSCs stabilized while the stem soluble sugars gradually increased. In three-year-old <italic toggle="yes">Pinus yunnanensis</italic> seedlings under the L3 treatment, the ratio of soluble sugars to starch in the stems reached as high as 5.772 g&#183;kg<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, yet the stem NSC content showed no significant change. This pattern exhibited &#8220;growth stagnation-carbon enrichment&#8221; characteristics. This reveals a physiological strategy for maintaining stem carbon homeostasis through a &#8220;structure&#8211;metabolism&#8221; trade-off under carbon limitation. (2) Shade adaptations diverged by age: one-year-old seedlings employed a short-term &#8220;needle&#8211;root source&#8211;sink reallocation&#8221; strategy, whereas three-year-old seedlings developed a &#8220;root&#8211;stem&#8211;needle closed-loop homeostasis regulation&#8221; mechanism. (3) Age-specific shade thresholds were identified: one-year-old seedlings required &gt;80% full light to maintain a carbon balance, while three-year-old seedlings exhibited enhanced root carbon storage under moderate shade (45&#8211;80% full light).

Introduction</title><p>Light, as the energy source for plant photosynthesis and an essential environmental factor for growth and development, significantly influences plant morphogenesis [<xref rid="B1-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], physiological metabolism [<xref rid="B3-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and population regeneration processes [<xref rid="B5-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At the metabolic level, light-dependent regulation (Cytochrome P450 activity) is intrinsically linked to stress responses. Light signals (spectral composition, intensity, photoperiod) modulate <italic toggle="yes">CYP450</italic> activity to influence processes, including secondary metabolite biosynthesis, hormone metabolism, and photoprotective compound production&#8212;critical adaptations against pathogen invasion, high-intensity light, and UV stress. Conversely, stress responses reciprocally impact light-dependent metabolism through signaling pathway crosstalk, disrupted light signal transduction, and hormone metabolic reprogramming [<xref rid="B6-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This bidirectional coordination maintains a dynamic equilibrium between growth and defense in complex environments. Insufficient light reduces light capture and photosynthetic rates, leading to inadequate biomass accumulation. It also constrains branching resources while prioritizing allocation to aboveground growth [<xref rid="B7-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Vegetation hydrodynamic models reveal that seedlings in dense plantations maintain stability through a &#8220;carbon&#8211;hydrodynamic trade-off&#8221;: when the xylem water potential falls below a critical threshold, carbon is preferentially allocated to the root vascular tissues rather than aboveground branching [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This resource reallocation pattern revises the conventional view of &#8220;priority allocation to aboveground parts,&#8221; underscoring the dominant role of hydraulic constraints in shade adaptation and integrating the idea that hydraulically constrained carbon transport will guide understory light management. The absorption of light, its availability, and the efficiency of converting absorbed light into biomass constitute the primary factors governing tree and stand growth [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Seedling adaptation to light directly determines species population regeneration and the restoration of degraded forest ecosystems [<xref rid="B11-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, elucidating seedling adaptation strategies to varying light conditions is crucial for forest vegetation restoration and rehabilitation [<xref rid="B12-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In forest ecosystems, light penetrates through the canopy or gaps to reach the understory. Plants regulate their canopy architecture and leaf orientation via multi-spectral polarization reflectance to optimize light capture efficiency and drive morphogenesis&#8212;for instance, the blue-to-red (B:R) ratio modulates the leaf inclination angle through polarization properties, enhancing the light utilization efficiency in shaded environments [<xref rid="B13-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Consequently, such spectral composition-driven adaptations of the canopy structure govern the spatiotemporal allocation of light resources within plant communities. Through long-term evolutionary processes, plants have developed complex morphological and functional traits that enable them to tolerate environmental stress caused by suboptimal light intensities [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. By dynamically balancing morphological plasticity and physiological regulation, plants optimize their survival and reproductive strategies in variable light environments. Studies have indicated that moderate shading exerts positive effects on plant growth, development, and morphogenesis, partly by increasing the chlorophyll content, while also effectively mitigating photoinhibition under high-light stress. However, under excessive shading where the light intensity persistently falls below the compensation point, the respiratory consumption exceeds carbon assimilation. This leads to leaf chlorosis and abscission [<xref rid="B15-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], resulting in slender stems, a reduced root biomass [<xref rid="B16-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a compromised structural stability, and impaired reproductive development. Consequently, optimal light conditions constitute an essential prerequisite for ensuring normal plant growth.</p><p>Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), primarily composed of soluble sugars and starch, represent direct photosynthetic products that serve as the core carbon reservoir and energy pool for plant respiratory maintenance, growth, and stress adaptation [<xref rid="B17-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], while also providing essential carbon backbones for the emergence [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and development of new organs (buds, leaves, and roots) during nighttime or overcast conditions [<xref rid="B19-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Research demonstrates that, under shade conditions, reduced light harvesting suppresses photosynthesis and constrains NSC synthesis, triggering adaptive carbon reallocation strategies to mitigate energy deprivation [<xref rid="B20-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. During brief shading events, elevated NSC levels&#8212;resulting from delayed starch-to-soluble-sugar conversion&#8212;provide emergency carbon reserves. Conversely, prolonged low irradiance modulates the NSC mobilization efficiency across organs through the m6A RNA modification-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of carbohydrate metabolic genes [<xref rid="B22-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This post-transcriptional control enables rapid responses to fluctuating carbon demands, preventing &#8220;carbon starvation&#8221; risks during droughts and other stressors [<xref rid="B23-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the NSC levels and dynamics regulate plant carbon balance strategies, resource allocation patterns, adaptability, and resilience in the face of environmental change [<xref rid="B24-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Pinus yunnanensis</italic>, an endemic coniferous species in southwestern China, exhibits an exceptional drought tolerance and adaptability. It serves as a keystone species for ecological restoration and carbon sequestration initiatives [<xref rid="B26-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, climate warming and anthropogenic disturbances have triggered regeneration failure [<xref rid="B27-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], suppressed seedling growth [<xref rid="B28-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and simplified stand structure, collectively hindering sustainable forest management. During natural regeneration, the understory light environment represents a critical ecological factor influencing the survival and growth of <italic toggle="yes">P. yunnanensis</italic> seedlings. Shading conditions, arising from alterations in the canopy structure, anthropogenic disturbances, or climate change, frequently modify both the light intensity and the spectral composition in the understory. These modifications subsequently impact seedling photosynthetic efficiency, carbon metabolic processes, and biomass allocation strategies. Field measurements have demonstrated that the photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD) in natural forest understories ranges from merely 2 to 18% of full sunlight [<xref rid="B29-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This intensity persistently approaches or falls below the light compensation point of <italic toggle="yes">Pinus yunnanensis</italic> seedlings. Given that non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) serve as critical physiological buffers against environmental stress [<xref rid="B30-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], light intensity gradients in such carbon-limited habitats directly govern the carbon acquisition&#8211;consumption balance (photosynthesis vs. respiration), thereby functioning as key threshold determinants for seedling survival [<xref rid="B31-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. When the PPFD declines below species-specific thresholds, sustained respiratory carbon losses exceed the assimilation gains, ultimately depleting the NSC reserves and triggering carbon-starvation-induced mortality. Seedling age, a key indicator of the ontogenetic stage, significantly influences the carbon storage capacity, metabolic activity, and environmental adaptability. These age-dependent differences may directly shape the response strategies of seedlings to shade stress. Research indicates that seedling age is a key developmental variable driving shifts in NSC allocation strategies. This process manifests distinct stage-specific dynamics under environmental stressors such as drought and shading. During the early developmental stage, carbon coordination among organs predominates, as evidenced by significant positive correlations in the soluble sugar content across the roots, stems, and leaves of <italic toggle="yes">Quercus mongolica</italic> seedlings. This mechanism ensures the efficient translocation of photosynthetic assimilates to functional organs, supporting rapid biomass accumulation [<xref rid="B32-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. At the intermediate developmental stage, a transition occurs toward inter-organ carbon conversion strategies. Under drought stress, <italic toggle="yes">Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> saplings in this phase convert leaf starch into soluble sugars to enhance the osmotic adjustment, while their root systems exhibit peak activity of antioxidant enzymes (APX, SOD) [<xref rid="B33-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. At the mature stage, an aboveground carbon prioritization pattern emerges, accompanied by a quantum leap in the carbon reserve capacity. For instance, <italic toggle="yes">Betula ermanii</italic> old-growth seedlings exhibit comparatively smaller NSC declines under severe drought and accelerated recovery post-rehydration, achieved through elevated starch reserves and highly developed root systems [<xref rid="B34-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Consequently, investigating the varying patterns of NSC content in different organs of <italic toggle="yes">Pinus yunnanensis</italic> seedlings under shade conditions is essential for elucidating their carbon allocation mechanisms and stress adaptation capacity. Therefore, this study investigated one- and three-year-old <italic toggle="yes">Pinus yunnanensis</italic> seedlings subjected to varying shade levels. We analyzed the response characteristics of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and their components (soluble sugars and starch) in the needles, stems, and roots, aiming to elucidate the mechanistic role of seedling age in carbon metabolic adaptations. The findings of this study will enable the development of age-specific carbon starvation threshold models, providing a theoretical basis and technical framework for <italic toggle="yes">P.yunnanensis</italic> seedling regeneration management, understory microenvironment regulation, and precision shading management in plantations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-plants-14-02679"><title>2.

The seedlings were transported to the Arboretum of Southwest Forestry University on 14 March 2024, for pre-transplant acclimatization. On 21 March 2024, transplantation was conducted using plastic pots with the following specifications: For 1-year-old seedlings, the pot dimensions measured 20.5 cm (top diameter) &#215; 14.5 cm (bottom diameter) &#215; 18.5 cm (height) with a target weight of 3 kg, while 3-year-old seedlings were planted in larger pots of 29.5 cm (top) &#215; 23.0 cm (bottom) &#215; 21.0 cm (height) with a 6 kg target weight. All the pots contained single seedlings and were placed on trays. Post-transplantation, the soil moisture was maintained at field capacity to ensure establishment. The experimental area was covered with plastic sheeting to minimize groundwater vapor interference. The seedlings underwent a 2-month acclimatization period under optimal conditions prior to the experimental treatments.</p><p>The experiment employed black shade netting to establish five shade treatments with varying canopy layers. To prevent lateral light interference, the periphery of each treatment plot was also enclosed with shade cloth. At noon on clear days, an auto-ranging light meter (LI-250A, Li-Cor, Lincoln, OR, USA) was first used to measure the full-sunlight intensity on open ground; shade houses were then constructed to deliver the target irradiances based on these readings. Five light regimes were created following [<xref rid="B35-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]: full sunlight (CK, 2409&#8211;2427 &#956;mol&#183;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>&#183;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), 80% full sunlight (L1, 1904&#8211;1973 &#956;mol&#183;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>&#183;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), 45% full sunlight (L2, 1025&#8211;1105 &#956;mol&#183;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>&#183;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), 30% full sunlight (L3, 697&#8211;777 &#956;mol&#183;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>&#183;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), and 5% full sunlight (L4, 156&#8211;236 &#956;mol&#183;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>&#183;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>).

The cumulative variance explained by the first two principal components reached 74.3% for one-year-old and 63.5% for three-year-old seedlings, indicating that these dimensions effectively capture the age-specific shading responses. In one-year-olds (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A), PC1 exhibited dominant loadings for the needle soluble sugars, needle NSCs, root soluble sugars, and root NSCs, while PC2 showed the strongest weightings for the stem soluble sugars, stem NSCs, and stem soluble-sugar-to-starch ratio.

Discussion</title><sec id="sec4dot1-plants-14-02679"><title>4.1. Organ-Specific Non-Structural Carbohydrate Responses to Shading Stress in Pinus yunnanensis Seedlings of Different Ages</title><p>In this study, shading treatments significantly altered the accumulation and partitioning of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in <italic toggle="yes">Pinus yunnanensis</italic> seedlings. We observed progressively declining NSC levels with an increasing shading intensity. Specifically, the needle NSC content decreased by 33% in one-year-old and 48.5% in three-year-old seedlings under severe shading (L4 treatment, <xref rid="plants-14-02679-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Under such high shading conditions, the reduced light availability diminished the carbon assimilation rates, consequently constraining NSC accumulation. These findings align with those of Board and Harville [<xref rid="B37-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], who demonstrated that plants with a high photosynthetic potential cannot fully utilize their photosynthetic apparatus in low-light environments, leading to suppressed carbon fixation. The root NSC responses exhibited distinct strategic patterns across seedling ages. In three-year-old <italic toggle="yes">Pinus yunnanensis</italic>, the root NSC content peaked under L1 shading, with the soluble sugars increasing significantly by 49.5% and the soluble-sugar-to-starch ratio rising by 171.8% (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This likely reflects a &#8220;root-preferential&#8221; carbon allocation strategy, where photosynthates are redirected belowground to sustain root respiration, osmoregulation, and fine root growth. Under the L1 treatment, the carbon investment in the roots enhanced sugar accumulation for osmoprotection while maintaining the starch reserves; this balanced allocation supports seedling establishment in understory environments [<xref rid="B21-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, under intensified shading, the persistent suppression of photosynthetic carbon assimilation shifted the root NSC dynamics from accumulation to depletion, indicating a sufficient carbon influx to meet the dual respiratory and growth demands, ultimately causing passive NSC depletion. This aligns with the &#8220;photosynthetic limitation &#8594; root NSC deficit&#8221; pattern observed by Dai et al. in Robinia pseudoacacia and Platycladus orientalis [<xref rid="B38-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Under the L4 treatment, the root NSC content in one-year-old <italic toggle="yes">Pinus yunnanensis</italic> seedlings decreased by 63.1% (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), with starch exhibiting a significantly greater reduction than soluble sugars. This indicates that, under sustained shading stress, the seedlings prioritize mobilizing stored root starch to maintain basal metabolic functions [<xref rid="B23-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. When the starch reserves become depleted amid a continuing carbon deficit, the soluble sugars subsequently decline, driving seedlings into carbon starvation [<xref rid="B39-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This &#8220;root-preferential&#8221; carbon allocation strategy in three-year-old seedlings under moderate shade (L1 treatment) aligns with their developmental need to enhance the root carbon reserves for long-term adaptive capacity. Conversely, the continuous decline in the root NSCs with increasing shading intensity in one-year-old seedlings&#8212;in the absence of a peak response&#8212;reflects the prioritization of immediate metabolic demands over reserve accumulation, further demonstrating fundamental differences in age-specific carbon coordination strategies.</p><p>Both one- and three-year-old <italic toggle="yes">Pinus yunnanensis</italic> seedlings exhibited declining trends in their stem NSC content under L1 and L2 shading (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Under mild shade, seedlings likely prioritize carbon allocation to the roots and needles&#8212;supporting critical functions like osmoregulation and photosynthetic recovery&#8212;while the stems, as non-essential organs, receive a lower allocation priority. Concurrently, the stems neither cease growth entirely nor obtain a sufficient carbon supply, becoming &#8220;sacrificial organs&#8221; that experience a carbon imbalance. This supply&#8211;demand disparity significantly depletes the stem NSCs, inducing mild &#8220;carbon starvation,&#8221; consistent with Yan et al. [<xref rid="B40-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As the shading intensified, the stem NSCs increased in one-year-olds, recovering to the control (CK) levels under L4 (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The three-year-olds reached peak stem NSCs under L3, aligning with McDowell&#8217;s &#8220;growth cessation-carbon enrichment&#8221; hypothesis: under extreme low light, xylem growth essentially halts, reducing the structural carbon demand in stems [<xref rid="B39-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This creates a &#8220;carbon demand gap&#8221; while the root&#8211;stem reserve starch undergoes passive hydrolysis, with photosynthates refluxed via the phloem to the stems. Consequently, the assimilates accumulate in the stem parenchyma cells, passively elevating the NSC concentration. This reflects a broader low-light tolerance in stem carbon homeostasis regulation with seedling age. Collectively, these mechanisms reveal physiological tactics for maintaining stem carbon homeostasis through structure&#8211;metabolism tradeoffs under carbon limitation.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-plants-14-02679"><title>4.2.

The one-year-old seedlings employed a &#8220;leaf&#8211;root emergency coordination&#8221; strategy: Under severe shading (L4 treatment), the needle NSCs decreased by 33% relative to CK, with the soluble sugars declining more markedly (37.6%) than starch (22.1%) (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), indicating the prioritized consumption of soluble sugars for immediate metabolic maintenance during abrupt photosynthetic carbon reduction.

The phenotypic plasticity analysis revealed elevated plasticity indices for the root soluble sugars and root NSCs (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), confirming roots as the primary responsive organs in one-year-old seedlings under shading stress. This aligns with Landh&#228;usser and Adams&#8217; conclusion regarding the &#8220;prioritized mobilization of root starch to maintain aboveground function in saplings under carbon limitation&#8221; [<xref rid="B41-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The correlation analysis further demonstrated highly significant positive relationships (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) between the needle NSCs and the root NSCs, root soluble sugars, and root starch, whereas no significant associations existed with the stem NSCs (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). The principal component analysis showed the needle soluble sugars and root soluble sugars as dominant weighting factors in PC1, with the stem soluble sugars contributing minimally to PC2 (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). Collectively, these findings indicate a concentrated carbon flux along the leaf&#8211;root axis in one-year-old seedlings, facilitating short-term adaptive responses through immediate inter-organ carbon translocation without establishing synergistic coordination with stems. Three-year-old <italic toggle="yes">Pinus yunnanensis</italic> seedlings developed a &#8220;root&#8211;stem&#8211;needle closed-loop homeostatic regulation&#8221; strategy.

This reflects a heightened dependence of the carbon assimilation capacity on a strong light intensity as the seedlings age. Conversely, under moderate shade (L1 treatment), the roots exhibited active carbon storage traits: the root NSCs peaked, with the soluble sugars increasing significantly by 49.5% and the soluble-sugar-to-starch ratio rising sharply by 171.8% (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This demonstrates a &#8220;root-preferential&#8221; carbon allocation strategy [<xref rid="B21-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], aligning with Chen et al.&#8217;s conclusion that &#8220;roots function as active carbon sinks under moderate shading&#8221; [<xref rid="B42-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The correlation analysis revealed that the needle NSCs in three-year-old seedlings showed highly significant positive correlations (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) with the root NSCs, root soluble sugars, and root starch, alongside a significant positive correlation (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) with the stem NSCs (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). This indicates an expansion of carbon flux across the integrated leaf&#8211;root&#8211;stem system. The principal component analysis identified the stem soluble-sugar-to-starch ratio as the dominant weighting factor in principal component 2 (PC2) (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). Combined with the minimal decline in the stem NSCs during shading, this suggests that the highly lignified stems&#8212;which exhibit reduced structural growth demands&#8212;function as stable carbon reservoirs. These stems form a &#8220;root&#8211;stem carbon buffer system&#8221; with the roots, consistent with Sala et al.&#8217;s mechanism of &#8220;organ carbon demand gradients regulating carbon allocation.&#8221; Notably, under the L3 treatment, the stem soluble-sugar-to-starch ratio surged by 355.2%. This confirms the stem&#8217;s participation in systemic regulation through carbon form interconversion.

Collectively, these findings provide critical empirical evidence for deciphering the age-dependent nature of plant carbon coordination strategies while establishing a theoretical foundation for age-specific shading management practices.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-plants-14-02679"><title>4.3. Ontogenetic Shade Thresholds Informing Regeneration Management for Pinus yunnanensis Plantations</title><p>This study reveals the adaptation thresholds of <italic toggle="yes">Pinus yunnanensis</italic> seedlings of different ages under shading stress. One-year-old <italic toggle="yes">P. yunnanensis</italic> seedlings experienced a 19.9% decrease in their needle NSCs under the L1 treatment (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and a 63.1% reduction in their root NSCs under the L4 treatment (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), indicating a fragile carbon balance and a high risk of carbon starvation. In contrast, three-year-old seedlings showed a 49.5% increase in their root carbon reserves under the L1 treatment (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), with the root NSCs reaching their peak (75.05 kg&#183;g<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). Moreover, under the L3 treatment, the ratio of soluble sugars to starch in the stem increased by 355.2% (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), achieving carbon enrichment. This is consistent with the findings of Sala et al., who reported that, under moderate shading, more mature seedlings allocate carbon resources to storage organs such as roots and stems, creating a &#8220;carbon reservoir&#8221; [<xref rid="B25-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, in the early stages of artificial forest regeneration (e.g., 1&#8211;2 years after sowing), it is necessary to thin the upper canopy or control the cover of shrubs and grasses to maintain a PPFD &#8805;80% of full sunlight in the understory, avoiding carbon imbalances and death [<xref rid="B41-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. At the same time, it is important to avoid heavy shading caused by adjacent tall vegetation or the excessive retention of the upper canopy. For one-year-old seedlings, the canopy closure should be controlled to &#8804;20% (i.e., &#8805;80% full sunlight); for three-year-old seedlings; moderate shading (canopy closure of 20&#8211;55%) can be provided to promote root development. The principal component analysis (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) indicates that three-year-old seedlings achieve system homeostasis through &#8220;root&#8211;stem&#8211;leaf&#8221; closed-loop regulation, while one-year-old seedlings rely on a &#8220;leaf&#8211;root&#8221; binary linkage. This suggests that, in the establishment of mixed forests, a stepped shading structure can be designed, with open spaces (high-light areas) retained in the one-year-old seedling zones and three-year-old seedling zones configured in the subcanopy (moderate shading areas) to simulate the light gradient in natural regeneration [<xref rid="B42-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This can coordinate the carbon allocation efficiency of the community while enhancing the overall carbon storage of the forest stand. Under the L4 treatment, both seedling ages experienced a root starch reduction of &gt;40% (<xref rid="plants-14-02679-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="plants-14-02679-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="plants-14-02679-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), triggering the risk of carbon starvation. This is consistent with the field observations of Nelson et al., who reported that the PPFD under natural forest canopies is often below the light compensation point (&lt; 18% of full sunlight), leading to the failure of <italic toggle="yes">P. yunnanensis</italic> regeneration [<xref rid="B29-plants-14-02679" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, regular canopy thinning to maintain the PPFD at 30% in the understory is essential to ensure the dynamic balance of the NSC pool.</p><p>In summary, implementing age-differentiated shading management can significantly reduce the early mortality rate of one-year-old seedlings while providing an optimized environment for three-year-old seedlings to promote carbon reserve accumulation and root growth. The enhanced root carbon storage and the established &#8220;three-dimensional carbon insurance network&#8221; under moderate shading for three-year-old seedlings mean that seedlings with robust root systems and ample carbon reserves are more likely to develop into sturdy trees, thereby enhancing the entire forest stand&#8217;s resistance and resilience to disturbances. Optimized shading management can improve the success rate of artificial forest regeneration, ensuring that a sufficient number of healthy seedlings enter the next growth stage, thus constructing a forest stand with a rational age structure and uniform spatial distribution, and avoiding large canopy gaps or homogeneous forest structure caused by regeneration failure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-plants-14-02679"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study elucidated the age-specific mechanisms of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) responses to shading stress in <italic toggle="yes">Pinus yunnanensis</italic> seedlings, revealing ontogenetic patterns in organ-specific carbon coordination strategies. The shading intensity drives the NSC dynamics by modulating the carbon-assimilation&#8211;respiration balance, confirming the disruption of carbon homeostasis under low-light conditions. Age determines the evolutionary pathways of carbon coordination: one-year-old seedlings exhibit &#8220;needle&#8211;root source&#8211;sink reallocation&#8221; characterized by preferential root starch consumption for immediate survival, reflecting a binary adaptation to short-term stress. In contrast, three-year-old seedlings develop a &#8220;root&#8211;stem&#8211;leaf closed-loop homeostasis regulation&#8221; mechanism, forming a three-dimensional carbon insurance network through cross-organ coordination that significantly enhances their shade tolerance and resilience. We demonstrate an ontogenetic progression in the carbon strategies, from emergency consumption (age 1) to systemic homeostasis (age 3), with organ coordination expanding from localized to pan-organismic levels. This provides novel insights into the age-dependent carbon economy tactics of plants. For the silvicultural management of <italic toggle="yes">P. yunnanensis</italic> regeneration, one-year-old seedlings require &#8805;80% full sunlight to prevent a carbon imbalance, while three-year-old seedlings optimize their root carbon reserves under 45&#8211;80% full sunlight. These light thresholds offer quantitative guidelines for precision light environment management and the ecological restoration of degenerated forests in Southwest China. Future research should address multifactorial interactions by (1) implementing combined shading and water stress treatments to elucidate seedling carbon allocation strategies and physiological responses under compound stress and (2) establishing long-term monitoring plots in natural forest stands to track age-specific carbon metabolism dynamics within plant communities, including interactions with neighboring vegetation and soil microbiomes. These approaches will provide critical insights for evidence-based forest conservation and management.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
