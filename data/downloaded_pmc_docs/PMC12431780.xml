It damages CD4+ T lymphocytes, which are central to the human immune system, leading to severe impairment of immune function.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This makes patients susceptible to various opportunistic infections and malignant tumors, ultimately threatening their lives. Since the first cases of AIDS were reported worldwide in the 1980s, AIDS has become a major global public health issue.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> According to a report by the Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS), at the end of 2023, around 39 million people were living with HIV worldwide. Throughout the year, there were approximately 1.3 million new HIV infections and around 630,000 AIDS-related deaths.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> While widespread access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly increased the life expectancy of infected people and transformed AIDS from a &#8220;lethal disease&#8221; to a &#8220;chronic and manageable disease&#8221;,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> this transformation has created new challenges - infected people have to deal with the complex psychosocial adjustment to the disease for the rest of their lives.</p><p>As a chronic infectious disease, AIDS not only seriously endangers patients&#8217; physical health but also has emerged as a significant psychosocial concern in the field of global public health because of the social stigmatization, psychological strain, and interpersonal relationship issues that it causes.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#8211;9</xref> In regions with limited resources, such as East Africa, patients continue to face multiple pressures despite improvements in ART coverage. These include prejudice, stigmatization, and challenges in obtaining a diagnosis.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10&#8211;12</xref> HIV infection is still a difficult illness for many complicated reasons, and individuals living with HIV/AIDS are susceptible to psychological and emotional problems. Tadesse&#8217;s research shows that, in regions with a high HIV prevalence, such as sub-Saharan Africa, up to 56% of individuals infected with the virus report experiencing perceived stigma.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This figure is significantly higher than that for patients with other chronic diseases. Bai&#8217;s research shows that AIDS patients experience negative psychological perceptions such as loneliness, irritability, anxiety, negativity, and discrimination.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> At the same time, people living with HIV face crises of self-identity and challenges in managing their emotions. A study of HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM)found that patients generally experience a &#8220;self-disclosure dilemma&#8221; after diagnosis, facing significant psychological conflict when deciding whether to disclose their infection status to others.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Patients are often trapped in self-condemnation and even actively hide their condition to avoid being ostracized by society&#8217;s moralizing judgements about the means of transmission of the disease. This &#8220;double pressure&#8221; - the need to cope with the threat of the disease itself as well as social discrimination - further increases the psychological load on the patient. The Machisa study found that women with HIV had suffered from emotional neglect and significant stress after receiving their diagnosis, which is even more worrisome.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> A lack of support networks and depressive symptoms were identified as factors that contributed to their psychological distress. A lack of social support, such as inadequate medical insurance and insufficient family support, can leave patients feeling isolated and helpless. Some patients are forced to interrupt treatment due to financial pressures or an unequal distribution of resources,<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> which threatens their health, affects their ability to manage their condition, and impacts their quality of life. The chronic nature of HIV, its potentially lethal characteristics and the current inability to cure it completely make patients extremely susceptible to negative emotions such as fear, anxiety and depression.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> When combined with the emotional impact of diagnosis, this can lead to severe mental distress and have a cumulative negative effect on patients&#8217; mental health.</p><p>In recent years, the international community has set a new target based on the &#8220;90&#8211;90-90&#8221; prevention and control goals: &#8220;90% of infected individuals should achieve a high quality of life through virological suppression&#8221;.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20&#8211;22</xref> This highlights the central role of psychosocial health in the overall prevention and control of HIV/AIDS. The health outcomes of people living with HIV/AIDS are influenced not only by biomedical factors, but also by the sociocultural environment, psychological adaptation processes and behavioral coping strategies. The link between disease management and psychosocial factors is intricate and dynamic. Patients who are stigmatized tend to hide their illness, which makes it harder for them to engage in social activities as usual. Their mental health and social integration are significantly impacted, which negatively affects illness management and treatment compliance. Therefore, developing a thorough understanding of the psychosocial experiences and coping strategies of people living with HIV/AIDS is crucial for optimizing the overall care model for this condition.</p><p>Qualitative research can deeply explore the subjective experience of patients, understand the psychological distress and social challenges they face in the diagnosis of the disease, the treatment process, and their daily lives, and provide rich and detailed information for a comprehensive understanding of the real situation of AIDS patients.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Although qualitative research has revealed more about the psychological experience of AIDS patients in recent years, existing results are fragmented and limited in their interpretation of patients&#8217; overall state of being.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24&#8211;26</xref> As a sophisticated approach to evidence synthesis, meta-integration can transcend the limitations of a single study&#8217;s explanatory power to construct a more comprehensive and generalized theoretical framework.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> By conducting a thorough search, applying strict screening criteria, carrying out scientific evaluations and deeply integrating relevant qualitative studies, themes that are common and universal can be identified, and potential links and patterns between different studies can be explored. This will make it possible to build a more thorough, in-depth, and theoretically sound model of the psychological experiences and reactions of AIDS patients. The aim is to provide clinical medical personnel, psychologists and social workers with more targeted and practical guidance, to promote the optimization and improvement of relevant interventions and support services, and to improve the psychosocial adaptation and quality of life of AIDS patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Literature Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title><p>Inclusion criteria: (1) The research subjects are HIV-positive patients, regardless of age and gender; (2) The phenomenon of interest is the exploration of the social and psychological experiences and/or coping strategies or processes of people living with HIV/AIDS.

A thematic synthesis approach as outlined by Thomas and Harden was used. Thomas and Harden&#8217;s approach to theme synthesis consists of three steps: initial line-by-line coding, descriptive themes construction, and analytical themes generation. Researchers trained in evidence-based care methodology were trained to summarize similar results and form new categories after reading the understanding set repeatedly, analyzing the included literature, and finally summarizing the categories into integrated results to form new interpretations. Firstly, the researchers carefully read each article to gain a comprehensive understanding of its content, before conducting an initial code of the results section of each article. These initial codes were then grouped to form descriptive themes, highlighting the commonalities and differences between the review guidelines. These descriptive themes were refined through group discussions and synthesized into analytical themes that aligned with our research objectives. The identification of analytical themes then emerged through repeated discussions. Based on these themes, the research team conducted further discussions and reviews to determine the final analytical themes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0003"><title>Results</title><sec id="s0003-s2001"><title>Literature Search Results</title><p>1677 duplicates were removed, leaving 1015 documents.

The psychosocial dilemma of the patient is essentially a double victimization of the stigma of the disease: a vicious circle of institutional discrimination in external society, such as exclusion from employment and differential treatment in health care, and self-stigmatization at the individual level, such as moral attribution and denial of self-worth.<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45&#8211;47</xref> This result is consistent with Goffman&#8217;s &#8220;stigma theory&#8221; since patients who have a &#8220;devalued social identity&#8221; not only experience rejection from social labels but also internalize the stigma as a component of their self-perception. Stigma is internalized as part of self-perception.<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> It is important to note that the current study confirms earlier findings regarding the intergenerational transmission effect of stigmatization: teenage patients are subjected to social discipline pressure in the family field beforehand because of self-denial and overprotective or accusatory parents. Because &#8220;sexuality&#8221; is banned in traditional notions, elderly patients face moral judgment from their children, underscoring the cultural heterogeneity of stigmatization in various age groups. This highlights the cultural specificity of stigmatization in different age groups. This &#8220;internalization of stigma&#8221; not only exacerbates the self-identity crisis, but also leads to the patient actively choosing social isolation, creating a &#8220;self-fulfilling stigma prophecy&#8221;: self-isolation due to the fear of discrimination, which counter-enforces others&#8217; stereotypes of them as &#8220;dangerous or unclean&#8221; stereotypes. For high-stigma risk groups, such as sexually transmitted infections and adolescent patients, cognitive reconstruction workshops were conducted to break the false association that &#8220;illness equals moral defect&#8221;. By &#8220;de-labeling communication&#8221;, medical personnel restore patients&#8217; dignity during treatment and enhance their quality of life.</p><p>According to studies, people who receive an AIDS diagnosis go through a significant psychological shock and feel depressed, anxious, and afraid. Some patients experience long-term self-denial and hopelessness about the future because they struggle to acknowledge that they have the illness. At the same time, the stereotypical image of AIDS patients in society places them in a dilemma of self-perception. They do not know how to find a balance between their identities as &#8220;AIDS patients&#8221; and &#8220;normal members of society&#8221; and are in a constant state of self-contradiction.<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Many patients&#8217; self-stigmatization is exacerbated by the various forms of social discrimination they encounter. Some patients are made to feel inferior by the negligent behavior of medical personnel when they seek medical attention; in their daily lives, their coworkers and neighbors purposefully avoid them after learning about their conditions, and even some of their friends and family members find it hard to accept them.<xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50&#8211;52</xref> This widespread discrimination is rooted in the public&#8217;s lack of knowledge about AIDS and the fear of spreading the disease, which leads to prejudice against patients. The stigma of the disease keeps patients in a state of self-isolation for a long time and they are reluctant to talk about it, which seriously affects their social interactions and prevents them from integrating into normal social life. Therefore, health care providers, support groups and mental health professionals need to help people with HIV integrate into their daily lives by providing comprehensive care, counselling and psychosocial support, with health care professionals using their professional knowledge to dispel patients&#8217; doubts and denials, guide them in managing their disease, and help them adapt to and accept their disease. Psychological counsellors listen to patients&#8217; inner concerns and help them alleviate their psychological pain and cope with stigmatizing pressures through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and positive thinking stress reduction therapy. Social groups use various channels such as community outreach, school education and media publicity to disseminate knowledge about AIDS prevention and treatment, correct public misconceptions about AIDS, reduce discrimination against patients and create a social atmosphere of understanding and tolerance.</p><p>Social support can take many different forms, such as family, group, state, or treatment. Support systems are designed to give patients emotional and affective support and enhance their mental health. Families provide significant material and moral support, comprehend the circumstances and challenges faced by HIV patients, remind patients to take their medication, encourage them to adhere to the treatment plan, assist them during difficult times, and actively participate in their care.<xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Peer support groups are essential for fostering safe spaces, lowering feelings of loneliness, and fostering relationships of healing that allow individuals living with HIV to freely and safely express their anxieties;<xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> and the state facilitates HIV maintenance and treatment by offering pertinent preferential policies, as well as continuous medical and psychosocial assistance. However, community support is still relatively weak and there is a lack of professional psychological counselling services and peer support organizations, making it difficult for patients to receive ongoing psychological care and support. Additionally, some patients face enormous financial pressures during treatment due to economic difficulties, and the social assistance system fails to provide timely and effective support.<xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to establish professional psychological counselling services to provide patients with regular psychological counselling and psychological guidance; to develop peer support organizations so that patients can gain emotional resonance and practical experience through mutual exchange; and to optimize the social assistance system to provide more financial support to patients in financial difficulties and alleviate their treatment burden.</p></sec><sec id="s0007"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study also has some limitations. Firstly, the literature included is heavily dominated by English and Chinese, with French, Portuguese and other regions under-represented in the research. Most of the articles reviewed emphasized the predominance of adults living with HIV, and few focused specifically on children or pregnant women, making it difficult to generalize the findings to other specific populations. Secondly, the study was published over a long period of time, making it difficult to ensure that the integrated results reflect the most recent psychosocial status and coping patterns of people living with HIV today in real time. Finally, while some research has indicated that patients&#8217; involvement in mutual aid organizations can offer some psychological support, the meta-integration was unable to accurately quantify the causal relationship between mutual aid organization participation and the extent of psychological status improvement. This somewhat restricts the data&#8217; exact guiding function for the development of clinical therapies and policy.</p></sec><sec id="s0008"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This meta-synthesis describes the profound psychosocial challenges experienced by people with HIV/AIDS under the shadow of stigma. It also demonstrates the variety of coping mechanisms and inner fortitude they exhibit in order to adjust, endure, and develop. According to the study&#8217;s findings, patients typically endure severe, multifaceted stigmatization and discrimination, which has a significant negative impact on their mental health, social support, and mental health. It highlights the important role of &#8220;stigmatization&#8221; as a core driving force and its close connection to mental health and social relationships. Emphasized the core buffering and facilitating roles of &#8220;social support&#8221; and &#8220;resilience&#8221; in the coping process. The study revealed that the social and psychological experiences of HIV/AIDS patients exhibit a complex chain of events involving &#8220;stigmatization, adaptation difficulties, and coping differentiation&#8221;. To overcome this dilemma, it is necessary to empower individuals by providing comprehensive disease self-management education and psychological adjustment skills, supporting patients in developing positive coping strategies, and enhancing their autonomy and sense of control. Healthcare professionals receive sensitivity training and learn communication skills to provide non-discriminatory medical services that are respectful of privacy, informative and emotionally supportive. Families are encouraged to participate and are provided with support, while professional, confidential peer support programmes are developed and promoted to establish a strong social support system. The government should improve anti-discrimination laws and regulations and ensure their enforcement to protect patients&#8217; rights to employment, medical care, education, etc. Increase investment in HIV-related mental health services and social support projects. By focusing on three key areas &#8212; empowering individuals, restructuring social support systems and ensuring policy safeguards &#8212; we can build a more inclusive and sustainable care ecosystem, improve the quality of life for people living with HIV/AIDS, and ultimately achieve the global vision of a &#8220;zero discrimination society&#8221;.</p></sec></body><back><sec
