In most cats, FCoV primarily infects the gastrointestinal tract and remains asymptomatic or causes only mild enteritis, with only a small proportion of infected cats developing FIP. An excessive and harmful immune response leading to characteristic (pyo)granulomatous phlebitis is believed to play a key role in the development of FIP, along with complex interactions between host and viral factors. Our research group recently demonstrated successful treatment of cats with naturally occurring FIP using the antiviral nucleoside analogue GS-441524. Treatment led to complete recovery without any relapses for a follow-up period of one year, demonstrating both a short- and long-term cure. To investigate differential gene expression and corresponding molecular pathways in cats with FIP before, during, and after antiviral treatment, RNA sequencing was performed on full blood samples of 18 cats treated successfully in a prospective study. Samples were analyzed before treatment, at different timepoints while on treatment with GS-441524 and after completion of treatment. Additionally, gene expression profiles were compared to 12 healthy FCoV-infected control cats and 5 healthy uninfected control cats. The results revealed both a widespread dysregulation of the blood RNA signature in cats with FIP as well as its rapid normalization within the first week of treatment. Significant changes were already apparent within the first two days of treatment. The results of the present study suggest that elimination of the virus from the blood leads to rapid control and subsequent normalization of the damaging immune response, a finding that corresponds well to the clinical response to treatment. This study illustrates the host response to treatment at the molecular level and provides further evidence that a shorter treatment duration than the 84 days predominantly practiced is sufficient.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>EU project grant </institution></funding-source><award-id>848196</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>Part of this study was supported by an EU project grant (Grant agreement ID: 848196).

Their high genetic diversity promotes the frequent emergence of new variants with changes in cell tropism or host range, enabling interspecies or zoonotic transmission. Notable examples include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among animal species, the feline coronavirus (FCoV) is particularly important. It is primarily transmitted between cats via the fecal-oral route, where it enters enterocytes and typically causes no clinical signs or only mild intestinal diseases [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, in a subset of infected cats (approximately 5&#8211;10%), an infection with FCoV can lead to immune-mediated disease known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is always fatal if left untreated, with a median survival time of only 8&#8211;9 days after diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This progression is most likely caused by mutations in the spike gene (S gene) of FCoV, which enables the virus to infect monocytes/macrophages, to replicate successfully within them, and to spread systemically [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Similarly, the very early timepoints of treatment (days 2 and 7) largely clustered together and together with a group of day 0 samples that clustered separately from the other day 0 samples. Strikingly, day 0 and most (4 of 5) treatment samples of cat 10 clustered separately from other day 0 and early treatment samples but rather with Kn, Kp, and late treatment samples. This is consistent with the clinical representation of cat 10 on day 0. This cat had no clinical or laboratory changes, which can be typically altered in cats with FIP [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and exhibited only a minimal amount of free fluid in the abdomen during the ultrasonographic examination on day 0. The cat was clinically healthy, and FIP was diagnosed by chance by detecting FCoV antigen by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an altered lymph node found and removed during neutering.</p><p>To account for the differences between cats with FIP already at day 0, we used a multi-factor design for differential gene expression analysis that takes into account which samples corresponded to the same cat. This recovers consistent changes in RNA levels for each gene during treatment, even if overall RNA levels differ between cats. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs, multiple testing adjusted p-value [adj. p]&lt;0.001) between all timepoints of treatment as well as between day 0 cats compared to Kn and Kp cats. The results of this analysis showed that 9,763 (~75%) of 12,935 analyzed genes with mean read count &gt;10 were significantly differentially expressed between day 0 and any of the later timepoints, indicating an almost genome-wide shift in gene expression. It should be noted, however, that bulk RNA-seq performed here cannot distinguish between changes in gene expression for individual cells and changes in cell type composition of the respective blood samples. We therefore use the term blood RNA signature in the following to denote the combined effect of gene expression changes and alterations in cell type composition.</p><p>Most changes occurred rapidly early in treatment with ~4,000 DEGs observed on day 2 compared to day 0 (<xref rid="pone.0332248.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>) and &gt;8,000 genes differentially expressed within the first month of treatment (<xref rid="pone.0332248.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>). In contrast, far fewer changes were observed after the first week (1,170 DEGs between day 7 and later timepoints) and even fewer after the first month (36 DEGs between day 28 and later timepoints), consistent with the clinical presentation of the cats showing rapid recovery [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We then focused on the 9,605 DEGs identified between day 0 and days 2, 7, 28, or 168 and performed hierarchical clustering analysis of log2 fold-changes between any 2 timepoints to identify groups of genes with common RNA signature changes (<xref rid="pone.0332248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>). This identified 5 distinct gene clusters, representing either genes that were down-regulated (clusters 1 &amp; 2) or up-regulated (clusters 3&#8211;5) in day 0 cats compared to later timepoints (<xref rid="pone.0332248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332248.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). Cluster 1 (2,185 genes) consisted of genes that were strongly down-regulated at day 0 and to a large degree significantly less down-regulated already at day 2. In contrast, cluster 2 genes (3,002 genes) were only moderately down-regulated at day 0 with significant changes commonly observed not before day 7. On the other hand, cluster 5 (571 genes) contained genes highly up-regulated in day 0 cats that responded quickly to treatment, with 498 (87%) of these genes already significantly less up-regulated at day 2. Cluster 3 (1,106 genes) included genes moderately up-regulated at day 0 and cluster 4 (2,741 genes) weakly up-regulated genes that responded more slowly, but whose up-regulation was generally also reduced by day 7.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0332248.g002" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0332248.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Differential gene expression analysis.</title><p>(a) Heatmap showing log2 fold-changes for DEGs identified between day 0 and days 2, 7, 28, or 168.

The relatively low number of samples for control cats likely explains why less strongly pronounced changes did not reach the level of statistical significance for sick vs. healthy cats. In summary, the massive changes in RNA blood signatures in the first month of treatment compared to day 0 resulted from a rapid normalization of RNA blood signatures and reflect differences observed between sick and healthy cats.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>FIP is associated with a strong immune response in whole blood</title><p>To identify characteristics of DEGs, functional enrichment analysis was performed for the 5 clusters of DEGs identified during treatment with g:Profiler [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] for Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways (<xref rid="pone.0332248.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>).

Accordingly, strongly up-regulated genes (cluster 5) contained several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including 35 of 62 core ISGs found to be up-regulated in response to IFN across vertebrates (including human, rat, cow, sheep, pig, horse, dog, little brown bat, large flying fox, fruit bat, and chicken) by Shaw and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] (~27-fold enriched, Fisher&#8217;s exact test p-value 3.92 x 10<sup>&#8722;29</sup>, <xref rid="pone.0332248.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>).

In contrast, no enrichment for GO terms or KEGG pathways was found for genes strongly down-regulated in day 0 (cluster 1), but weakly down-regulated genes (cluster 2) were enriched for ribosome subunits. In summary, these results indicate a massive up-regulation of the antiviral immune response in cats with FIP, which is dramatically reversed already by 2 days of effective treatment.</p><p>To investigate whether these RNA signature changes in cats with FIP represent a switch in cell type composition of the blood, enrichment for human cell type marker genes from PanglaoDB, a database of processed single cell RNA sequencing datasets for the scientific community, was also analyzed [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This revealed an enrichment for monocyte, neutrophil and Kupffer cell markers among genes strongly up-regulated in sick cats (cluster 5) and for B cells (both B cells in general and na&#239;ve, memory and plasma B cells) in strongly down-regulated genes (cluster 1) (<xref rid="pone.0332248.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). In particular, the enrichment for monocyte and neutrophil markers as well as B cells was also observed for cluster 5 and cluster 1 genes, respectively, that were already significantly differentially expressed at day 2. Marker genes showing high expression at day 0 and much lower levels in treated/control cats include IFIT1, OAS1, LY6E, MX1 for monocytes and OAS3 for neutrophils (<xref rid="pone.0332248.g003" ref-type="fig">Figs 3b</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0332248.g004" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332248.g004" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). These genes also showed increased RNA levels at day 0 for cat 10, though not as elevated as in day 0 samples of other cats and generally not elevated beyond levels observed in control cats. B cell-specific markers with a strong reduction at day 0 and higher levels in treated/control cats include CD79A and CD79B, which form the B-cell antigen receptor (<xref rid="pone.0332248.g003" ref-type="fig">Figs 3b</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0332248.g004" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Comparison to routine hematology examinations for the 18 cats confirmed a switch in cell type composition under treatment: Increased monocyte counts (monocytosis) in blood were present in 15/18 cats before the beginning of treatment (i.e., at days 0 and 2), in 10 cats on day 7, but only in 2 cats on day 28 and the follow-up period (<xref rid="pone.0332248.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d</xref>). Increased neutrophil counts (neutrophilia) were observed in 10/18 cats before the beginning of treatment, in five cats on day 7, but only in one cat on day 28 and in none of the cats during the follow-up period (<xref rid="pone.0332248.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4e</xref>). In contrast, most cats exhibited a marked lymphopenia, i.e., low lymphocyte counts on day 0 before treatment (<xref rid="pone.0332248.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4f</xref>). Lymphocyte counts increased after treatment initiation, with a moderate to severe lymphocytosis evolving in 14/18 cats during the early treatment course (up until days 7 and 28). During the follow-up period, only a very mild lymphocytosis was still present in some cats. It should be noted that PanglaoDB does not include marker genes for lymphocytes in general, but only for subtypes such as B cells and T cells. T cell marker genes were not enriched in any clusters. The hematology results do not indicate such a dramatic switch in cell type composition that this alone would explain the massive changes observed in the RNA signature. For instance, while monocyte counts increased at most by &lt;4-fold, LYE6E expression increased &gt;13-fold. We thus conclude that the switch in blood RNA signature during FIP treatment is shaped by both a down-regulation of the immune response in individual cells and decreased and increased monocyte and B cells count, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0332248.g004" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0332248.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Selected cell type marker expression and laboratory parameters before, during and after antiviral treatment.</title><p>(a-c) Box plots showing distribution of gene expression for monocyte and neutrophil markers LY6E and OAS3 and B cell marker CD79B across cats with FIP for each timepoint of treatment.

Here, whole blood gene expression analysis of cats with FIP over all timepoints, of clinically healthy, FCoV-uninfected, negative control cats (Kn) and of clinically healthy, FCoV-infected, positive control cats (Kp) showed a distinct RNA expression pattern of cats with FIP on day 0 (before treatment) compared to other timepoints and compared to healthy Kn and Kp cats. This revealed two key observations: first, both FIP as well as antiviral treatment of FIP led to large and significant changes in blood RNA expression profiles, with ~75% of genes exhibiting differences in RNA levels before and during treatment. Second, the RNA signature rapidly normalized within the first week of treatment, with only minimal changes observed after the first month of treatment.</p><p>Genes strongly up-regulated in the blood of the cats with FIP were predominantly involved in antiviral immune system processes. Consistent findings were reported in a recent study that employed aptamer-based proteomic assays to analyze plasma protein profiles in 19 cats naturally infected with FIP, compared to clinically healthy, FCoV-negative (n&#8201;=&#8201;17) and FCoV-positive (n&#8201;=&#8201;9) cats [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

FCoV, thus, appears to be able to replicate primarily in the intestines with absence of viremia and without triggering a systemic immune response from the host and any significant effects on the RNA signature in whole blood. At organ level, however, a somewhat different picture was recently described by Malbon and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of FCoV-infected cats without clinical signs of FIP, many of the same processes observed in cats with FIP were also significantly upregulated at the RNA level when compared to FCoV-negative, clinically healthy cats. These included antiviral defense mechanisms, leukocyte chemotaxis, the IL-1 response, and interferon-related pathways. However, these changes were more strongly pronounced in cats with FIP than in those without. This led to the hypothesis that, in addition to the mere induction of these pathways, quantitative differences in gene expression might play a crucial role in disease development. Furthermore, the inflammatory triad of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF, along with CXCL10&#8212;a highly inflammatory chemokine&#8212;was found to be elevated exclusively in the MLN of cats with FIP. Taken together, these findings strongly support the view that antiviral treatment is not indicated in healthy cats that are infected with FCoV but do not develop FIP, as there is no clinical justification for such intervention. However, timely intervention and provision of GS-441524 to any cat developing the severe disease FIP is critical to save the animal.</p><p>We found that gene expression changes between cats with FIP at day 0 and both control groups (Kp and Kn cats) largely resembled the changes between day 0 and the first days of treatment, providing evidence for a normalization of the RNA signature early in treatment. Strikingly, cat 10, that had only been diagnosed with FIP incidentally during neutering, exhibited an RNA signature resembling healthy cats rather than cats with FIP before or during early treatment. This raises the question whether cat 10 was in an early disease stage and would have eventually developed full-blown FIP and thus benefited from early treatment or whether it would have been able to eliminate the infection on its own and would never have required treatment. Notably, we could not identify any gene marker for FIP that included cat 10 on day 0 but excluded healthy cats or other cats with FIP after the first week of treatment. For instance, while the monocyte/neutrophil-marker genes IFIT1, OAS1, LY6E, MX1, and OAS3 showed slightly increased RNA levels at day 0 for cat 10 and the B cell markers CD709A/B showed slightly reduced levels, they were neither elevated nor reduced, respectively, beyond RNA levels in some healthy cats or follow-up samples (<xref rid="pone.0332248.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0332248.g003" ref-type="fig">a&#8211;c</xref>).</p><p>The RNA signature of day 0 cats was dominated by a general antiviral response, with strongly up-regulated genes enriched for ISGs, also up-regulated in other viral infections. It should be noted here that most functional annotation for cat genes is derived from orthology mapping from other species, mostly human and mouse, thus we may overlook feline-specific immune responses. Nevertheless, the core ISGs analyzed in this study were defined based on up-regulation in response to IFN across a diverse range of vertebrates (ranging from human to chicken), suggesting they indeed represent a vertebrate-wide response to viral infections, including in cats. Most up-regulated genes were already significantly reduced in expression by day 2 of treatment, indicating that switching off the FCoV-induced excessive immune response plays a crucial role in treatment success. Thus, although there might not be specific markers for FIP diagnosis, the present RNA-seq analysis suggests a wide range of potential biomarkers that could be used for monitoring treatment success. Some of these markers indicate a shift in cell type composition in cats with FIP from increased monocyte/neutrophil levels on day 0 to increased B cell levels from day 2. However, while the hematological results in part confirmed a change in cell type composition [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the extent of changes in RNA levels was much more pronounced (<xref rid="pone.0332248.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). This indicates a cumulative effect of gene expression changes within cells and changes in cell type composition. Since cell-type composition inferences were based on human-derived marker genes (i.e., from PanglaoDB), potential interspecies differences between cats and humans or mice introduce a degree of uncertainty in this observation. Moreover, many of the cell type marker genes identified as differentially expressed, in particular for monocytes and neutrophils, are not completely specific for these cell types according to the human protein atlas [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], but expressed among a wider range of immune cells. This further complicates the interpretation of shifts in cellular composition. Subsequent flow cytometric analysis of key markers will be required in follow-up studies to further explore these findings and evaluate their relevance on a phenotypic level. Moreover, an investigation of their respective response to other severe disease manifestations in cats, i.e., bacterial sepsis, will be necessary to evaluate their specificity. Nevertheless, the results of this study serve as a crucial milestone towards the identification of biomarkers for FIP to eventually support diagnosis and treatment monitoring.</p><p>A generalized lymphopenia is a common sign in cats with FIP, and despite strong individual variations, a severe decrease in all analyzed subsets, namely B cells, CD3&#8201;+&#8201;T cells, NK cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) is frequently observed [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It has been proposed that lymphocyte loss in FIP is caused by increased apoptosis, most likely due to the release of pro-apoptotic factors from virus-infected macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This is consistent with our observation that expression of B cell-specific markers (CD79A and CD79B) was strongly reduced on day 0 but during treatment returned to a normal range observed in healthy cats. During recovery due to antiviral treatment, most cats with lymphopenia before treatment not only reached normal lymphocyte counts but displayed a rebound effect by developing long-lasting mild to moderate lymphocytosis [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Notably, lymphocytosis has also been described in COVID-19 patients after treatment with Remdesivir, which resulted in a significant increase in B lymphocytes while T helper cells remained unaffected [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Flow cytometry-based lymphocyte subset analysis during treatment for some of the cats of this study revealed that lymphocytosis was caused by a significant increase of both CD4&#8201;+&#8201;T-helper and CD21&#8201;+&#8201;B cells [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Increased activation of B cells in cats with FIP has previously been described, leading to enhanced plasma-blast differentiation of B cells and increased plasma-blast numbers in whole blood [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. If this activation of the B cell system involves B cell production in the bone marrow that persists during treatment, while FCoV-mediated lymphocyte apoptosis is halted by elimination of the virus, this could result in a transitional overproduction of B cells. The observed strong increase in CD4&#8201;+&#8201;cells under antiviral treatment might also be a thymic counterreaction to virus-induced apoptosis. FIP has also been shown to be associated with a strong Treg suppression [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>RNA signatures in cats with FIP rapidly normalized within the first week of treatment with only a few changes observed afterwards. These findings mirror the rapid clinical improvement of treated cats. In addition, they suggest that a substantially shorter duration of antiviral treatment might also be sufficient, as opposed to the previously established 84-days treatment protocol for the cats in this study. In a second treatment study we recently demonstrated equal effectiveness of a 42-day treatment duration compared to 84-days of treatment to achieve complete recovery from FIP [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, the RNA-seq data shown here suggest that an even shorter treatment duration of only one month (28 days) might also be sufficient, as barely any further significant modifications in RNA signatures (only 36 DEGs) were observed when comparing day 28 to later timepoints (days 168, 252, and 336 after treatment start). Furthermore, clinical and laboratory parameters that are typically altered in cats with FIP [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] were within the corresponding reference range by day 28 at the latest, and no further relevant changes were observed beyond this timepoint [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, FCoV, which was detectable in blood in 15 of the 18 cats before treatment (day 0), was no longer detectable in any cat from day 14 onwards [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Shorter treatment duration could offer considerable advantages. For cat owners, it would help alleviate both the financial and logistical burden associated with FIP treatment, given the high cost of GS-441524 and its limited legal availability in many countries worldwide, where access often relies on unregulated sources. For the animals, a shorter therapeutic course would reduce the cumulative stress of daily drug administration and limit exposure to potential adverse effects. One complication of GS-441524-associated urolithiasis, i.e., formation of stones in the urinary tract, was already reported for two cats undergoing treatment with GS-441524 and stone analysis confirmed that the stones were composed of 98% GS-441524 [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, a treatment approach reduced to the shortest effective duration will be of great practical advantage both from a clinical and animal humane point of view. It could enable the rescue of a much larger number of cats that currently cannot receive treatment&#8212;because of the above-mentioned reasons&#8212;and, therefore, still have to be euthanized. However, although the rapid normalization of RNA signatures is promising for a shorter treatment duration, further studies are needed to correlate these molecular changes with clinical endpoints in particular regarding relapse rates and long-term outcomes.</p><p>We conclude that RNA-seq analysis of whole blood samples during FIP treatment sheds new light on biological pathways involved in FIP before, during and after successful antiviral treatment. It highlighted key immune pathways involved in disease progression, treatment response, and recovery, in particular the role of an excessive and devastating immune response. DEGs identified in our analyses could serve as useful biomarkers for FIP diagnosis and treatment monitoring, pending further validation in additional trials. The rapid normalization of the blood RNA signature revealed by our study has exciting implications for more cost-effective shorter treatment of cats with FIP. Finally, the absence of significant changes in blood RNA signatures in cats with a non-pathogenic enteric FCoV infection is consistent with none or only very mild, transient clinical signs, further supporting that they do not require any therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Prospective sample collection</title><p>In our previously published study, 18 cats with naturally occurring FIP were treated orally for 84 days with the multi-component drug Xraphconn<sup>&#174;</sup> provided by Mutian (Mutian Life Sciences Limited, China), containing the nucleoside analogue GS-441524 [<xref rid="pone.0332248.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The diagnosis FIP in these cats was made according to the diagnostic tool of the Advisory Board on Cat Diseases (ABCD).
