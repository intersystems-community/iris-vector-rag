Venovenous and venoarterial ECMO are used for primary respiratory and cardiac pathologies, respectively (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Patients requiring either venoarterial or venovenous ECMO are at significant risk for ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW), with prior studies demonstrating that 67&#8211;80% of patients develop ICU-AW and significant muscle wasting can occur in under a week from initiation of ECMO support (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Examination and intervention by a physical therapist and early mobilization of all ICU patients is recommended by the Society of Critical Care Medicine as safe and effective ways to minimize the effects of ICU-AW (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Patient mobility on ECMO has been previously limited due to safety concerns, leading to increased immobilization compared with non-ECMO patients, which results in higher rates of ICU-AW (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Ambulation, intensive rehabilitation, and nutritional support during ECMO can lead to improved patient outcomes, including enhanced functional mobility and independence (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>ICU-AW is characterized by skeletal muscle weakness that commences as early as 5 days after ICU admission in up to 50% of ICU patients, with increased prevalence in surgical ICUs and in geriatric patient populations (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Sedation practices, neuromuscular blockade (NMB) use, and individual ICU culture leading to immobility impact the ability to initiate physical therapy (PT) in patients requiring ECMO (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The long-term sequela of ICU-AW include decreased physical and cognitive functioning, the need for increased rehabilitation after hospital discharge, decreased health-related quality of life, and increased caregiver burden (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). PT interventions, including exercise, mobility, and ambulation while on all types of ECMO, have been demonstrated to be efficacious and safe with a low incidence of adverse events (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Furthermore, adverse effects of mobility on ECMO, such as oxygen desaturation, cannulation complications, and hemodynamic instability, tend to be infrequent and unlikely to impact survival or clinical course (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Increased activity and the ability to achieve higher levels of mobility, such as standing and ambulating while on ECMO, have been associated with improved survival and discharge destination (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). For patients acutely experiencing and recovering from critical illness, rehabilitation and optimal discharge planning are essential to facilitate an improved quality of life and a return to independence (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This study aimed to investigate the association between the timing of PT intervention (on ECMO or after decannulation) and the frequency of PT intervention with functional status, survival, and discharge destination in patients supported with ECMO during their hospitalization.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a single-center retrospective study of all patients cannulated for ECMO between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021, at a high-volume ECMO center. Institutional Review Board approved this study No. 00004012, approval date March 26, 2022) and all research procedures were followed in accordance with the ethical standards of the committee and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected health Data guidelines for reporting observational data were followed (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><sec><title>Study Site</title><p>The study site has a well-established multidisciplinary ECMO program that includes physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, respiratory therapists, ECMO specialists, and perfusionists. Awake ECMO and extubating patients while on ECMO are common practices within this unit. The typical practice dictates daily spontaneous awakening trials and minimizing sedation to the lowest degree tolerated by the patient in alignment with the ABCDE Bundle. Spontaneous awakening trials are typically initiated on the day of cannulation and after arrival to the hospital if cannulated elsewhere, pending clinical stability as determined by the treating Critical Care Physician. Additionally, enteral nutrition is usually started within the first 24 hours with guidance from dietitians, as long as patients are generally stable and have decreasing vasoactive requirements. The standard venovenous ECMO configuration used was a right femoral vein drainage cannula and a right internal jugular vein return cannula. The standard venoarterial ECMO configuration consisted of a right femoral vein drainage cannula, a left common femoral artery return cannula, and a left superficial femoral artery distal perfusion catheter. Left ventricular offloading was dictated by individual patient characteristics and was done either with an Impella device (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) or with an intra-aortic balloon pump.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient Selection</title><p>Institutional quality assurance programs track data for every patient cannulated and initiated on ECMO. This information was used to identify all patients cannulated for ECMO during 2021. Patients in the cohort were supported by venovenous ECMO or venoarterial ECMO and were included if they were at least 18 years old and received ECMO support for at least 3 days. Those patients on ECMO for less than 3 days were excluded as it was determined that they would not have time to be evaluated for and participate in PT while on ECMO. Patients who had more than one period on ECMO during their hospitalization were also excluded. Patients included in this study were cannulated for ECMO within the study institution, by a referring facility, or remotely cannulated by the study institution&#8217;s ECMO team at the referring facility.</p></sec><sec><title>Physical Therapy Evaluation</title><p>The institutional practice for PT evaluation of ECMO patients involves a daily review of all cardiovascular ICU patients with the multidisciplinary team to assess each patient for medical stability and the suitability of PT, considering their mental status, ability to engage in therapy, and timeline for other planned procedural or operative interventions.</p><p>Patients deemed appropriate for a PT evaluation would undergo an in-bed PT evaluation for range of motion, manual muscle test, and a bed-level functional mobility assessment. If patients remained clinically stable and tolerated the initial evaluation, they would progress to an edge-of-bed assessment, a standing assessment, and an ambulation assessment. Depending on patient performance, these assessments could occur within a single PT session or during subsequent sessions. Patients not considered appropriate for advancing to ambulation would be given a goal of receiving PT 6 days a week for a 2-week time period until they were either able to ambulate, or a reassessment of appropriate functional goals was needed. Patients unable to ambulate after the 2-week 6 days per week intensive trial, had a frequency then set at 5 days per week to accommodate a slower recovery timeline. Patients who could ambulate were given a PT frequency of six times per week. The entire support team available for ambulation assistance included a physical therapist, an ECMO specialist or perfusionist, a respiratory therapist as needed for mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygenation, and the patient&#8217;s primary nurse.

The AM-PAC assesses a patient&#8217;s functional mobility, rehabilitation prognosis, and discharge disposition (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The AM-PAC encompasses six skills scored 1&#8211;4, representing total assistance by a therapist to the absence of assistance. The six areas scored are a patient&#8217;s ability to roll, transfer supine to sit, transfer sit to stand, transfer bed to chair, ambulate, and climb stairs. Patients with an AM-PAC score of 16 or greater have a higher incidence of discharge to home (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The AM-PAC score has demonstrated high interrater reliability across surgical, medical, and neurologic ICUs (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>AM-PAC scores were retroactively determined based on mobility tasks that were documented during PT encounters. Data collectors were trained in the use of a standardized algorithm to interpret objectively documented information and codify AM-PAC scores. Scores were based on the exact activities listed and the assistance amounts listed within the PT notes. If an activity was not documented, it was either given the score of the next higher level of mobility or scored a 1 if there was no higher level of mobility documented. Further description of AM-PAC scoring can be seen in <bold>Supplement 2.2</bold> (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://links.lww.com/CCX/B539" ext-link-type="uri">https://links.lww.com/CCX/B539</ext-link>). Additional variables included the number of PT sessions during hospitalization, the number of PT sessions while on ECMO, and complications that occurred during those sessions. The frequency of PT sessions was calculated to understand the longitudinal PT exposure for each patient. The number of PT sessions on or after ECMO was divided by the number of days from ECMO cannulation to hospital discharge. Patients were then grouped by frequency of PT, which correlated with days between PT sessions (high &lt; 3 d, moderate 3&#8211;7 d, and low &gt; 7 d). If a patient did not receive PT, their frequency was calculated based on the number of days from cannulation to discharge. Therefore, a patient who did not receive PT and had a time from cannulation to discharge of 30 days would have a frequency of 30, placing them in the low-frequency group.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome of this study was functional status at discharge as measured by the Boston University &#8220;6-Clicks&#8221; AM-PAC Basic Mobility short form (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This was dichotomized into greater than or equal to 18 or less than 18 to separate patients who could independently walk at least ten steps at discharge (<bold>Fig. S2.1</bold>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://links.lww.com/CCX/B539" ext-link-type="uri">https://links.lww.com/CCX/B539</ext-link>). Outcomes included survival to hospital discharge and discharge destination. Safety data was collected to include complications that occurred during each PT session.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Extraction</title><p>Trained reviewers extracted patient data from the medical record using a standard extraction guide and data dictionary. After initial data extraction, a random sample of charts was subsequently checked for accuracy by a second reviewer. A third reviewer corrected any discrepancies for data integrity. Data encompassed clinical interventions, ECMO type, ICU interventions, mechanical circulatory support device (Balloon pump or Impella device), diagnoses, number of PT sessions, AM-PAC score before ECMO, first AM-PAC score on ECMO, last AM-PAC score on ECMO, initial AM-PAC score after decannulation, final in-patient AM-PAC score, reason for ECMO discontinuation, discharge disposition, level of therapy needed at discharge, and in-hospital mortality. Cannulation site data and etiology of illness leading to ECMO support were only available for patients supported with venovenous ECMO. Etiologies of venoarterial ECMO were not available due to limitations with the local registry data.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>Summary statistics were calculated using medians and proportions. Group comparisons were completed by Mann-Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic>, Fisher exact, or chi-square tests, as appropriate. To address confounding by illness severity, only the population that survived to hospital discharge was used for modeling. A logistic Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model with ten-fold cross-validation was used to understand which factors affect a patient&#8217;s functional status at discharge. The outcome for the model was an AM-PAC greater than or equal to 18 or an AM-PAC less than 18 to align with a patient being safe for discharge home. Briefly, LASSO regression seeks to find the most parsimonious model by selecting only those variables that contribute the most to the model&#8217;s performance, which is beneficial for datasets with large numbers of variables. Before cross-validation, the data were divided 80/20 into a derivation and validation cohort, with the outcome of interest being equally divided between the two cohorts. Penalty values for the LASSO regression were chosen after tuning the model with a grid of possible penalty values. The penalty value was then optimized to allow for the smallest model with negligible change in model performance. A final multivariable logistic model was created using the results of the LASSO regression and expert consensus for final variable selection. All included variables were checked for collinearity and interactions. Ordinal logistic regression was also attempted, but the proportional odds assumption was violated, so that method was not used.

Specific ECMO-related complications occurred in six (1%, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6/579) of all ECMO sessions and only one session had to be stopped due to changes in ECMO flow. These complications were due to minor, manageable ECMO flow changes and were not clinically significant. Patient falls or injuries did not occur in any PT sessions.

Additionally, modeling showed an association with PT on ECMO and increased odds of being discharged with an AM-PAC score greater than or equal to 18.</p><p>Our results expand those in a recent systematic review by Rivera et al. (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) examining the benefits, risks and efficacy of physical rehabilitation and/or mobilization in patients on ECMO. Our study offers more granular data on mobilization protocols and the functional status of patients studied. Additionally, it provides information regarding site-specific ECMO volume, rehabilitation team infrastructure, and patient-specific outcomes such as functional status and discharge destination. Consistent with other comparably designed studies, ours showed an association between PT interventions, including exercise, mobility, and ambulation, both during and after ECMO, and improved functional status at discharge. Associations with improved survival rates were additionally identified, as noted in prior work (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Other protocols addressing patient candidacy for PT on ECMO vary significantly in their criteria. Often in other published protocols, only 50% of patients or fewer will meet criteria to initiate a PT evaluation (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Within our cohort, AM-PAC scores increased from initial to final assessment in all frequency subgroups; however, the highest rate of change was noted in the high- and medium-frequency PT groups. Those in the high-frequency PT intervention group were more frequently patients on ECMO as a bridge to treatment (BTT; transplant, or other treatment strategy such as surgical left ventricular assist device [LVAD]) and furthermore, were more likely to participate in PT while on ECMO. Although a bias in referral is possible (i.e., patients potentially needing a transplant or LVAD were increasingly likely to be referred to PT for mandatory preoperative conditioning and optimization), it could be that these same patients may have been relatively more stable compared with those who did not meet criteria for BTT based on severity of illness. Only six patients out of the 86 discharged alive in this study were classified as BTT. To avoid referral biases, some ECMO centers have reported an automatic consult placed on day 2 of ECMO support to ensure chart review and team discussion to avoid overlooking patients who may be candidates for PT intervention (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>In terms of safety, no PT sessions on ECMO had clinically significant and/or serious complications, and only one session-required cessation of the PT session due to ECMO flow changes. Our findings are broadly consistent with adverse event reports in similar studies, which quote occurrence in 0&#8211;0.001% of sessions (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Overall, major events discussed in other studies include stroke, pulmonary embolism, arrhythmias (0.5&#8211;5%), tachypnea (3%) and limited distal reperfusion cannula bleeding (0.05&#8211;20%) (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The most common complication in our cohort was bradyarrhythmias, the predominance of which occurred in one individual until undergoing pacemaker placement. Overall, this is yet another demonstration of the safety and feasibility of assertive and functionally impactful PT. In preparation for mobilization, several steps were taken to ensure safety, including catheter grip devices, suture placement, and cannula position checks before and after each session; as well as the participation of a multidisciplinary team including a physical therapist, nurse, and perfusionist or ECMO specialist (S1.1&#8211;S1.4, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://links.lww.com/CCX/B539" ext-link-type="uri">https://links.lww.com/CCX/B539</ext-link>). Complications associated with ECMO mobility are inconsistently documented in the literature; however, the complications reported here provide a clear understanding of the limited risks that occur during closely monitored patient mobilization while on ECMO.</p><p>PT session frequency was also associated with survival, but these results should be interpreted cautiously. Meeting candidacy for initiation of PT and factors, such as severity of illness, limiting sedation, or exposure to paralytics, could play a significant role in improving survival beyond PT. While our study did not look specifically at patient sedation, the impact of prolonged sedation on increased rates of ICU-AW cannot be overstated. Similarly, deconditioning due to the duration of immobility, inadequate nutrition, and the neuromuscular effects of sedation and NMB, should be appreciated (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although early rehabilitation has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in critically ill patients with various diagnoses, venovenous ECMO is frequently used in conditions like severe ARDS, where mobility is limited due to the inability to wean analgosedation or remove NMB usage (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Allowing patients with conditions like severe ARDS to participate in PT is a major benefit of ECMO by limiting the known deleterious effects of typical treatments.</p><p>This study is limited by being from a single center and its retrospective design. The inability to directly control for and define illness severity as it relates to functionality presents a challenge in that there exists a spectrum of critical illness that may or may not significantly impact a patient&#8217;s ability to participate in PT. Presumably, healthier patients are more likely to meet the criteria for and consistently participate in PT. This, in turn, can limit the ability to evaluate the influence of PT on long-term outcomes. Within the limitations of our study, we attempted to account for this by excluding patients in our cohort who did not survive or remain on ECMO for less than 3 days. Furthermore, we only performed outcome modeling and analysis in patients who survived to hospital discharge. This attempts to address the problem of confounding by illness severity. Although this study was conducted at a single center, which limits its generalizability, it took place at a high-volume, tertiary ECMO referral center with a large catchment area. This enabled the collection of enough data for meaningful insights.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The mobilization of critically ill patients on ECMO is both safe and feasible, but it necessitates a team with expertise and adequate resources. In our study, there was an association with patients who participated in PT at moderate to high frequencies, and those who participated in PT while on ECMO, with improved functional outcomes at hospital discharge.</p><p>While our research adds to the growing literature supporting the feasibility and benefits of PT at moderate to high frequencies, further investigation is essential to establish a more causal link, inclusion criteria, therapy regimens, and effects on outcomes. Future research should include prospective trials that assess survival rates, length of stay, discharge destinations, functional mobility, quality of life, and longitudinal factors such as productivity in survivors.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The described work performed would not be possible without the efforts and dedication of our multidisciplinary care team consisting of registered nurses, perfusionists, respiratory, occupational, and physical therapists, advanced practice providers, trainees, physicians, and surgeons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><fig id="s001" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="cc9-7-e1307-s001.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></fig></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Presented, in part, at the annual meeting of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, Orlando, FL, February 23-25, 2025.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Support was provided internally by the Emory Department of Anesthesiology.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have disclosed that they do not have any potential conflicts of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Reporting guidelines used: Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected health Data.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>Supplemental digital content is available for this article.
