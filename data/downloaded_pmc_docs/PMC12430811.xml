The incidence of EC has been rising in recent years owing to high caloric diets and low physical activity<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The majority of ECs are confined to the uterus and therefore have favorable prognoses<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Comprehensive surgical staging (i.e., total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and lymph node assessment) is the primary treatment for EC that is confined to the uterus<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. The surgical approach has evolved from open to laparoscopic and finally to robotic surgery<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. The da Vinci surgical robotic system is the most widely used robot-assisted surgical platform worldwide; it offers great advantages for gynecological surgeries such as hysterectomy/radical hysterectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, sacrovaginal fixation, and others<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. However, the high cost of the da Vinci system has hindered its adoption rate, especially in developing countries. To that end, several competing platforms have been developed, including the Zeus<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, TelelapALF-X<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, and MicroHandS systems<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. In China, the recently introduced KangDuo Surgical Robot-01 (KD-SR-01, KangDuo Robot, Ltd.) has already been used in urological<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> and colorectal surgeries<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. However, its application in gynecological surgeries has not yet been explored. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the KD-SR-01 by comparing the short-term outcomes of patients who underwent surgical staging for EC using this system to those who underwent the same procedure using the da Vinci Xi system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study (KD2022-002-CSR) was a multicenter, randomized, unblinded, parallel-controlled, noninferiority trial conducted between May 2022 and June 2023 at four institutions: Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing Hospital, and The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) serious uncontrolled diseases or acute infections; (2) cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, hematological, or immune system diseases or diabetes that could not be controlled to meet surgical standards; (3) high-grade (G3), serous carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, or carcinosarcoma confirmed via histology of an endometrial biopsy sample; (4) deep myometrial invasion detected on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging; (5) positive pelvic lymph nodes on imaging (short diameter &#8805;1.5 cm on magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography or a standardized uptake value &#8805;2.5 on positron emission tomography/computed tomography; (6) poor vaginal condition (i.e., the uterus could not be removed intact through the vagina as determined by the surgeon); (7) severe pelvic/abdominal adhesions that preclude laparoscopic surgery; and (8) had undergone clinical trials of other investigational drugs or devices that were not yet complete (Supplemental Digital Content 1, Protocol, available at: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/JS9/E384" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/JS9/E384</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Preoperative preparation</title><p>All participants underwent necessary preoperative examinations and were informed of the surgical merit, demerits, and any emergency measures that may be taken during surgery. All surgeons participating in the study were required to have &gt;5&#160;years of endoscopic surgery experience and &gt;1 year of robotic surgery experience; they were adequately trained in robotic surgical techniques and consented to be closely monitored by the project supervisor during the operation.</p><p>Block randomization with a block size of 4 was employed in the study, along with stratification by center, to minimize potential confounding factors. The statistical team, which did not participate in the screening and inclusion of participants, generated a random coding table using the SAS 9.4 software. To determine groupings (of which the researchers were not aware in advance), these randomized assignments were printed and sealed in an opaque envelope. After the participants signed their informed consent forms, the investigator opened the envelope according to the random number sequence printed on each; this action was logged with a time and signature. Patients in the study and control groups underwent surgeries using the KD-SR-01 and da Vinci Xi instruments, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>There are several key differences between the KangDuo Surgical Robot-01 (KD-SR-01) and the da Vinci surgical system<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. The KD-SR-01 features an open console system, which facilitates better communication among the surgical team, enhances hand-eye coordination, and reduces eye strain and neck fatigue. Additionally, multiple observers, including trainees, can utilize the three-dimensional vision system to observe the procedure. The KD-SR-01 is also highly compatible with various three-dimensional laparoscopic systems and energy devices, with potential for future expansions. Unlike the da Vinci Xi system, the KD-SR-01 is equipped with three robotic arms, including two instrument arms and one camera arm. However, it is priced at approximately half the cost of the da Vinci Xi system.</p><p>The patients underwent general anesthesia, routine disinfection, towel laying, and catheterization. Next, pneumoperitoneum was established using carbon dioxide, and trocars were then inserted (Supplemental Digital Content 2, Figure 1, available at: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/JS9/E385" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/JS9/E385</ext-link>). Patients were placed in a lithotomy-Trendelenburg position, then the robot was docked between the legs (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The basic procedures of docking the robot were similar to those published previously<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.<fig position="float" id="F2" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Location of the surgeon relative to the console.

</p><p>At the beginning of surgery, peritoneal fluid or washings were collected, and the fallopian tubes were coagulated and blocked. A uterine manipulator was inserted, then both infundibulopelvic or proper ovary ligaments were ligated and cut; the pelvic lymph nodes from the external iliac, internal iliac, obturator, and common iliac regions were also dissected. The round ligaments were cut to allow for peritoneal retraction and downward pushing of the bladder; the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments were then severed. Next, the vault of the vagina was circumcised, and the uterus was removed through it; the vaginal cuff was then fully rinsed and closed laparoscopically. A drainage tube was placed when necessary at the discretion of the surgeons. The pneumoperitoneum was emptied, and the incisions were closed (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). All videos and images captured during the procedure were preserved for review. Adverse events were monitored and recorded throughout the entire process of the clinical trial.<fig position="float" id="F3" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Surgical steps using the KangDuo Surgical Robot-01.

</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>Baseline demographic data including age, body mass index, history of surgery, gravidity, parity, menopausal status, and stage according to the 2009 International Federation of Gynecological Oncology guidelines were collected for all participants. The primary endpoint was the surgical success rate, which was defined as the ability to complete the surgery as per the predetermined plan, without the need to switch to alternative surgical methods, including conventional laparoscopic surgery and open surgery, and without the need for a second surgery within 24&#160;hours postoperatively as a result of surgical complications. The secondary endpoints included the number of harvested lymph nodes and surgical satisfaction, which encompassed assessment of National Aeronautics and Space Administration task load index (NASA-TLX) and intraoperative operation feelings score. The safety evaluation endpoints encompassed the docking time, console time, intraoperative blood loss (which was calculated by determining the total volume of suctioned fluids, minus the volume of irrigation fluids used at the completion of surgery), intraoperative blood transfusion; drainage volume, retention time of the drainage catheter, and postoperative complications (which were assessed and graded using the Clavien&#8211;Dindo classification). The docking time was defined as the interval between the initial movement of the robotic arm flat car toward the operating table and the end of the docking between the last puncture sheath tube and the corresponding arm. The console time was defined as the duration between robot docking and its detachment.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics analysis</title><p>Previous data obtained under similar circumstances have suggested the effectiveness rate for each group ought to reach 98%.

Although other surgical approaches, both vaginal and abdominal, may also be reasonable choices for certain patients, procedures performed via minimally invasive surgery (i.e., laparoscopy) have emerged as the standard of care for patients with early-stage EC owing to a lower rate of wound-related complications, lower blood loss, and shorter hospital stays without compromising oncological outcomes<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Intraoperative surgical tasks include grasping, traction, dissection, coagulation, ligation, cutting, and suturing; all such activities require both high expertise and several types of surgical instruments. Owing to a high rate of comorbid obesity and metabolic syndrome in patients with EC, it is challenging to achieve optimal surgical field exposure in a narrow pelvic cavity<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, the long, straight, and unbendable arms of laparoscopic surgery instruments may also cause inconveniences during suturing or lymph node dissection. The da Vinci Xi system, which was developed by Intuitive Surgical, Inc. in 1998 and approved by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical use in 2000, has a high-definition magnified three-dimensional field of view and a flexible robotic arm with seven degrees of freedom. Thus, it can completely replicate or even partially surpass the activities of human hands and wrists with a shorter learning curve. Previous studies have shown that the learning curve for da Vinci robotic surgery for gynecological purposes is shorter than that for traditional laparoscopic surgery<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. Bogani <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> demonstrated that robot-assisted surgery for EC staging had significantly fewer complications, lower chances of readmission, and shorter hospital stays<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. In China, where the application of robotic surgery is limited by economic factors, several robotic systems have been developed for use in urologic<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> and colorectal surgeries<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. To our knowledge, our study is one of the largest randomized controlled trials to demonstrate the noninferiority of a novel robotic system to the da Vinci Xi in gynecologic surgery.</p><p>All operations were completed successfully without converting to open surgery or another laparoscopic procedure. No significant differences were noted in the majority of secondary endpoints including number of harvested lymph nodes, NASA-TLX score (mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, and effort), operation feeling score, console time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, or others. These data suggest that the efficacy and safety of the KD-SR-01 and da Vinci Xi systems are comparable in terms of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgical staging for EC after sufficient training.</p><p>The exploratory learning curve analysis at center 01 revealed that while console and docking times for the da Vinci system remained consistent, those for the KD-SR-01 decreased. The threshold for proficiency was reached at cases 10-11, suggesting that surgeons with expertise in laparoscopic surgery for gynecologic oncology and da Vinci robotic surgery can become proficient with the KD system after performing 11 cases. With adequate training, the performance gap between the KD-SR-01 and the da Vinci Xi systems is expected to narrow. Due to the limited number of KD robotic surgeries (&lt;10 cases) at the other three centers, similar analyses could not be performed. It is important to note that trends observed in the single center require further validation in multi-center studies with larger cohorts.</p><p>Additional advantages to the KD-SR-01 system were noted. First, the open console design promotes a natural neck posture, helping to alleviate neck pain and stress, thus offering an ergonomic advantage over the da Vinci Xi platform<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>. Surgeons reported high levels of comfort with the KD-SR-01 system, indicating its great potential to improve the work environment and enhance both efficiency and safety. Second, the KD-SR-01 system is expected to have a lower cost. As more surgical robotic systems are developed and introduced to the market, increased competition will drive technological advancements and further reduce prices. In 2024, the average prices of the KD-SR-01 and da Vinci Xi in China are approximately $1.6 million and $3.6 million, respectively. Third, the KD-SR-01 system offers high compatibility, supporting a wide range of high-definition and ultra-high-definition cameras, indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging systems, and energy instruments. This flexibility allows surgeons to perform procedures with greater precision. Fourth, the KD system has also begun exploring long-distance operations based on 5&#160;G technology<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, for teams with limited budgets, or those prioritizing high instrument compatibility and ergonomic advantages, the KD system represents a viable alternative.</p><p>The KD group showed a longer docking time as well as higher NASA-TLX scores (for performance and frustration). This could be attributed to the surgeons&#8217; greater experience with the da Vinci Xi system, as the surgical team might have felt more stressed when using a new platform. However, the differences were relatively small (about 1 minute in docking time and 0.57&#8211;0.86 in NASA-TLX score), indicating that the impact on clinical practice would be modest.</p><p>The da Vinci Xi system integrates an ICG imaging system, which facilitates the recognition of lymphatic drainage pathways through ICG injection at the subserosa. This capability has been demonstrated in rectal surgery for lateral lymph node dissection and in the treatment of endometrial cancers, leading to an increased lymph node yield<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>. As this is the first trial to validate the efficacy and safety of the KD surgical robot in staging surgery for endometrial cancer, we focused on pelvic lymph node dissection and did not perform sentinel lymph node mapping. In subsequent clinical trials, we have specifically validated sentinel lymph node mapping and dissection.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, 6-week follow-up is insufficient to fully assess surgical complications, and oncological outcomes were not included as endpoints, thus a longer follow-up period would be required to assess long-term safety. Second, both systems lack tactile feedback, which limits their applications in complex surgical operations<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>. Finally, sentinel lymph node biopsy, which is increasingly performed and is now standard for surgical staging for low-risk EC, was not performed using the KD-SR-01 system. This limits the generalizability to contemporary practice.</p><p>In conclusion, the KD-SR-01 system is safe and effective for laparoscopic surgical staging of EC, and its short-term results are comparable to those of the da Vinci Xi system after sufficient training.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Chen Yao (Department of Medical Statistics, Peking University First Hospital) for statistical consultation.
