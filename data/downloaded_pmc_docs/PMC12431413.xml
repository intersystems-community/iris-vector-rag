This study aimed to evaluate the impact of shade provision on the water intake and drinking behaviour of Nellore steers (<italic toggle="yes">Bos indicus</italic>) in a tropical feedlot environment. A total of 47 steers (~450&#8201;kg body weight) were allocated into two groups: one with access to shade (+S) and another without (-S). Individual water intake, drinking behaviour (e.g., frequency, daily patters), and animal performance were monitored over 83 days using automated recording systems. Results showed that -S steers consumed 8% more water per day (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001), made more frequent visits to the water trough (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001), but drank less per visit (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001) and overall spend 39% more time per day drinking (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001) compared to the&#8201;+&#8201;S steers. Despite these differences in drinking behaviour, average daily gain and feed intake did not differ between groups (p&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.05). Environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and solar radiation affected water intake in both groups. Higher air temperatures increased water intake by boosting drinking frequency, while higher relative humidity reduced water intake by decreasing visit frequency. Shade provision reduced water demand per unit of body weight gain, improving water-use efficiency. These findings suggest that while shade may not directly enhance body weight gain, it can optimise drinking behaviour, reduce water intake, and improve animal welfare in tropical beef production systems.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordena&#195;&#167;&#195;&#163;o de Aperfei&#195;&#167;oamento de Pessoal de N&#195;vel Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Pascale Palhares</surname><given-names>Julio C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Biotechnological and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></funding-source><award-id>S2N; BBS/E/C/000I0320</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Biotechnological and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></funding-source><award-id>BB/X010953/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9045-289X</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Rivero</surname><given-names>M.

Heat stress in cattle causes decreases in feed intake, growth, and efficiency, and threats animal health and welfare. In extreme cases, heat stress can cause death of vulnerable animals [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Feedlot cattle are susceptible to heat stress, which can negatively impact their performance and overall wellbeing. This issue is particularly prevalent in tropical climates, where high temperatures can lead to reduced feed intake and increased respiratory rates due to elevated thermal loads [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nearly half of the world&#8217;s beef production comes from tropical and subtropical regions, and the implementation&#160;of best management practices for sustainable resource management is of global significance [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Cattle use evaporative cooling to dissipate heat load. However, this process increases their need to consume water to maintain homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], therefore increasing the demand for water of the production systems. Shade reduces heat load and the need for evaporative cooling and water replenishment [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Artificial shade is in the forefront of environmental modifications to mitigate the negative impacts of heat stress and to improve welfare of beef cattle [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], particularly in tropical environments [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. With increasing heat stress, cattle exhibit more changes in physiology and behavioural strategies related to heat dissipation, leading to greater competition for shade and water [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, heat stress affects not only water intake (WI) and access to shade but also drinking behaviour (e.g., number of visits to the water troughs) and daily WI patterns. For instance, cattle without access to shade spend more time near water troughs and visit them more frequently, increasing antagonistic interactions and reducing the time spent on more productive activities, such as ruminating or resting, compared to animals with shade access [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Factors influencing drinking behaviour include water source and availability, water quality, and environmental conditions. Drinking behaviour can, in turn, impact animal performance and WI as well as animal welfare; understanding the relationships among these factors is essential for designing water systems for grazing and feedlot cattle [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, there is little agreement in the literature regarding the main drivers of WI and, consequently, drinking behaviour. It was hypothesised that access to shade would reduce WI under tropical conditions and modify the drinking behaviour and daily drinking patterns of feedlot cattle, and that these changes would be driven by weather conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the effects of access to shade versus no access to shade of <italic toggle="yes">Bos indicus</italic> steers in a feedlot located in tropical conditions on daily WI and patterns, drinking behaviour and animal performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The spring season experiment took place from September 2019 to December 2019 at the Experimental Feedlot of Embrapa Southeast Livestock in Sao Carlos, Sao Paulo, Brazil (21&#176; 57&#8242; 42&#8243; S, 47&#176; 50&#8242; 28&#8243; W, 860 m height above mean sea level).

Additionally, WI was expressed per kg ADG (L/kg ADG), in litres consumed as a percentage of BW, and per kg DMI (L/kg DM).

Data on animal performance and WI variables were analysed using paired Wilcox signed rank tests that compared the mean values for a variable (e.g., WI) of each group on each day. A zero-inflated Poisson model was used to assess the effects of time of day, treatment group, and their interaction on hourly WI, accounting for excess zeroes in the data.

Those with shade drank less frequently but drank more per visit, than those without shade. The combined effect was that cattle with shade drank less per day than those without. These results highlight how environmental modifications can impact the thermoregulatory strategies of cattle and may inform management strategies for heat stress. Whilst these results are broadly consistent with the literature, one novel finding was that cattle with shade typically loaded with water earlier in the day, whilst those without drank at a more consistent rate. Despite being exposed to warm conditions, with the majority of days experiencing a THI above 70 (even at nighttime), and an average BGT about 3 &#176;C above the DBT, the animals grew at a good rate, comparable to values reported for Nellore cattle in feedlots under similar conditions [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and with similar DMI levels when expressed as a percentage of BW [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This finding aligns with other research that suggests shade may not always impact growth performance, even though it reduces WI [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The lack of differences in DMI and ADG between the groups in our study could be attributed to the fact that drinking water was sufficient for thermoregulation, allowing the animals to maintain feed intake and growth rates despite the differences in heat stress levels. Additionally, it has been reported that Nellore cattle have the ability to adjust their body metabolism to the adverse environmental conditions during the day, especially in the semi-arid tropical regions [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The differences in drinking behaviour may be attributed to heat load. Shade reduces heat load and the need for evaporative cooling and water replenishment [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our results are consistent with the literature [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], indicating that shade plays a vital role in reducing water demand. Daily WI reported in our study (35.1&#8201;L/d [6.8% BW] for +S and 37.9&#8201;L/d [7.3% BW] for -S) were broadly consistent with literature on Nellore cattle; for example, Zanetti et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported an intake of 6.5% BW for 299-kg animals. Animals in +S had two options to use their environment to thermoregulate, i.e., water ingestion or use of shaded area; however, animals in -S only had access to water. Thermoregulation through shade use is likely the primary strategy when SR significantly contributes to heat stress, reducing the need for thermoregulation by WI.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Drinking behaviour and daily patterns</title><p>Feedlot cattle most actively drink between 0600 and 2100&#8201;h [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which agrees with our findings. When cattle have access to shade they remain there during the hottest hours of the day, leaving shade only when looking for water or at the end of the day. In our study, shaded animals exhibited distinct drinking patterns, consuming more water per visit but less frequently, particularly during cooler hours of the day, which aligns with their adaptation to minimise heat stress during peak temperatures. This adaptation can be explained by the lower water search frequency observed in animals with shade, which is also associated with the milder microclimate created by shade [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and a reduced incidence of direct SR. The faster drinking rate of shaded animals could indicate that they prioritised efficiency, drinking more in less time. This behaviour allowed them to optimise time for feeding and resting, reducing exposure to heat, since cattle with access to shade optimise their drinking behaviour, allowing them to spend less time near water sources and more time engaged in productive activities like ruminating [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and grazing, particularly during peak hours than cattle with no access to shade [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These differences in behavioural activities are larger when THI is above the bovine comfort zone over 24&#8201;h [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In our study, the frequency of visits in the peak hours seems not to differ between +S and -S groups, but the amount of water consumed per visit in the morning was greater in the&#8201;+&#8201;S; this could imply that steers with access to shade consumed most of their water outside the peak hours by drinking faster an in fewer occasions to dedicate more time to eat and laydown in the colder hours of the day.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Environmental factors affecting drinking behavior</title><p>As the severity of heat stress increases, cattle exhibit increasingly more changes in physiological and behavioural attributes related to heat dissipation, increasing competition for shade and water to the point where the benefits outweigh the costs [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For instance, time spent drinking increases with THI, but the rate of increase is more than two-fold in animals without access to shade [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Maximum shade utilisation of cattle occurs when levels of SR exceed 800 W/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Applying the probability distribution proposed by Maia et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and considering that, in our study, several days had SR values above 300 W/m<sup>2</sup>, this would imply that around 50% of the animals would look for shade in the morning and around 75% in the afternoon. Rain could be another factor influencing animal behaviour. In our study, the rainy days had an average maximum DBT 3.2 &#176;C lower and a BGT 2.7 &#176;C lower than the days with no rain (see raw data files [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). In rainy days, the animals in -S decreased they daily WI by 9.1&#8201;L/d while the ones in +S decreased it only by 6.4&#8201;L/d, while both groups decreased the number of daily visits to the water troughs by around 1 and increased the visit duration by 30 seconds (see raw data files [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). One potential explanation for this reduced WI and visits could be due to the reduced level of overall activity in rainy days [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Another reason could be the milder temperatures experimented in rainy days. When comparing three days with rain and three days without rain with a similar average BGT (~21.5 &#176;C), we found that the daily WI was similar within the -S and the&#8201;+&#8201;S groups (around 33.4 and 31.3&#8201;L/d, respectively) but with ~0.6 more daily visits on the days with no rain for -S (4.9 v 5.4) and +S (4.2 vs 4.9) (see raw data files [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]), which would support the idea that the rain, in addition to create milder conditions, also reduced the level of activity of the animals. When comparing the three warmest days (BGT&#8201;=&#8201;30.2 &#176;C, no rain) with the three coldest days (BGT&#8201;=&#8201;18.0 &#176;C, rain), animals in -S increased their WI by 18&#8201;L/d, while the ones in +S increased 13.6&#8201;L/d, whereas both groups increased their daily visits by around 1.2 (see raw data files [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). This would suggest that the animals in -S increased their drinking rate in hot days in comparison with those in +S. Water temperature increases linearly with DBT (R<sup>2</sup>&#8201;=&#8201;0.95) [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; thus, warmer water in very hot days may affect drinking behaviour. However, given that the water troughs in our study had a maximum capacity of 50&#8201;L, the water renewal rate was higher than that of traditional water troughs, which resulted in animals having fresher water. Ultimately, WI (both free and in feed) is driven by multiple factors, including BW, ADG, feed characteristics, and environmental conditions, resulting in high variability. Wagner and Engle [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported, for finishing cattle of 544&#8201;kg (median of 551&#8201;kg in our study), a demand of 53.4&#8211;61.3&#8201;L/d (9.8&#8211;11.3% BW) depending on ambient temperature, whilst Lardner et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found yearling steers of 304&#8201;kg to require 42&#8201;L/d (13.8% BW).</p><p>We aimed to disentangle the effect of weather conditions on drinking behaviour by analysing the relationships between these variables. There is little agreement in the literature as to the main drivers of WI; whilst some studies report maximum DBT to be the main factor [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] others report minimum DBT or THI [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], while RH has also been reported as a major contributor to heat stress in hot climates [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our results agree with the former, with maximum DBT strongly correlating to daily WI. Considering that maximum DBT values tend to increase due to global warming [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], this result is important for water planning in cattle feedlots. With regards to RH, whilst we found that is positively correlated with water consumed per visit, the negative relationship it had with the number of visits per day was strong enough that RH had a net negative relationship with overall daily WI.</p><p>In tropical climates, rising RH limits the efficiency of evaporative cooling [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], forcing cattle to drink more water to regulate their body temperature. The low average WS recorded in our study could be classified as a light breeze [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which may have contributed only with a small amount of convection cooling, hence the not significant association with WI or drinking behaviour in our study. This negligible convection cooling potential of the environment due to wind may have increased the need of the animals to dissipate heat through evaporate cooling [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], amplifying the impact of RH in the heat load of the animals and their drinking behaviour, hence the strong correlation between RH and WI and number of visits to the water troughs per day. The overall trend observed over time in the decrease in DBT and the increase in RH would then contribute to explain the overall trend of decreasing the number of visits to the water troughs, the increase in the amount of water consumed per visit and the decrease in the mean daily WI observed as the finishing feedlot phase progressed.</p><p>Exposure to SR can increase body temperature, which can lead to increases in daily WI to help regulate body temperature [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Consequently, in our study, daily WI increased as SR increased, and, interestingly, steers drank more water per visit as the maximum SR increased. Unexpectedly, THI and maximum THI were not associated with the drinking behaviour (visits per day or water consumed per visit) in our study. Souza et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] found strong correlation between THI and daily WI in hot climate, with THI ranging from 74 to 86, whereas in our study average THI ranged from 61.9 to 78.4. This would suggest that the effect of the THI would be relevant in warm conditions, as shown by the significant correlation of the maximum THI on the amount of water consumed per visit. Interestingly, rain appears as a not important variable to model daily WI [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This contrasts with our findings since rainfall was negatively correlated with daily WI, mainly driven by the number of visits.</p><p>WI is likely circumstantial and unique to each production system. Because of this, attempts at modelling water demand have had limited success due to the complexity of its drivers, rarely being able to explain much more than 50% of its variance [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, such attempts have overwhelmingly focussed on <italic toggle="yes">Bos taurus</italic>. A key distinction to be made in this field is between <italic toggle="yes">B. taurus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. indicus</italic>, with the latter subspecies generally being better adapted to tropical and arid environments [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Consequently, Nellore cattle have relatively good thermal tolerance up until ~35&#176;C [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our study, animal performance was not affected by access to shade under the environmental conditions, but WI and drinking behaviour were clearly affected, suggesting that the animals needed to display some behavioural changes to cope with hot days. Heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense in tropical regions due to global warming. This may affect not only the drinking behaviour of animals but also their performance. Therefore, studies like this should continue in the face of more adverse climate conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Variability in water intake and drinking behaviour</title><p>The substantial individual variability in WI and water-use efficiency among cattle cannot be explained by current models [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Some animals have been shown to be more water-efficient, requiring less water per kilogram of BW gained, a trait that is genetically correlated with improved growth performance [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Palhares et al. [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] detected the influence of animal performance and productivity on daily WI. This information should be used to propose best practices and support beef systems in regions affected by climate change and water scarcity. In our study, the three top animals ranked by their WI to ADG ratio were 41.7% more efficient (i.e., required less water per kg BW gained) within the&#8201;+&#8201;S and 53.8% more efficient within the -S groups (see raw data files [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) than the three bottom-ranked animals, highlighting the notable individual variability in terms of WI and water use efficiency.</p><p>The individual variability can also be explained by the animal-to-animal interactions. Grazing non-lactating dairy cows with the water trough located in the corridor, i.e., with a certain level of restriction of the resource given the distance from the paddock (150 m), showed a greater number of visits per day and time spent drinking for dominant cows in comparison to subordinate cows [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It has been stated that dominance rank in groups of animals may result in a few top-ranking individuals getting plenty and the rest little resources, or the majority getting equal distribution and the lowest ranking animals getting very little [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In our study, the variables time spent drinking and visit duration in the -S group had the most variability. This would suggest that social hierarchy may have influenced the use of the limited resource (i.e., the only water trough in the pen) at the peak use times causing difference in the time the steers could spent in the water troughs, where dominant animals made greater use of the resource. The size of the shade was enough to cover all the animals in the pen, so hierarchy of the group would not have affected the use of shade.</p><p>Nevertheless, cattle are gregarious and, as such, synchronise their activities [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which may partially explain the daily pattern and variability in water troughs use. It could be inferred that the animals in -S moved to the water troughs on hot days when the heat stress risk was lower, concentrating the drinking events is fewer hours than those in +S, increasing the dominance of high-ranked animals and increasing variability in drinking behaviours between animals. Additionally, the proximity to the water troughs could itself promote WI, contributing to explain even further the higher WI when shade was not available.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Practical implication of providing shade to feedlot cattle</title><p>The findings of this study emphasise the importance of providing shade as a welfare intervention for cattle in tropical environments [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. While shade may not consistently improve cattle performance, it effectively reduces the radiant heat load, lowering body-surface and subcutaneous temperatures, respiration rates, and overall WI [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For instance, steers in +S showed a reduction of approximately 12 litres in daily WI during the hottest days compared to the coldest (see raw data files [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Beyond physiological benefits, shaded environments enhance cattle comfort, reducing heat stress and improving overall welfare, making shade a practical solution in tropical climates [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the design of shaded areas must be carefully considered to avoid resource disputes [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Selective shading for heat-sensitive breeds can optimise costs and enhance welfare, with studies indicating potential payback within four feeding cycles through improved carcass weights [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These findings suggest that, despite the upfront cost of providing shade, the long-term benefits, such as water savings, improved performance, and enhanced animal welfare, make it a worthwhile investment [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, while initial expenses are involved, shade provision offer sustained advantages, with tree planting additionally supporting nutrition, biodiversity, and carbon storage.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The presented study is limited in that the experimental unit within this study was the individual animal, however, individuals were penned in groups. Therefore, it is not possible to entirely rule out group level effects in this study, particularly as cattle are herd animals that do not behave entirely independently of their herd. The issue of pseudoreplication is relatively common across the field of animal science [<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0331238.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and results should be interpreted with consideration of that. Another limiting aspect is that it cannot fully represent the wide variety of factors that potentially impact WI. It also only represents a snapshot of these animals&#8217; lives. When considering a greater range and extreme of variables, or studying an animal&#8217;s entire life, the extent and nature of trends observed are likely to differ, one way or another, from those presented here. A key future area of research would be to analyse the long-term effects of shade provision on cattle performance. This could include the additions of mapping shade availability (based on sun position) at a landscape level, cross-referenced with GPS cattle movement data, WI data, weather measurements, and animal health and performance metrics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study advances the field by providing novel data on the drinking behaviour and individual intake responses of confined beef cattle to artificial shading under tropical conditions, offering incremental yet critical insights into practical management strategies that enhance animal welfare and productivity in the face of escalating climate challenges. This study demonstrates the substantial impact of environmental factors, particularly shade provision, on the drinking behaviour and thermoregulation strategies of Nellore steers in tropical feedlots. Access to shade altered water intake patterns, allowing steers to drink less frequently but more efficiently per visit, ultimately reducing overall water intake. The findings suggest that cattle with shade adapt by prioritising water intake during cooler times of the day, supporting the idea that shaded environments can effectively help manage heat stress.</p><p>Despite variations in drinking behaviour, growth rates and dry matter intake remained similar between shaded and unshaded cattle, evidencing that even under conditions of moderate heat stress Nellore cattle can maintain growth performance without additional cooling interventions. However, the results indicate that while shade did not directly affect growth performance in this study, it served as an essential tool for reducing water intake needs and supporting thermoregulation through behavioural adaptations, which aligns with previous research on the resilience of <italic toggle="yes">B. indicus</italic> breeds in warmer climates.</p></sec><sec id="sec017" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0331238.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supplement A.

</p><p>Reviewer&#8217;s comments (R)</p><p>Authors&#8217; response (A)</p><p>R: The authors describe drinking behaviour of beef cattle with/without shade availability, a topic that has not been well researched despite close links with welfare and, therefore, is of high importance considering rising temperatures due to global warming. The article is in general well written.</p><p>A: Thank you for your valuable comments and time dedicated to review our manuscript. We have addressed all your comments. A clean version of the revised version highlights the changes in blue text.</p><p>R: However, there is a lack of consistency in wording that needs to be addressed and authors provide only n=2 per group which is a very small sample size. In many cases it is unclear if values are calculated per pen or per animal, this must be more transparent.</p><p>A: Values are calculated per individual animal. Text has been added to clarify the RFID tags were uses to track individual cattle.</p><p>R: It is described that in heat animals start to play with water instead of drinking &#8211; how did you ensure to measure intake or consumption?</p><p>A: Individual water intake was measured using the Intergado&#8482; System (Intergado Ltd., Contagem, Minas Gerais, Brazil), which employs RFID technology to track individual cattle and water flow meters installed in the troughs to precisely record the volume of water consumed during each drinking event. The system logs only the water volume that flows through the trough during a drinking event, as detected by the flow meters, ensuring that non-consumptive interactions, such as splashing or playing with water, are not recorded as intake. Additionally, the water troughs were designed and tailored to beef cattle drinking behaviour, minimizing spillage and supporting accurate measurement water intake.</p><p>R: For me, the dataset is this small, that I suggest changing the original research article into a short communication.</p><p>A: The journal does not specifically take short communications, though it can occasionally be a prefix in the title and may be down to editor discretion here. Given that smaller sample sizes are more prone to Type II errors, the extent to which significant differences and associations have been found in our study is, we believe, relatively convincing, especially given the little research done in this area.

Generally maintain the same phrase (drinking behavior OR water drinking behavior, better drinking behavior; water intake OR water consumption, better water consumption) &#8220;drinking behaviour&#8221; used throughout the manuscript.</p><p>A: We prefer to keep &#8220;water intake&#8221; consistently throughout the document since this is how the response variable (WI) was defined and presented in tables and graphs.</p><p>R: L83 months, not mo.</p><p>A: Changed.</p><p>R: L88 May not an unequal number of animals per group per see affect outcomes as drinking frequencies, behaviors etc ? Did you check your data regarding a potential effect of access per animal?</p><p>A: Group sizes were balanced except for one pen, which had one fewer animal due to an illness after the adaptation period, with no replacement available. While we acknowledge the theoretical possibility that group size differences could affect access to resources and influence drinking behaviours, this was not observed in our study. The water troughs, designed and sized by Intergado Ltd. according to manufacturer specifications for beef cattle, provided adequate capacity and access for all animals in each pen, minimising competition. The Intergado&#8482; System recorded consistent metrics across groups. Statistical analysis of these variables showed no significant differences attributable to the minor variation in group size, confirming that access to the troughs was not restricted and that drinking frequencies and behaviours remained unaffected.</p><p>R: L98 Please provide, if possible, any information of the wells&#180; water quality</p><p>A: There is no information available.</p><p>R: L103 water consumed instead of drunk, please change through the whole document</p><p>A: &#8220;drunk&#8221; replaced throughout the manuscript.</p><p>R: How was water consumption measures? Which devices were used, how were the water trough sized?</p><p>A: In the original manuscript, we briefly mentioned the use of the Intergado&#8482; System (Intergado Ltd., Contagem, Minas Gerais, Brazil) for monitoring individual water intake, as referenced in Chizzotti et al. (2015).</p><p>The Intergado&#8482; System utilises RFID technology to identify individual animals and water flow meters attached to the troughs to measure the volume of water consumed during each drinking event. The troughs were designed and sized by Intergado Ltd. to accommodate the cattle&#8217;s drinking behaviour, ensuring sufficient access and capacity for accurate measurement, though specific dimensions were not detailed in our study as they followed the manufacturer&#8217;s standard specifications for beef cattle. We have included this new information in the manuscript. Similarly, we enhanced the description of the feed intake masurement.</p><p>R: L119 (&#8220;W)</p><p>A: Amended.</p><p>R: Fig 1: Provide the size of pens in the figure, it would additionally be desirable to have a picture/sizes of the trough/shade constructions.</p><p>A: As mentioned in the manuscript, each pen is 400 m2. We have added photos of all the relevant features in the pen.</p><p>R: L129 Was normal distribution of variables checked by wilcox rank test? Please specify. Please indicate the packages used, also to illustrate the figures</p><p>A: The Wilcox rank test does not require a normal distribution and thus testing is not necessary. The decision to use non-parametric tests for this was a factor of both sample size and non-normal distributions of variables and the desire for consistency in testing methodologies. Text has been added in this regard. We have also changed the model used for the data to a zero inflated model to better account for the distribution of the data. Citations for R packages added.</p><p>R: L141 ranged from.. to..

Here also use protected spaces before ALL units in the whole document.</p><p>A: Sentence slightly amended. The expression &#8220;spending xx% more time&#8221; means the duration (e.g., in minutes or seconds) was greater by that percentage compared to the other group.</p><p>R: L170 p = 0.053 = 0.05 = significant, no tendency needed here.</p><p>A: We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. The limit for significance is 0.05. Only values up to 0.050 are considered significant. Hence, given that 0.053 &gt; 0.050, this is a trend only.</p><p>R: L174 X and Y correlated positively (r = , p &lt; )</p><p>A: Changed.</p><p>R: L176 delete &#8220;than with shade&#8221;</p><p>A: Done</p><p>R: L177 what means 5-6 fold?</p><p>A: The term "5-6 fold" means an increase of 5 to 6 times the original value (i.e., a multiplication factor of 5 to 6). This phrase is a common scientific shorthand.</p><p>R: L185-193 This information is doubled, as its shown in Fig. 3. However, I understand why mentioning key correlations. You may indicate exact r values at the end of the phrases to provide additional information and/or remove the Fig. in Supplementary File.</p><p>A: Here we are describing the results in terms of correlations (as we do with tables). We agree that the exact r-value should be provided and this has now been added for the significant correlations highlight However, we prefer to maintain the figure in the main document as this provides additional information.

</p><p>I COMMEND THE AUTHORS FOR THE EFFORT IN ADDRESSING THE COMMENTS FROM THE ORIGINAL REVIEWER. UNFORTUNATELY, THE REVIEWER DECLINED TO REVIEW THE REVISED PAPER AND GIVEN MY LACK OF EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA OF RESEARCH I SOUGHT ADDITIONAL REVIEWS FROM TWO INDIVIDUALS WITH THE REQUIRED EXPERTISE. ALTHOUGH ONE FO THE REVIEWERS BELEIVES THERE IS A LACK OF INNOVATIVE ASPECTS IN THE RESEARCH, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IN-AND-OF ITSELF IS A REASON TO REJECT THE PAPER. PLEASE ADDRESS THIS ASPECT BY PROVIDING GREATER CONTEXT AND, PERHAPS, HOW THIS WORK MOVES THE FIELD FORWARD ALBEIT IN AN INCREMENTAL WAY.

This approach is typically used for calculating average daily gain (ADG) when three or more data points are available. Alternatively, consider using the average BW from two consecutive weighing days.</p><p>L96: Were animals fed ad libitum or were they restricted to a specific amount? Please clarify this in the text.</p><p>L98&#8211;100: What was the nutrient composition of the diet? Include a table with detailed dietary composition.</p><p>L104&#8211;106: Please rephrase this sentence for clarity and flow.</p><p>L123&#8211;126 (Fig. 1): Why were the +S pens all located on the same side (east) of the facility? Was there no randomization in pen assignment?</p><p>L136&#8211;137: I strongly disagree with the approach taken here. While individual animal data can be collected for dry matter intake (DMI) and water intake (WI), the pen should be considered the experimental unit when comparing treatments. The shade treatment was applied at the pen level, not at the individual animal level, and thus treatment effects cannot be independently assessed at the animal level.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;I recommend rejection of this manuscript due to a lack of innovation. Although the study was well designed and the statistical analyses are appropriate, the manuscript does not offer any new or relevant insight into the topic under investigation. The discussion is well grounded in the literature, showing that what they have discovered can easily be found in the literature. But overall, I don't believe the work has the level of impact required for publication in this journal.</p><p>As the authors themselves recognize, future studies could explore the long-term effects of shade provision on cattle performance using a more integrated approach. For example, incorporating landscape-level shade mapping (based on sun position), GPS tracking of cattle movements, water intake, weather conditions and animal health and performance metrics would result in a more comprehensive and impactful study. I encourage authors to consider expanding the scope of their research in this direction to strengthen future submissions.</p><p>**********</p><p>--&gt;7.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)--&gt;</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;1: Should environmental variables be considered part of the Results or Methods section? In my opinion, the THI within the pen should be treated as a result, since it was affected by the treatment (shade). However, the other environmental variables (e.g., ambient temperature, rainfall, etc.) should remain in the Methods section, as they are not controlled by the experiment and are more appropriately described as background conditions.</p><p>2: I suggest presenting the diet ingredients and nutrient composition in a separate table rather than in the text.</p><p>3: This is just a general comment for consideration in future studies, no changes to the current manuscript are needed because de explanation is already in the limitations. While I understand and agree that the individual tracking system (feed and water troughs) allowed for the measurement of individual-level responses, I respectfully disagree with the classification of the individual animal as the experimental unit. This issue led to a lengthy discussion "Variability in water intake and drinking behaviour"</p><p>From a statistical and conceptual standpoint, the experimental unit is defined as the smallest unit to which a treatment is applied. In this case, the shade treatment was pen.</p><p>**********</p><p>--&gt;7.
