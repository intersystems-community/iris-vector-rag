However, five participants were excluded from the final analysis. Participants were purposively grouped into hormonal contraceptive users (n&#8201;=&#8201;41), non-hormonal contraceptive users (n&#8201;=&#8201;37), and not on contraceptive (n&#8201;=&#8201;36). After accounting for loss to follow-up, 114 were analysed at baseline and 104 at endline. Contraceptive types included injectables (DMPA), oral pills, and implants (hormonal); and copper IUDs and condoms (non-hormonal). A mid-point (3-month) assessment was conducted for compliance, with the primary body composition outcome measured at six months. Demographic and socioeconomic data were collected using validated structured questionnaires. Body composition was assessed at baseline and six months later using SIDT, with saliva samples analysed to determine total body water (TBW), fat-free mass (FFM), and fat mass (FM).

Hormonal contraceptives are among the most widely used methods of fertility control by women of reproductive age (WRA) globally. As of 2022, approximately 65% of married or partnered women worldwide were using some form of contraception, with hormonal methods such as injectables, implants, and oral pills accounting for nearly half of these [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 28.5% of WRA use modern contraceptives. In Kenya, the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) among married women stands at approximately 58%, with injectables being the most commonly used method [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite this widespread use, the potential nutritional and metabolic effects of hormonal contraceptives, including their impact on body composition, remain under-researched in many low- and middle-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Non-hormonal contraceptive methods&#8212;such as copper intrauterine devices (IUDs), condoms, and fertility awareness methods&#8212;remain in use but are less prevalent in Kenya. Globally, their uptake varies depending on access, cultural acceptability, and individual preference. The implications of contraceptive use on women&#8217;s nutritional and metabolic health are particularly relevant in urbanising populations where rates of overweight and obesity are rising. Excess body fat is a known risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. Kamakwa Ward in Nyeri County was selected for this study due to its semi-urban character, representative of Kenya&#8217;s evolving demographic profile, and the rising burden of NCDs observed within the county.</p><p>Body composition, which includes fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM), is an important indicatorof nutritional status and overall health particularly in women of reproductive age. Hormonal contraceptives, particularly those containing estrogen and progestin, have been linked to changes in body weight, fat distribution, and fluid retention [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite the widespread use of hormonal contraceptives, there is limited research on their impact on body composition, especially in low-resource settings like Kenya.</p><p>This study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the effects of hormonal contraceptives on body composition among WRA in Nyeri County, Kenya, using Stable Isotope Dilution Techniques (SIDT). The SIDT, which involves dosing with deuterium oxide followed by saliva sample analysis, provides a highly accurate and non-invasive means of assessing total body water (TBW), fat-free mass (FFM), and fat mass (FM). This method has been applied in several international studies and is increasingly recognised as a gold standard in body composition analysis, making it suitable for use in resource-limited settings [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While studies have examined hormonal contraceptives&#8217; impact on weight gain, few have utilized SIDT to quantify changes in body composition, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study hypothesised that hormonal contraceptives may influence fat accumulation and water retention independently of other factors such as diet and physical activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design and population</title><p>A total of 119 women were initially recruited. Of these, 114 completed baseline assessment using SIDT, and 104 completed the endline SIDT at six months, resulting in a 9% attrition rate. The study was conducted in Kamakwa ward, Nyeri Central Sub-County in Nyeri County. The County has reported high levels of over nutrition and related health risks such as diabetes which are usually associated with obesity and increased body fat percentage [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Over two thirds of WRA in Nyeri County use the various types of contraceptives (oral, injectable, barrier, and long-term and sterilization contraception methods) [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The Nyeri Town Health Centre and Nyeri Municipal market were used for data collection due to the ease of access by the participants and access to electricity for the data collection tools.</p><p>Participants were categorised into three groups based on contraceptive type: hormonal contraceptive users (n&#8201;=&#8201;41), non-hormonal contraceptive users (n&#8201;=&#8201;37), and not on contraceptives (n&#8201;=&#8201;36). Hormonal methods included injectables (DMPA), combined oral contraceptive pills, and implants, while non-hormonal methods included copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) and male/female condoms. Grouping was done based on the primary mechanism of action&#8212;hormonal vs. barrier or mechanical. Due to sample size constraints, sub-group analyses by individual method were not feasible and thus contraceptives were grouped to allow for statistical power and interpretation. Baseline data were collected, followed by a six-month follow-up to assess changes in body composition. Participants were contacted monthly to monitor contraceptive compliance and side effects. A mid-point (3-month) physical check-in was conducted, but primary outcome data (body composition) were collected at baseline and after six months.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Pre-testing of instruments</title><p>Qualitative and quantitative data collection tools were pretested on 10% of the sample size in Kiganjo ward in Nyeri Central Sub-County, whose residents have similar demographics as those of Kamakwa Ward.

Modifications were implemented to enhance clarity, relevance, and effectiveness.</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Validity.</title><p>The anthropometric tools used in this study adhered to the recommendations by WHO to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between contraceptive type and changes in body fat percentage, adjusting for potential confounders including physical activity (measured by GPAQ), and dietary diversity score (WDDS). The model assumptions were tested for multicollinearity and normality of residuals. with significance set at p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study obtained ethical clearance from the Kenyatta University Ethical Review Committee (PKU2568/I1694) and approval from the Kenyatta University Graduate School. Additionally, a research permit was secured from the National Commission for Science, Technology, and Innovation (NACOSTI)(NACOSTI/P/22/20045). All participants provided written informed consent before participating in the study. They were informed about the study&#8217;s objectives, procedures, potential risks, and benefits. Participants were assured of their right to withdraw from the study at any time without any consequences. Consent forms were available in both English and Kiswahili to ensure comprehension.</p><p>Participant data were treated with strict confidentiality. All personal identifiers were removed, and data were stored securely in password-protected electronic files. Access to the data was restricted to authorized research team members only. Data collection tools were programmed into tablets equipped with the Kobo Collect application, which facilitated secure data transmission to a central server within 24 hours of collection. The study adhered to Ministry of Health and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidelines on COVID-19. Participants and researchers were required to wear masks, maintain social distancing, and use hand sanitizers during data collection.

With a mean age of 26.0 years and nearly half aged between 20&#8211;29 years, the cohort represents women in their peak reproductive years. [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Their distribution across informal and low-income occupations, along with the low prevalence of higher education, underscores the socioeconomic vulnerabilities that may affect access to reproductive health services. These findings highlight the importance of integrating reproductive health education with economic empowerment and vocational training interventions for women in this demographic. [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This income distribution mirrors findings from other studies in Kenya, where low household incomes among women in rural areas are often linked to high levels of poverty and economic insecurity [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The contraceptive use patterns observed align with national trends in Kenya, with high uptake of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) such as IUDs and implants. The 68.3% contraceptive prevalence rate among study participants is encouraging, yet the 31.6% non-use rate signals persistent gaps in uptake [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The study&#8217;s finding that 31.6% of WRA were not using any contraceptive method underscores a persistent gap in contraceptive uptake. This non-use could stem from several factors, including fear of side effects, lack of access, religious or cultural beliefs, or misinformation about contraceptive methods. For example, qualitative studies from Kenya [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and other parts of Africa [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have shown that concerns about side effects, such as weight gain, irregular menstruation, or perceived long-term health risks, are major reasons for non-use of contraception[<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Findings from this study indicate that hormonal contraceptive users experienced a notable increase in body fat percentage and reduction in total body water over the study period. This reduction in TBW may be attributed to the fluid-retentive effects of hormonal contraceptives, particularly those containing estrogen and progestin. Estrogen is known to influence sodium and water retention by modulating renal function and aldosterone activity, which can lead to changes in fluid distribution and electrolyte balance [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similarly, progestins in hormonal contraceptives can affect fluid balance by altering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to increased water retention in tissues [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These findings align with previous studies that have reported similar reductions in TBW among women using combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Hormonal contraceptive users had a significantly higher body fat percentage at endline compared to non-hormonal users and non-contraceptive users. This increase in body fat is consistent with the known effects of hormonal contraceptives on fat metabolism and storage. Progestins, in particular, have been shown to promote adipogenesis (fat cell formation) and inhibit lipolysis (fat breakdown), leading to increased fat deposition [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Additionally, hormonal contraceptives can influence appetite and energy expenditure, further contributing to weight gain and fat accumulation [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This aligns with previous research suggesting that hormonal contraceptives, particularly progestin-based methods, may influence fat deposition and metabolic processes [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The minimal changes observed in non-hormonal users and those not using contraceptives further support the hypothesis that hormonal contraceptives play a direct role in altering body composition. These findings are consistent with studies that have reported weight gain and increased adiposity as common side effects of hormonal contraceptives [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The observed increase in excess body fat among hormonal contraceptive users may have important implications for women&#8217;s health. Excess body fat, particularly central adiposity, is a known risk factor for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. While the current study did not assess the long-term health outcomes associated with these changes, the findings suggest that hormonal contraceptive use may contribute to an increased risk of metabolic complications, particularly among women who are already overweight or obese.</p><p>Notably, users of non-hormonal contraceptives and those not on contraceptives showed no significant changes in body composition, further supporting a causal link to hormonal exposure. Although physical activity was considered and adjusted for as a confounding variable in the regression model, its apparent protective effect in the unadjusted analysis did not remain statistically significant after adjustment. The shift from a non-significant unadjusted odds ratio to a significant adjusted odds ratio for the association between hormonal contraceptive use and increased body fat percentage can be attributed to the control of confounding variables in the multivariable logistic regression model. Adjusting for physical activity and dietary diversity likely reduced the influence of these confounders, which may have obscured the true relationship in the unadjusted analysis. This adjustment isolated the independent effect of hormonal contraceptives, revealing a statistically significant association, possibly due to their biological impact on metabolism and fat distribution. This highlights the strength of hormonal effects on fat accumulation, supporting previous findings from both high- and low-income settings [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For example, studies have shown depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and other progestin-based methods may contribute to increased fat mass through mechanisms involving appetite stimulation and lipid metabolism. Non-hormonal contraceptive methods, on the other hand, showed no significant association with changes in body fat, consistent with their lack of systemic metabolic effects. Dietary diversity also did not appear to meaningfully influence body fat status in this cohort, though it remains an important nutritional consideration overall.</p><p>The influence of hormonal contraceptives on body composition has been widely studied, with mixed findings. Some studies have reported that hormonal contraceptives, particularly progestin-only methods, are associated with weight gain and changes in body composition. For example, Gallo et al., [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] found that women using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) experienced significant increases in body weight and fat mass over a 12-month period. Similarly, Bahamondes et al., [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported that women using DMPA had higher rates of weight gain and increased body fat compared to non-contraceptive users. However, other studies have found no significant association between hormonal contraceptives and changes in body composition. For example, Lopez et al., [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] found no significant differences in body weight or fat mass between women using combined oral contraceptives and non-contraceptive users over a 24-month period. Similarly, [<xref rid="pone.0332299.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] reported that women using DMPA did not experience significant changes in body composition compared to non-contraceptive users.</p><p>This study contributes to the ongoing debate on hormonal contraceptives and body composition by demonstrating significant changes in adiposity and hydration among users&#8212;independent of dietary diversity and physical activity, which were rigorously controlled. By accounting for these key confounders, the findings strengthen the evidence that hormonal contraceptives may directly influence body fat percentage and fluid balance, rather than such changes being driven by lifestyle factors. These results underscore the need to consider contraceptive type in nutritional and metabolic health assessments for women of reproductive age. Additionally, these findings also point to broader public health implications. In regions undergoing rapid urbanisation and dietary transitions, the metabolic side effects of hormonal contraceptives may compound existing vulnerabilities to conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Given the high contraceptive prevalence rate in Kenya and similar low- and middle-income countries, integrating body composition monitoring into family planning services could serve as an early warning system for emerging metabolic risks.</p><sec id="sec024"><title>Delimitation of the study</title><p>This study focussed on examining effects of hormonal contraceptives on the body composition and nutritional status of women of reproductive age residing in Kamakwa Ward of Nyeri Central Sub-County, Nyeri County Kenya. Findings can therefore be generalized only to populations of similar characteristics as the ward in this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>As a cross-sectional study with a six-month follow-up, causal relationships could not be established. Further, the study did not differentiate between specific types of hormonal contraceptives (e.g., oral pills, injectables, implants). While this approach ensured sufficient sample size for statistical comparisons, it may mask variations between specific hormonal formulations (e.g., DMPA vs. oral pills). Future studies with larger samples should consider disaggregating by contraceptive method to better understand the specific effects on body composition.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study revealed that hormonal contraceptive use was associated with significant increases in body fat percentage and reductions in total body water, while no such changes were observed among non-hormonal users or non-contraceptive users. These findings suggest that hormonal contraceptives may uniquely influence body composition dynamics, potentially promoting adiposity and fluid redistribution over time. By controlling for dietary diversity and physical activity, the study strengthens the evidence for a direct biological effect of hormonal contraceptives on fat accumulation, underscoring their role as a modifiable factor in women&#8217;s metabolic health.</p><sec id="sec027"><title>Recommendations</title><p>Monitoring of body composition changes, particularly body fat percentage, among women using hormonal contraceptives by incorporating body composition assessments into primary healthcare visits, to track and manage potential adverse effects.</p><p>Providing nutritional guidance and support to women using hormonal contraceptives to mitigate potential increases in body fat percentage and promote overall health by developing and disseminating educational materials on healthy eating and physical activity tailored to women using hormonal contraceptives. Collaborate with nutritionists to offer personalized dietary advice.</p><p>Future studies should recruit larger and more demographically diverse populations to enhance generalisability and statistical power. In addition, extending the follow-up period beyond six months would allow for a deeper understanding of the longitudinal effects of contraceptive use on body composition. There is also a need to incorporate biochemical markers to better understand the underlying physiological mechanisms that may mediate these changes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>I extend my sincere appreciation to the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Vienna for funding this work through regional project KEN 6025, within which this study was nested.

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;The objective of the paper is relevant, grouping all hormonal and non-hormonal contraceptives in two different categories may obscure important differences between them, particularly in how each type may contribute to changes in body composition. It would be helpful to clearly specify and justify why the different types were combined into a single category.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;This manuscript presents an important and timely study on the association between hormonal contraceptive use and body composition among women in Nyeri County, Kenya, using stable isotope dilution techniques. The topic is relevant and the methodology is scientifically sound.</p><p>However, please confirm that this work has not been published or submitted elsewhere to address any concerns about dual publication.</p><p>I am certain that this paper could be a valuable contribution to the field.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;Overall, this is a good study; however, some improvements are needed. The authors provided all necessary details regarding ethical approval and funding.</p><p>- Can the author justify why in the abstract, the sample size is reported as 114, while in the methods section, it is stated as 119, and at the endline, it is 104. Additionally, a 3-month follow-up is mentioned in the abstract, but the assessment methodology refers to a 6-month follow-up.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>- Overall, the introduction is good but too brief.</p><p>- It would be beneficial to elaborate more, such as providing an overview of non-hormonal contraceptives, including their worldwide prevalence and specific statistics for Kenya, would be helpful.</p><p>- - If available, data/ percentage of women using hormonal contraceptive in Kenya, as well as the most commonly used methods worldwide and within Kenya.</p><p>- - It would enhance the study&#8217;s purpose to elaborate on the selection of "Kamakwa Ward," linking body composition to non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes. Are cardiovascular diseases also involved? This connection would strengthen the public health rationale for the study.</p><p>- More detail about &#8220;Stable Isotope Dilution Techniques (SIDT)&#8221; and which studies have employed these methods would be beneficial.</p><p>- Mentioning the reproductive age of the women studied would help in conveying the results to a broader, non-scientific audience.</p><p>- Clarification is needed on what the authors mean by &#8220;modern contraceptive&#8221; and what constitutes an &#8220;un-modern contraceptive.&#8221;</p><p>Methods, Study Design, and Population:</p><p>- It is important to specify which data collection tool was used for greater precision.</p><p>Statistical Analysis:</p><p>- The authors mention that multivariate regression analysis was conducted; however, no figures are provided to illustrate this regression.</p><p>- Including figures or graphs would be more helpful for the reader to compare than solely using tables.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>- The first two paragraphs of the discussion repeat the results. It would be more effective if the authors compared their findings to those of international studies, highlighting where they are similar or diverge.</p><p>Referencing:</p><p>- Ensure that the references are formatted uniquely; for instance, in the introduction, the first reference is listed as (United Nations, 2019), while subsequent references should follow a consistent format.</p><p>- Reconsider the referencing in the discussion. For example, &#8220;...misinformation about contraceptive methods. Qualitative studies from Kenya (19, 20) and other parts of Africa (23) highlight that concerns about side effects are not represented in the literature; similarly, references 11, 12, and 15 were cited, while references 29 was cited before 28, and 30 and 31 were not cited at all.&#8221;</p><p>Reviewer #4:&#160;This article is well-structured and easily comprehensible. It provides valuable insights into the effects of hormonal contraceptives, a topic that often raises questions within the community. The project contributes to the scientific understanding of this issue and offers practical recommendations. The suggestion to provide dietary and nutritional advice to users of hormonal contraceptives is particularly useful. Such knowledge is crucial for healthcare workers, as the community frequently receives information from them.</p><p>Minor Corrections Needed:</p><p>Some minor corrections are needed regarding spelling and formatting.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Reproductive Health and Contraceptive Use</p><p>The study shows THAT that 68.3% of the WRA were using some form of contraception, a figure</p><p>that compares favourably with national trends in Kenya, where the modern contraceptive</p><p>prevalence rate (mCPR) among married women is around 58% (17).</p><p>Delimitation of the Study</p><p>This study FOCUSSED on examining effects of hormonal contraceptives on the body composition</p><p>and nutritional status of women of reproductive age residing in Kamakwa Ward of Nyeri Central</p><p>Sub-County, Nyeri County Kenya.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>RESPONSES TO REVIEWER&#8217;S COMMENTS</p><p>Manuscript Title: Hormonal Contraceptives and Body Composition by Use of Stable Isotope Dilution Techniques Among Women of Reproductive Age in Nyeri County, Kenya</p><p>We thank the editors and reviewers for their thorough and constructive comments. Below is our point-by-point response to each comment, with explanations of how the manuscript was revised. All page numbers refer to the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Comment: Grouping all hormonal and non-hormonal contraceptives into broad categories may obscure differences. Specify and justify grouping.</p><p>Response: Thank you for the observation. We have now clearly listed the specific types of hormonal (DMPA [injectables], oral pills, implants) and non-hormonal (copper IUDs, condoms) contraceptives used in our Methods section (Page 2 and 5). Justification for grouping is also provided due to sample size limitations and common mechanisms of action. This is also acknowledged in the Limitations section (Page 20).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Comment: Confirm that the work has not been submitted or published elsewhere.</p><p>Response: We confirm that this manuscript has not been submitted or published elsewhere.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Comment: Clarify inconsistencies in sample size (114 vs 119 vs 104); also, abstract mentions 3-month follow-up but methods describe 6 months.</p><p>Response: This has been corrected. The abstract, methods, and results sections now consistently state that 119 participants were recruited, 114 completed baseline SIDT, and 104 completed the endline at six months (Page 2 and 4). A 3-month mid-point check was conducted for compliance only; this has been clarified (Page 5).</p><p>Comment: Expand Introduction; provide prevalence data, rationale for setting, links to NCDs.</p><p>Response: We have expanded the Introduction to include contraceptive use prevalence globally and in Kenya, described types of non-hormonal methods, and linked contraceptive use to obesity and NCDs. We have also justified the selection of Kamakwa Ward based on urbanisation trends and NCD burden (Page 5).</p><p>Comment: Clarify use and validation of data collection tools.</p><p>Response: The Methods (Page 5) section has been updated to include: Use of standardized tools such as the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) and the Women&#8217;s Dietary Diversity Score (WDDS). Details on pilot testing for cultural relevance and translation validation in the local setting (Page 5).</p><p>Comment: Include results of multivariate regression analysis and consider visual summary.</p><p>Response: We have now included the results of a multivariable logistic regression analysis that assessed the association between contraceptive use, physical activity level, dietary diversity score, and increased body fat percentage among women of reproductive age in Nyeri County, Kenya. As presented in Table 6 (Page 14)</p><p>Comment: Discussion repeats results; compare findings with existing literature.</p><p>Response: The Discussion (Pages 15&#8211;18) has been restructured to reduce repetition. Comparative analysis has been included using: Studies from Ethiopia (Mengesha et al., 2020), United States (Berenson et al., 2009), Uganda and South Africa (NAMSAL trial data, 2021), showing similar patterns in weight gain and body composition among hormonal contraceptive users.</p><p>Comment: Address referencing inconsistencies.</p><p>Response: Referencing format has been revised throughout the document for consistency and correct citation order.</p><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>Comment: Minor language, grammar, and formatting issues.</p><p>Response: All noted typos and formatting issues have been corrected, and the manuscript has been revised for consistent use of British English.</p><p>We believe these changes have significantly strengthened the manuscript and are grateful for the opportunity to revise and resubmit.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Signed</p><p>Purity Lang&#8217;at</p><p>On behalf of all authors</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0332299.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Respose to reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0332299.s002.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0332299.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0332299.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Karadeniz</surname><given-names initials="O">Ozan</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Ozan Karadeniz</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Ozan Karadeniz</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj003" xml:lang="en" journal-id="PLoS One" journal-id-type="nlm-ta" ext-link-type="pubmed" xlink:href="40938854"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
