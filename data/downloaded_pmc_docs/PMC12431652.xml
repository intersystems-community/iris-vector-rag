We previously provided evidence that loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 triggered by influenza A virus (IAV) infection promotes activation of host antiviral immunity via a mechanism involving derepression of EREs and production of immunostimulatory RNAs. While the IAV NS1 protein might limit consequences of such activation via its dsRNA-binding activity, we hypothesized that other human pathogenic viruses could have evolved more direct strategies to counteract this potential ERE-based defense system. Here, we reveal that V proteins from diverse paramyxoviruses, including Measles, Mumps, Parainfluenza, and Nipah/Hendra viruses, can all engage with TRIM28. Notably, the efficiency of engagement varies markedly between virus species, a phenotype that can be linked to specific residues within the C-terminal domain of V proteins. Further mapping showed that V proteins target both the TRIM28 Coiled-Coil domain and the TRIM28 PHD-Bromodomain, which contains the functionally-relevant TRIM28 SUMO-modification sites necessary for ERE repression. In this context, while paramyxovirus infection triggers canonical stress-associated phosphorylation of TRIM28, loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 does not occur, and minimal induction of the TRIM28-dependent ERE RNA, HERVK14C, is observed. Furthermore, pre-infection with Parainfluenza virus type 2, which encodes a V protein that efficiently engages with TRIM28, limits subsequent IAV-triggered loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 and upregulation of HERVK14C RNA. These findings dissect the interplay between paramyxoviruses and TRIM28, providing support for the concept of a TRIM28-regulated ERE-based antiviral defense system by uncovering a potential viral antagonistic measure.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Host recognition of viral nucleic acids is fundamental for stimulating antiviral immunity. To prevent aberrant immune activation, cells must precisely differentiate &#8220;non-self&#8221; from &#8220;self&#8221; nucleic acids. Endogenous retroelements (EREs), despite their self-origin, can produce immunostimulatory RNAs that blur this distinction, and may have been functionally co-opted to enhance antiviral immunity in response to some infections. Normally, ERE transcription is repressed by the host protein TRIM28, the function of which is dynamically modulated by SUMO-modification. Here, we demonstrate that paramyxoviruses engage TRIM28, maintaining it in its repressive, SUMO-modified form during infection. We propose that this virus-host interaction limits ERE activation and consequently suppresses ERE-driven immune signaling, revealing a previously unidentified mechanism of immune evasion by paramyxoviruses.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#195;&#182;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_214957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3891-9480</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Hale</surname><given-names>Benjamin G.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008475</institution-id><institution>Hartmann M&#195;&#188;ller-Stiftung f&#195;&#188;r Medizinische Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2378</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3891-9480</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Hale</surname><given-names>Benjamin G.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The research leading to these results received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.snf.ch" ext-link-type="uri">www.snf.ch</ext-link>; grant 310030_214957 to BGH) and the Hartmann M&#252;ller Foundation (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.hms.uzh.ch" ext-link-type="uri">www.hms.uzh.ch</ext-link>; grant 2378 to BGH).

Thus, activity and expression of EREs can disrupt cellular homeostasis in various ways, not only by potential interference with genome integrity via insertional mutagenesis, but also by splicing modulation, epigenetic alterations, and promoter/enhancer activity [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Additionally, the transcription of some EREs has been proposed to produce double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a consequence of bidirectional transcription from ERV LTRs or via read-through transcription and complementarity found in some ERV sequence arrangements [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Such ERE-dsRNA, while technically self-derived, can behave as a mimetic of exogenous virus-derived dsRNA, and thereby trigger unwarranted immune or pro-inflammatory responses by activating antiviral pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Aberrant expression of EREs has therefore been linked to some autoimmune pathologies, such as inflammatory bowel disease, where elevated transcript levels of EREs, including HERV-H and HERV-K, have been observed in affected individuals [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To mitigate these potential deleterious effects, strict repression of ERE expression is critical. Epigenetic silencing mechanisms play a central role in this regulation, and typically include DNA methylation and histone modifications. A key pathway mediating such silencing mechanisms involves Kr&#252;ppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs), which bind specific DNA sequences within ERE loci and, in concert with SUMO-modified Tripartite Motif Protein 28 (TRIM28; KAP1), recruit the methyltransferase SETDB1 to enforce transcriptional repression [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to being entirely negative in consequence, recent studies have generated interest in the concept that ERE activity may have an important functional role, in particular with respect to host immune defenses [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, some ERE regulatory elements have been shown to function as enhancers driving the expression of specific innate immune genes in response to antiviral signals [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-like properties of some transcripts generated from EREs might be used by the host to further potentiate interferon (IFN) responses during exogenous virus infections [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this regard, we previously provided evidence for a host antiviral mechanism triggered by influenza A virus (IAV) infection that involves loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 and the consequent upregulation of ERE transcripts in infected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], some of which appear to form a source of cellular ERE-dsRNA that may be sensed by various antiviral pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Notably, this phenomenon may not be unique to IAV infections, as other viruses (such as SARS-CoV-2, HCV, and HSV-1) have also been reported to induce high expression levels of EREs during infection [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This suggests that infection-triggered ERE derepression may be a co-opted response as part of a broader immune pathway, leading us to hypothesize that some viruses could have evolved antagonistic strategies to counteract this defense mechanism at different levels. For example, we reported that the IAV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has the capacity to interact with infection-induced ERE-dsRNA and potentially to limit ERE-dsRNA engagement with host antiviral dsRNA sensors in the cytosol, thus likely dampening immune activation via this pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Whether additional viruses have evolved similar or unique strategies to limit ERE derepression or sensing is currently unknown. However, it is notable that proteins from several DNA viruses, such as adenovirus E1B-55K [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus vPK [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]/LANA [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and AAV Rep52 [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], can interact with TRIM28, albeit to release viral DNA genomes from direct TRIM28-mediated transcriptional repression [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that other types of viruses also express proteins that engage with TRIM28, but which might limit its function in infection-triggered ERE derepression and potentiation of immune activation.</p><p>In this study, we mined an existing large-scale proteomic dataset to uncover RNA virus proteins that may interact with TRIM28 [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We limited our search to RNA viruses in order to exclude the identification of TRIM28 interactors that likely aid viral DNA genome derepression. Our survey revealed two potential TRIM28 interactor candidates: Measles virus (MeV; <italic toggle="yes">Paramyxoviridae</italic>) V and La Crosse virus (<italic toggle="yes">Bunyaviridae</italic>) NSs [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Here, we focused on V protein, a potent virulence factor expressed by many <italic toggle="yes">Paramyxoviridae</italic> family members that antagonizes the IFN system at multiple independent levels [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays, we show that the ability to engage with TRIM28 is a broadly conserved property of V proteins from across the <italic toggle="yes">Paramyxoviridae</italic> family, albeit interaction efficiencies vary between viruses. Importantly, the C-terminal domain of V is necessary and sufficient for TRIM28 engagement, and domain-mapping revealed that one target for V is the region of TRIM28 that harbors the functionally-relevant TRIM28 SUMO-modification sites. Notably, both paramyxovirus and IAV infections were observed to trigger phosphorylation of TRIM28 at S824, which is associated with chromatin relaxation [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but only IAV infection caused a loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 and upregulation of TRIM28-dependent ERE transcripts. Furthermore, pre-infection of cells with a paramyxovirus expressing a V protein that efficiently engages TRIM28 was able to partially inhibit subsequent IAV-induced loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28, as well as limit IAV-induced upregulation of a TRIM28-dependent ERE transcript. This study therefore provides further insights into the interplay between RNA viruses and TRIM28. The identification of paramyxovirus V protein engagement with TRIM28 supports the concept that some viruses may have evolved countermeasures to TRIM28-regulated ERE-based antiviral defense systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Paramyxovirus V proteins engage with TRIM28</title><p>In an effort to identify potential viral antagonists of TRIM28-regulated ERE-based antiviral defense systems, and thus provide evidence for its biological significance, we surveyed an existing proteomic dataset of virus-host protein-protein interactions to uncover viral proteins that could co-immunoprecipitate human TRIM28 [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. From 70 viral proteins tested, the V protein of MeV and the NSs protein of La Crosse virus were identified as candidate factors potentially able to interact with TRIM28 [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We initially focused on the V protein and proceeded to verify this interaction through targeted co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays, while also expanding the initial observation to a wider set of diverse paramyxovirus V proteins. Thus, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged mCherry or FLAG-tagged V proteins from Hendra virus (HeV), Mapuera virus (MapV), MeV, Menangle virus (MenV), Mumps virus (MuV), Newcastle Disease virus (NDV), Nipah virus (NiV), Parainfluenza virus 2 (PIV2), Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), Sendai virus (SeV), or Tioman virus (TioV).

Subsequent western blot analysis revealed that TRIM28 could be specifically co-precipitated with all FLAG-tagged V proteins tested, but not with the FLAG-tagged mCherry control (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). While this result indicates a broadly conserved engagement of paramyxovirus V proteins and TRIM28, quantification of western blot band intensities revealed clear differences in the relative efficiencies of TRIM28 co-precipitation by each V protein (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). For example, PIV2-V consistently co-precipitated the most TRIM28, while MeV-V demonstrated mid-level efficiency, and PIV5-V and NiV-V exhibited amongst the poorest efficiencies (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To validate the interaction observation under infection conditions, we infected the human lung carcinoma cell-line, A549, with PIV5 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2 PFU/cell, and 24 hours later prepared total soluble cell lysates for co-IP studies using an anti-TRIM28 antibody and an anti-V5 antibody, which targets a common epitope on both the PIV5 V and P proteins. Consistent with the results from our transfection-based assays, we observed co-precipitation of TRIM28 with anti-V5 antibody only from infected cell lysates (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Reciprocally, V/P proteins were specifically co-precipitated with the anti-TRIM28, but not control, antibody from PIV5-infected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).

We then generated six chimeric FLAG-tagged V protein constructs by swapping CTD segments between PIV2-V and PIV5-V, which were defined by highly-conserved CTD amino acid sequence motifs: HRRE, WCNP, and CTC (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).

This distinct pattern revealed the critical role of the proximal part of the V CTD (sequence between the HRRE and WNCP motifs) in determining engagement with TRIM28.

To further validate this, we generated the reciprocal substitution in PIV5-V (Y175W) and could show that this change conferred an enhanced ability of PIV5-V to co-precipitate TRIM28 (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1013487.g002" ref-type="fig">I</xref>).

Similarly, an assessment of three structurally adjacent residues showed no obvious pattern explaining the differential TRIM28 engagement observed experimentally. Thus, while PIV2/PIV5 V protein residues 178/175 contribute to TRIM28 engagement efficiency, a more complex motif likely determines efficiency in the context of other paramyxovirus V proteins, which could be related to unknown nuclear targeting and/or retention sequences if intracellular localization is a factor in the interaction capacity.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>The TRIM28 PHD-Bromodomain and Coiled-Coil domain are targets for V</title><p>We next sought to identify the specific regions of TRIM28 targeted by V. TRIM28 consists of six well-characterized domains: the Really Interesting New Gene domain (RING; harboring E3 ubiquitin ligase activity), two BBox domains (enabling TRIM28 oligomerization), the Coiled-Coil domain (CC; that recruits KRAB-ZNF co-factors), a Linker domain (LNK; containing the HP1 binding site), and the PHD-Bromodomain (PB; essential for self-SUMOylation, and for recruiting the SUMO E2 enzyme, NuRD, and SETDB1) [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We therefore generated a series of HA-tagged TRIM28 truncation mutants representing individual or combined TRIM28 domains (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Subsequently, these constructs (alongside HA-tagged FL TRIM28) were transfected into TRIM28-knockout HEK293T cells (HEK293T-T28KO) together with FLAG-tagged mCherry or FLAG-tagged MeV-V, and their ability to be co-precipitated with each FLAG-tagged protein was assessed. MeV-V was chosen for these assays due to its intermediate TRIM28 engagement phenotype (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Strikingly, only HA-tagged TRIM28 constructs containing the CC or PB domains were specifically co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged V protein, whereas constructs lacking both of these domains showed no clear interaction (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g003" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). It was notable that the PB domain alone, which contains all the functionally-relevant TRIM28 SUMO-modification sites required for transcriptional repression, was co-precipitated with V to an extent similar to that of FL TRIM28, which may indicate that PB is the major target of V. Importantly, this domain also contains the phosphorylation site S824, which has been linked to chromatin relaxation [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

Similarly, the CC domain shows near-complete conservation across mammals (99.4% identity, 100% similarity), with chicken TRIM28 again displaying higher divergence (82% identity, 93.6% similarity). Given that NiV and HeV are bat-borne and can infect horses, the high similarity between bat, horse and human TRIM28 suggests that the inefficient engagement of NiV and HeV V proteins with human TRIM28 is not due to a species-specific adaptation.</p><p>TRIM28 belongs to the transcriptional intermediary factor 1 (TIF-1) family, a sub-group of TRIM proteins involved in chromatin regulation, transcriptional repression, and genome stability [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Alongside TRIM28, all other TIF-1 family members (TRIM24, TRIM33, and TRIM66) also contain PB domains. To determine whether the engagement of V protein with TRIM28 PB extends to other TIF-1 family members, we co-transfected HEK293T-T28KO cells with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged MeV-V or mCherry, and HA-tagged PB domains of TRIM28, TRIM24, TRIM33, or TRIM66. Strikingly, all TIF-1 PB domains were specifically co-immunoprecipitated by FLAG-tagged MeV-V, indicating that V might have the capacity to engage, directly or indirectly, with multiple members of the TIF-1 family via their PB domains (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>), although we cannot dissect contributions from the endogenous full-length TIF-1 family member proteins in this experimental system. Notably, while the function of TRIM66 is poorly characterized, TRIM24, TRIM28, and TRIM33 all reportedly form complexes that co-purify with the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, as well as HP1, suggesting cooperative roles in chromatin modification and transcriptional repression [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Paramyxovirus infection triggers stress-associated phosphorylation of TRIM28, but not loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28</title><p>The finding that TRIM28 PB is a major target for V protein is intriguing given the importance of this domain in mediating transcriptional repression, and its harboring of important regulatory post-translational modification sites such as critical SUMO-modifications and the stress-regulated phosphorylation site at S824.

We therefore hypothesized that V protein engagement with the TRIM28 PB during infection may act to disrupt regulated TRIM28 functions. To this end, we sought to analyze differences in infection-triggered changes to TRIM28 between PIV2 (representing a virus encoding a V protein that engages efficiently with TRIM28) and PIV5 (representing a virus encoding a V protein that engages less efficiently with TRIM28). Furthermore, we aimed to compare these paramyxovirus infections to infection with IAV, given that IAV infection leads to loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 and the consequent upregulation of ERE transcripts in infected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, we infected A549 cells with each virus at an MOI of 2-5 PFU/cell and subsequently prepared total cell lysates at various times post-infection. Western blot analysis revealed that all three (PIV2, PIV5, IAV) infections induced phosphorylation of TRIM28 at S824 (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1013487.g004" ref-type="fig">B</xref>), suggesting that infection with each of these viruses results in a cellular stress response similar to that induced by the DNA damage-causing molecule etoposide, which served as a positive control for TRIM28 S824 phosphorylation. Interestingly, previous investigations of IAV-induced TRIM28 phosphorylation did not report upregulation of S824 phosphorylation upon IAV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

Despite the observed similarities in virus-induced TRIM28 S824 phosphorylation, the effects of infection on SUMO2/3-modified TRIM28 were markedly different between the viruses: while IAV infection led to a near-total loss of SUMO2/3-modified TRIM28, together with a global increase in total SUMO2/3 conjugates as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], neither PIV2 nor PIV5 infection resulted in any detectable loss of SUMO2/3-modified TRIM28 (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1013487.g004" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Indeed, quantification of results from independent replicates revealed a potentially subtle increase in SUMO2/3-modified TRIM28 levels in paramyxovirus-infected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1013487.g004" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Interestingly, a previous study reported that SeV infection led to increased levels of SUMOylated TRIM28 in HEK293T cells [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], supporting our observation that paramyxovirus infection does not reduce, and may even increase, SUMO2/3-modified TRIM28 levels. Overall, these data suggest a shared host response to paramyxovirus and IAV infections leading to stress-associated TRIM28 phosphorylation at S824. While this phosphorylation event has been linked to loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], which occurs during IAV infection, loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 does not appear to occur during paramyxovirus infections. It is tempting to speculate that engagement of V with the PB domain of TRIM28, which occurs independently of TRIM28-S824 (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>), may act to limit loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 during paramyxovirus infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>PIV2, but not PIV5, can dampen IAV-induced loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 and limit derepression of a TRIM28-dependent ERE</title><p>The precise molecular pathways by which some virus infections (particularly IAV) trigger loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 and lead to derepression of EREs with potentiation of immune activation remain poorly understood [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This limits the experimental possibilities to dissect the potential for paramyxovirus V proteins alone to antagonize such responses. To overcome this, we therefore designed a strategy to assess whether pre-infection with a paramyxovirus encoding a V protein that engages efficiently with TRIM28 (PIV2) could limit subsequent IAV infection-induced loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 and derepression of EREs. Thus, A549 cells were first infected (or mock) with PIV2 at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell for 24 hours, allowing V protein expression and its potential association with TRIM28. In parallel, A549 cells were similarly infected with PIV5 to represent a virus encoding a V protein that engages less efficiently with TRIM28. These infections were followed by a subsequent 10 hour super-infection with IAV (MOI of 5 PFU/cell) to allow for infection-triggered loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28. As shown by immunofluorescence microscopy, the desired infectivity was achieved for all viruses used, with approximately 90% of cells in co-infected conditions infected with PIV2 or PIV5, and approximately 80% with IAV (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Following on from this, we assessed the levels of SUMO2/3-modified TRIM28 in total cell lysates from each condition using SUMO2/3 immunoprecipitation followed by western blot. Remarkably, while IAV infection alone resulted in the clear loss of SUMO2/3-modified TRIM28, this loss was markedly reduced in cells pre-infected with PIV2 (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). In contrast, pre-infection with PIV5 did not provide substantial protection against IAV-induced loss of SUMO2/3-modified TRIM28 (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Importantly, these differences were not due to differences in IAV infection/replication efficiency caused by the pre-infecting paramyxovirus, as determined by co-infection immunostaining (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>), assessment of IAV protein levels (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>), or assessment of changes in global SUMO2/3-conjugated protein levels (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). The ability of PIV2, but not PIV5, pre-infection to limit IAV-induced loss of SUMO2/3-modified TRIM28 correlates well with our observation that PIV2-V, but not PIV5-V, efficiently engages with TRIM28. It may be that the more efficient engagement of PIV2-V with TRIM28 is necessary to suppress the strong heterologous IAV-triggered effects on TRIM28, while in the context of the homologous virus infections, the less efficient PIV5-V is sufficient to limit effects triggered by PIV5 (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>).

The results relating to HERVK14C are of particular interest, as this ERE is well-established to be strictly repressed by TRIM28 [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], making it a key benchmark ERE for assessing TRIM28 functionality. In this context, and similar to prior PIV2 infection, transfection of HEK293T cells with a plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged PIV2-V was sufficient to limit subsequent IAV-mediated induction of HERVK14C (<xref rid="ppat.1013487.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5I</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1013487.g005" ref-type="fig">J</xref>). Thus, the ability of prior PIV2 infection, as well as expression of an efficient TRIM28-engaging V protein (PIV2-V) alone, to limit IAV-mediated induction of TRIM28-specific HERVK14C supports the hypothesis that a paramyxovirus V protein can limit stress-induced loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 and thereby maintain transcriptional repression of certain EREs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec008"><title>Discussion</title><p>Paramyxovirus V proteins are well-known antagonists of canonical innate immune signaling [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], yet our description of their engagement with TRIM28, a chromatin-associated transcriptional repressor, suggests a hitherto unknown additional activity. TRIM28, and its associated SUMO-modification, plays a key role in silencing transcription through nucleating chromatin remodeling complexes, and is particularly critical for the repression of young EREs [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that multiple paramyxovirus V proteins can complex with TRIM28, both in transient overexpression- and infection- based co-immunoprecipitation assays. Given that V proteins have primarily been thought to target cytoplasmic immune pathways, such an interaction with a nuclear transcriptional repressor is notable, although a large body of existing data has indicated that V proteins can stably or transiently enter the nucleus [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Based on the data provided herein, TRIM28 engagement by V proteins may therefore provide insight into a previously unknown nuclear function for these viral virulence factors. Unlike IAV infection, PIV2 and PIV5 infections did not lead to loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28, despite all three infections inducing the stress-associated TRIM28 phosphorylation at S824 that has been linked to reduction in SUMO-modified TRIM28 levels [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Furthermore, pre-infection with PIV2 (or sole expression of its V protein that efficiently engages with TRIM28) limited subsequent IAV-triggered loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 and/or derepression of selected EREs. Thus, paramyxovirus V proteins may have a function in engaging a nuclear TRIM28-containing complex to limit infection-triggered induction of certain EREs that may otherwise negatively impact virus replication via mechanisms including ERE-driven immune activation [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While the IAV NS1 protein may also limit ERE-driven immunity by sequestering ERE-derived dsRNA away from cytosolic sensors [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the identification of paramyxovirus V proteins as potentially more direct inhibitors of this system lends further support to the concept that a TRIM28-regulated ERE-based antiviral defense is a <italic toggle="yes">bona fide</italic> pathway to which some viruses have evolved antagonistic strategies.</p><p>The precise triggers and consequent mechanisms by which some viral infections lead to loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 remain largely unclear, which currently limits detailed molecular studies during paramyxovirus infections. However, in different contexts, several pathways for this loss have been identified, including TRIM28 deSUMOylation by SUMO-specific proteases, phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (such as RNF4) for ubiquitination-dependent degradation of SUMO-modified TRIM28, and destabilization of SUMO-modified TRIM28 via XAF1 during immune activation [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Given that a major TRIM28 target domain for V proteins appears to be the PB domain that harbors the lysine residues primarily modified by SUMO paralogs, it will be important to determine which of these processes may be influenced by V protein engagement with TRIM28. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay of V with TRIM28 may be complex, given our observation that V proteins also appear to engage with the CC domain of TRIM28. In addition, it is worth noting that we found evidence that V proteins can also potentially engage with the PB domains of other TIF-1 family members, such as TRIM24, TRIM33, and TRIM66. The exact functional coordination of these interactions, whether single or multiple complexes form, and which factor is the direct target for V, remain open questions to dissect in future studies. TIF-1 family members have been found together in the same complexes previously, and can exhibit both functional overlaps with TRIM28 and independent activities [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. For example, similar to TRIM28, TRIM24 undergoes ATM-mediated phosphorylation during the DNA damage response, but this leads to TRIM24 destabilization and upregulation of pro-apoptotic p53, a defined ubiquitination target for TRIM24 [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Nevertheless, knock-out of TRIM24 can lead to ERE derepression and triggering of an IFN response, drawing clear functional parallels with TRIM28 [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. TRIM33 and TRIM66 are also implicated in DNA damage responses [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], acting co-operatively with TIF-1 family members for transcriptional silencing [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Similar to TRIM28, TRIM33 has also been implicated in additional activities, such as mediating ubiquitination events that can activate NLRP3 inflammasomes [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It will be worthwhile to dissect the potential consequences of V protein engagement with different TIF-1 family members and how this might contribute to immune or inflammatory evasion during paramyxovirus infection.</p><p>A key striking finding of our study was the observation that V proteins from distinct paramyxoviruses appear to engage differentially with human TRIM28. While we identified a single amino acid position in the CTDs of PIV2 and PIV5 V proteins that clearly influences this phenotype, candidate contributors to the phenotypes of the other paramyxovirus V proteins tested were not obvious from primary sequence alignments. This suggests that the sequence determinants in V responsible for such differential engagement are highly complex. Notably, the potential cellular localization of V proteins from different paramyxoviruses may correlate well with the variation in their abilities to co-immunoprecipitate TRIM28. For instance, PIV2-V, which was reported to be predominantly nuclear [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], efficiently precipitates TRIM28, whereas PIV5-V, which might exhibit a more diffuse nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], shows less efficient TRIM28 precipitation capacity. In this regard, the region of PIV2-V that we identified as important for engagement with TRIM28 has previously been implicated in its strong nuclear targeting and retention [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Furthermore, NiV-V, which is mostly cytoplasmic but can transiently shuttle into the nucleus [<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013487.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], was identified by us as being one of the weakest engagers of human TRIM28. Extensive further mapping efforts are therefore required to dissect TRIM28 precipitation differences between paramyxovirus V proteins. Such studies will be essential before any functional correlations of TRIM28 engagement can be made with respect to potential paramyxovirus host-range determinants or viral virulence. Nevertheless, this will be an intriguing area of future study.</p><p>Taken together, our work provides evidence suggesting a previously unrecognized function of paramyxovirus V proteins in engaging and modulating the action of host nuclear TRIM28. While V proteins are well-established as antagonists of canonical cytoplasmic IFN signaling pathways, our new findings raise the possibility that V proteins also engage TRIM28 to suppress infection-triggered ERE-driven antiviral mechanisms. Our data therefore add to the emerging evidence that virus infections trigger, and therefore must at least partially antagonize, ERE-based antiviral defense systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Cells, compounds and viruses.</title><p>A549, MDCK, Vero CCL-81 and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco&#8217;s Modified Eagle&#8217;s Medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 &#956;g/mL streptomycin (Gibco Life Technologies).

<bold>Additional Editor Comments :</bold>
</p><p>Most of the comments can likely be addressed with text responses and minor changes, though I would suggest experimentally addressing the following critiques:</p><p>1. Reviewer 1 requests evidence that V/TRIM28 interaction is not a post-lysis artifact given the disparate localizations of the two proteins.</p><p>2. Co-infection experiments requested by Reviewer 1. IAV infection of V-transfected cells may be the most straightforward experiment.</p><p>

<bold>Reviewers' Comments:</bold>
</p><p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p><p>
<bold>Part I - Summary</bold>
</p><p>Please use this section to discuss strengths/weaknesses of study, novelty/significance, general execution and scholarship.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;The authors show a novel interaction between TRIM28 and the paramyxovirus V protein. Using coIPs, the authors show interaction between TRIM28 and the V proteins of several paramyxoviruses. Furthermore, the authors map the interaction between PIV2 and PIV5 V proteins and TRIM28 to the C-terminus of V and the domains of TRIM28 interacting with V. Point mutations are then generated to test the importance of specific residues necessary for TRIM28-V interactions. A few issues need to be addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;The manuscript by Lieber et al. characterizes a novel TRIM28 binding function by the V protein of different paramyxoviruses. TRIM28, when SUMOylated can repress transcription of endogenous retroelements, which can have an impact on antiviral immunity, as in the case of influenza A virus, as described by the authors. Here, they described the TRIM28-V protein interaction and identify key regions of the V protein and TRIM28 where the interaction occurs. Interestingly there are differences in TRIM28 affinity depending on which paramyxovirus V protein is tested, the implications of which are not completely understood and can be further studied. Also of note was that this interaction did not lead to loss of ERE repression that is seen during influenza infection. Pre-infection with PIV-2, whose V protein has a strong interaction with TRIM28, prevented the loss of TRIM28 SUMOylation seen during subsequent influenza infection, significantly impacting ERE transcription.</p><p>The authors present their story in a compelling fashion and in a logical step-wise manner that is easy to follow and coherent. They convincingly show that V-TRIM28 interaction occurs and through specific C terminal domains in the V protein interacting with CC and PHB domains of TRIM28. The authors bring up several current unknowns and possible areas for future study in the discussion. I have only minor comments and questions for the authors</p><p>For the initial experiments, the authors perform coIP at 24 hours post-transfection and post-infection. During infection, what are the kinetics of V protein expression? Would it be of interest to examine how early V is expressed and begins to interact with TRIM28? Conversely, particularly during infection, which may last days, how stable is the V-TRIM28 interaction and for how long can EREs remain repressed? Presumably new V is produced during infection of new cells and continues this effect. The authors use a high MOI to produce infection in a high % of cells. But if a lower MOI is used and a small fraction of cells are infected initially, does the stress response in infection cells lead to derepression of EREs and possible innate immune stimulation in neighboring, uninfected cells that may negate the impact of this effect in infected cells?</p><p>In fig 1 the anticipated sizes of the V proteins of various paramyxoviruses varies considerably with HeV, NiV, and SeV are approximately 2x as large as others. Is this expected? This is my naivety with respect to different viruses in the family.</p><p>For figure 4, are C and D simply replicates of the same experiments? There are no differences between the panels other than the blot bands, but it is not explicitly stated anywhere that this is the case, so it was a bit confusing. The same for Fig 3 C and D. these are different domains being tested so that can be gleaned from looking at the labels, but it is not obvious and not obvious from the figure caption either.</p><p>For figure 3, the experiments were done in TRIM28 KO cells but for the experiments with TRIM24, 33, 66 were these also knocked out? Since you&#8217;re only looking at the specific domains, it is less of a concern that what you&#8217;re seeing in the blot is FL protein as a false positive, however this may impact V-TRIM interactions.</p><p>In the methods for influenza infection, the authors do not indicate if they used exogenous trypsin to aid in infection. They use a high MOI and look at the effects shortly after infection, so it is probably not an issue because they don&#8217;t need efficient replication of the virus. However a statement about this could be added.</p><p>The authors interestingly note that V proteins are usually cytoplasmic, and this interaction with nuclear proteins is novel. Is anything known about nuclear localization of V proteins? The authors mention previous studies showing it in the nucleus but with no known function. Is the C terminal domain critical also for nuclear localization? The authors could look at how it locates and important domains for this. They touch on this and speculate but did not explore it experimentally.</p><p>The authors do not actually look at any innate immune signaling that may or may not be triggered by transcription of EREs in their transfection or infection systems. This would be an important downstream effect that could shed light on outcomes of infection, at least in vitro.</p><p>Is there a reason why there are no</p><p>To me the most interesting finding is regarding NiV V and how it&#8217;s TRIM28 precipitation was less efficient, though it would probably be thought of as the most virulent of these viruses in humans. This is raised by the authors in the discussion however it seems to me that if this is the case, then during infection of hosts (particularly humans or other susceptible animals) that even if V is suppressing ERE transcription and this does have an impact on innate immunity, the effect likely is not impacting infection outcomes in the host and plays only a very minor role. It also could be that other innate immune signaling via other means dwarfs that being induced by EREs. Something interested to pursue further.</p><p>**********</p><p>
<bold>Part II &#8211; Major Issues: Key Experiments Required for Acceptance</bold>
</p><p>Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be <underline>absolutely</underline> required to validate study conclusions.</p><p>Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject".</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Figure 1. (applies for all CoIPs). TRIM28 is thought to be localized to the nucleus and V protein is localized to the cytoplasm. It would be important to isolate nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions separately and not total cell lysates to show that the interaction observed between TRIM28 and V is not an artifact of the lysis procedure.</p><p>Figure 2.</p><p>- Panel 1A shows MeV V migrating close to the 37kDa marker. However, in Figure 1, MeV V migrates close to the 25kDa marker. Please explain and clarify if this is a mistake.</p><p>- Panel 2B - mCherry migrates at a different position compared to Figure 1A. The migration pattern between mCherry, PIV2, and PIV5 is similar, but the marker is not. Please clarify if figure 1 is correct.</p><p>- Panel 2E, G, I - Plotting relative co-IP on different axis types (log vs linear) prevents the reader from easily comparing results between panels. Please use a uniform axis type.</p><p>Figure 3 - Since the similarity between TRIM28 across species is highly conserved, it would be useful to include locations of non-conserved residues between species as part of the schematic. According to the sequence identify, there should only be 5-15 changes between humans and mice. would be easiest to show as a sequence alignment in supplement.</p><p>Figure 3 Panel B,C, and E - MeV V is above 37kDa. However, in Figure 1a, MeV V is close to 25kDa. Explain.</p><p>Figure 4 - Panel E and F - How can you make error bars representing Standard Deviation using an N of 2? Please change to range.</p><p>Co-infection studies</p><p>In addition to coinfections, it would be very important to show the effects of PIV2/PIV5 coinfection with influenza are due to the V protein or a different viral protein. Transfection of cells with V protein expression plasmids, followed by infection with influenza would greatly strengthen the arguments proposed by the author if the results are the same. Particularly when it comes to SUMO2/3 activity and ERE activation/RNA levels. One more thing, the authors have a delta V PIV5 virus. It would be highly relevant to include this virus with the coinfection studies to show the effects of delta V PIV5 on both SUMO2/3 activity and ERE activation.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;(No Response)</p><p>**********</p><p>
<bold>Part III &#8211; Minor Issues: Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications</bold>
</p><p>Please use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Figure 5) Fluorescence microscopy showing the localization of PIV2/PIV5 V and TRIM28 would greatly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;(No Response)</p><p>**********</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ext-link-type="uri">what does this mean?</ext-link> ).

</p><p>Dear Prof Hale,</p><p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript 'TRIM28 is a target for paramyxovirus V proteins' has been provisionally accepted for publication in PLOS Pathogens.</p><p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests.</p><p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p><p>IMPORTANT: The editorial review process is now complete. PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling, formatting or significant scientific errors from this point onwards. Requests for major changes, or any which affect the scientific understanding of your work, will cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript.</p><p>Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us now if you or your institution is planning to press release the article. All press must be co-ordinated with PLOS.</p><p>Thank you again for supporting Open Access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Pathogens.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Thomas Hoenen</p><p>Section Editor</p><p>PLOS Pathogens</p><p>Thomas Hoenen</p><p>Section Editor</p><p>PLOS Pathogens</p><p>Sumita Bhaduri-McIntosh</p><p>Editor-in-Chief</p><p>PLOS Pathogens</p><p>orcid.org/0000-0003-2946-9497</p><p>Michael Malim</p><p>Editor-in-Chief</p><p>PLOS Pathogens</p><p>orcid.org/0000-0002-7699-2064</p><p>***********************************************************</p><p>The authors have sufficiently addressed the reviewers' comments.</p><p>Reviewer Comments (if any, and for reference):</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="ppat.1013487.r004" specific-use="acceptance-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1013487.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Acceptance letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Hoenen</surname><given-names initials="T">Thomas</given-names></name><role>Section Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Thomas Hoenen</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Thomas Hoenen</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.ppat.1013487" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/></front-stub><body><p>Dear Prof Hale,</p><p>We are delighted to inform you that your manuscript, "TRIM28 is a target for paramyxovirus V proteins," has been formally accepted for publication in PLOS Pathogens.</p><p>We have now passed your article onto the PLOS Production Department who will complete the rest of the pre-publication process. All authors will receive a confirmation email upon publication.</p><p>The corresponding author will soon be receiving a typeset proof for review, to ensure errors have not been introduced during production. Please review the PDF proof of your manuscript carefully, as this is the last chance to correct any scientific or type-setting errors. Please note that major changes, or those which affect the scientific understanding of the work, will likely cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript. Note: Proofs for Front Matter articles (Pearls, Reviews, Opinions, etc...) are generated on a different schedule and may not be made available as quickly.</p><p>Soon after your final files are uploaded, the early version of your manuscript, if you opted to have an early version of your article, will be published online. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p><p>You will receive an invoice from PLOS for your publication fee after your manuscript has reached the completed accept phase. If you receive an email requesting payment before acceptance or for any other service, this may be a phishing scheme.
