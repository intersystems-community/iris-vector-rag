Existing reviews remain focused on traditional biomarkers, making it necessary to supplement the evidence in this field, particularly given the rapid advancements in wearable and AI technologies. The scoping review protocol aims to systematically evaluate AI-based predictive models using wearable devices for AD, with a focus on their measurement outcomes and model development processes. The review will follow the Arksey and O&#8217;Malley framework and incorporate PRISMA-ScR guidelines. This study will search multiple databases, including Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PubMed, covering relevant gray literature. The quality of the included studies will be rigorously assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) and Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklists. Two independent reviewers will conduct title and abstract screening, retrieve and assess full-text evidence sources, and extract data. The results will be narratively synthesized and presented in tables and figures. The knowledge gained from this review is expected to provide systematic evidence supporting AI-based predictive models that combine wearable devices for AD, potentially offering insights into model construction details such as data collection and external validation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Zhejiang Province Traditional Chinese Medicine, Science, and Technology Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>2023ZF134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9132-1189</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Shihua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017594</institution-id><institution>Medical Science and Technology Project of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022KY1052</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9132-1189</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Shihua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017577</institution-id><institution>Basic Public Welfare Research Program of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LBY23H200002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Xiaodong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Zhejiang Province Traditional Chinese Medicine, Science, and Technology Project (2023ZF134) supported by SC, Zhejiang Provincial Medical and Health Science and Technology Program Project (2022KY1052) supported by SC,First-Class Course of Zhejiang Province (2022-1133) supported by SC,Basic Public Welfare Research Project/Joint Fund Project of Zhejiang Province: Research on accurate localization of gait disorder brain region in Parkinson's disease based on pfMRI data set and hierarchical Bayesian model(LBY23H200002), supported by XL.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>No datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.

According to the World Health Organization, over 55 million people are affected by dementia [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) accounting for 60% to 70% of cases [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. AD is primarily characterized by cognitive impairment, memory loss, and a range of motor function deficits [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Due to its complex etiology and mechanisms, effective treatments capable of fully reversing the disease course remain unavailable, placing a substantial burden on both society and families [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, early diagnosis and prediction are crucial for optimizing care management strategies and delaying disease progression. Currently, clinical diagnosis of AD mainly relies on neuropsychological assessments and biomarker testing based on the ATN framework [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, these methods are costly, invasive, and complex to administer, and are prone to biases from patient self-reports and external factors [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. With advancements in technology, wearable devices have emerged as a promising tool for early diagnosis. These devices offer non-invasive, high-frequency monitoring capabilities and provide new insights for more convenient health management, potentially serving as a valuable complement to existing diagnostic methods [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>With the rapid advancement of AI technology, machine learning has become a critical tool in the healthcare field, particularly in disease prediction and diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The fundamental principles of machine learning can be divided into three major categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In AD prediction, supervised learning methods are particularly widely used due to their ability to train models based on labeled data, enabling the differentiation of various disease states. For example, algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests have achieved significant results in tasks such as gait analysis and EEG signal analysis. Unsupervised learning also plays a crucial role in the absence of labeled data, particularly in exploring differences and characteristics of AD subtypes. Clustering algorithms can help researchers uncover potential disease patterns. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, shows promise in personalized treatment and real-time prediction by optimizing decision-making processes, offering new directions for patient health management.. In the prediction of AD, wearable devices can provide various types of data (such as physiological signals, gait, and activity levels), and when integrated with machine learning, they enable high-frequency monitoring and personalized diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Clinical prediction models use multiple variables to estimate current diagnostic outcomes (diagnostic models) or predict future disease outcomes (prognostic models). Several studies have developed predictive models for AD based on wearable devices. For example, Younghoon Jeon used SHIMMER wearable devices to monitor gait data and combined algorithms such as random forests and AdaBoost, achieving an accuracy rate of 72% [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ahsan Shahzad developed a support vector machine model, achieving an accuracy rate of 70% [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Kyeonggu Lee utilized wearable EEG signals to build a multilayer perceptron model, achieving an accuracy rate of 74% [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In our recent study, we integrated multiple wearable sensors within a three-stage federated learning framework to develop a home-based AD detection system [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, we constructed the EmoMarker system using wearable microphones and depth cameras, achieving a classification accuracy of 81.13% by leveraging motion and acoustic data [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].In the framework where AI is integrated with wearable devices, the selection and training of models are key to successful application. Typically, choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm (such as deep learning, random forests, or support vector machines) and training it based on the characteristics of patient data and clinical needs can optimize the model&#8217;s predictive performance. For example, when the model needs to handle complex time-series data (such as gait studies in neurodegenerative diseases), methods like recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory networks have demonstrated superior performance [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similarly, graph neural networks play a crucial role in the spatiotemporal processing of EEG data by simultaneously considering the dynamic changes in the time series and the spatial relationships between different brain regions [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, despite the initial progress in applying machine learning techniques to AD prediction, several challenges remain. First, early symptoms of AD are often difficult to detect, and physiological changes are typically slow, requiring machine learning models to have high sensitivity in identifying subtle changes from low signal-to-noise ratio data. Furthermore, data gaps, individual differences, and the heterogeneity of multi-source data pose significant challenges to model training and validation. Therefore, selecting appropriate features, handling missing data, and optimizing model structures have become key factors in improving prediction accuracy and robustness.</p><p>The potential of these technologies is currently being explored. However, many reviews tend to focus on AI models for traditional biomarkers in AD, failing to address the developmental potential of wearable devices in Alzheimer&#8217;s. Only two systematic reviews [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] have integrated wearable devices with AI models in the context of AD. Furthermore, these reviews do not adequately demonstrate the feasibility of integrating wearable devices with AI technologies. In their descriptions of wearable devices, they fail to provide detailed information on data collection processes, such as device selection, specific collection strategies and paradigms, as well as the dropout and data loss rates during the collection of different types of data (e.g., gait, eye movement, neurophysiological data), and the reasons for these issues (e.g., device malfunction, participant dropout, or non-standard data collection).</p><p>Regarding AI models, these reviews lack specific details on model construction, such as feature selection strategies, handling of missing data, sample balancing strategies, comparisons of different algorithm performances, and validation methods. These details are crucial for building wearable device-based machine learning models in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p><p>To fill these gaps, a comprehensive review of existing literature is needed. This review should provide a detailed analysis of the workflow from data collection to external validation of models, offering a comprehensive overview of existing model construction. It will help to understand the current state of research, analyze mainstream methods, and evaluate key improvements made so far. Specific topics for analysis and discussion include the differences in wearable device types and data collection protocols, key digital biomarkers for different types of data, whether missing data handling and sample balancing are commonly performed in current research, and the performance differences between traditional algorithms, deep learning models, and complex ensemble models. Additionally, the status of external validation in existing research should be examined in more detail. The AI models constructed in each study will be evaluated using PROBAST to assess their risk of bias and applicability.</p><p>These findings will provide valuable insights for future work, including whether systematic reviews and meta-analyses should be conducted, the development of new models, or the validation of the applicability of existing models. Given the breadth of this goal, a scoping review is the most appropriate approach [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The unique contribution of this protocol lies in its development of a systematic evaluation and comprehensive review of AI prediction models based on wearable devices. By providing a comprehensive review of existing research, it addresses the gap in the current literature concerning the integration of these two technologies. Specifically, we aim to report on several key dimensions, including the selection of wearable devices, data collection paradigms, feature selection strategies, model construction and training, model validation, and model transparency. In addition to analyzing the applications of various wearable devices, we explore how advanced AI techniques can enhance their diagnostic accuracy and monitoring capabilities. This approach offers new perspectives for the early diagnosis of AD, prediction of disease progression, and personalized healthcare.

For unimodal models, further classification is performed based on the specific data sources captured (e.g., variations in the type of wearable devices and their placement locations lead to differences in the types of data collected). These models are expected to include gait models, manual models, physiological signal models, speech models, and possibly eye-tracking models. For multimodal models that involve multiple data types or integrate omics data, scale information, and other content, we will further discuss the fusion methods of the root modalities (early fusion, mid-fusion, late fusion, and hybrid fusion).

In multimodal studies, unimodal and multimodal models are typically constructed and compared, with specific performance metrics provided to highlight the differences in performance between these models. The best data type combinations will be summarized.</p><p>Additionally, we will conduct a comparative analysis of studies based on different data types, such as comparing the performance differences between multimodal and unimodal gait models. These differences will provide further insights into each type of model.</p><p>Furthermore, regarding the impact of data collection tasks and devices on performance, we will compile the combinations of collection tasks and devices based on the classification of each model type.

Research findings will be disseminated through manuscript submission to relevant journals. Any revisions to the study protocol will be publicly available on the OSF platform.</p><p>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is currently the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, and with the ongoing global population aging, it is expected to become a significant public health challenge in the future. As the demand for non-invasive, cost-effective, and personalized diagnostic methods increases, the use of wearable devices combined with artificial intelligence models is becoming increasingly important [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, with the introduction of the FDA&#8217;s SaMD initiative, the integration of these two technologies is becoming more feasible and moving toward commercialization [<xref rid="pone.0331129.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While predictive models using wearable devices and AI algorithms have gained popularity in recent years, their architectures and performance remain unclear. This scoping review aims to address this gap and provide critical insights into these models in the given context.</p><p>In summary, the contribution of this protocol lies not only in summarizing existing research but also in advancing the application of AI and wearable devices in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) diagnosis and management. This work fills gaps in current research and provides guidance for future studies and clinical practice. Firstly, the planned review study comparing the performance of different algorithms in AD diagnosis will offer clear directions for future research. By identifying which algorithms are more effective for specific tasks, researchers can focus on optimizing these algorithms, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and predictive capabilities. For models facing performance bottlenecks, further research could concentrate on improving model architectures or adopting new algorithmic strategies. This would not only enhance algorithm efficiency but also potentially expand their application in diagnosing other related diseases. For instance, to address the limitations of deep learning algorithms in data-scarce scenarios, future studies could explore the use of transfer learning or data augmentation techniques to improve performance on small sample datasets.</p><p>Secondly, this protocol emphasizes research on pairing wearable devices with clinical tasks, highlighting the strong correlation between devices and tasks. Future studies, based on the summary provided by the protocol, can further explore which types of tasks are best suited for pairing with specific devices, thus increasing the efficiency of clinical applications. This finding will provide valuable guidance to device developers, helping them create more precise and efficient diagnostic tools. Additionally, issues with missing data during the data collection process offer direction for improving data acquisition technologies. Future studies could explore new data collection methods and technologies, such as the integration of augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) with wearable devices, to capture richer physiological and behavioral data, thereby providing more data for early AD diagnosis.</p><p>Furthermore, by comparing models based on different collection tasks, devices, modalities, and data types, we can gain a deeper understanding of how diverse data collection methods influence model performance. Different collection tasks and devices directly impact data quality. Through the study of these diverse data collection methods, we can uncover how various factors interact synergistically, enhancing the model&#8217;s performance across different application scenarios. This is particularly relevant in the fields of healthcare and health management, providing both theoretical and practical support for optimizing existing models and developing accurate diagnostic tools.</p><p>Moreover, regarding multimodal data integration, this research will emphasize the impact of application differences and performance distributions across diverse datasets, encouraging future studies to focus on effectively combining multi-source data. For example, future studies could explore how to deeply fuse different types of data (such as behavioral data, electroencephalogram (EEG) data, and physiological signals) to further enhance diagnostic accuracy. In clinical applications, these findings will help clinicians understand the relationship between different devices, algorithms, and tasks, thereby enabling more personalized treatment plans in clinical practice.</p><p>Finally, the initiative of publicly releasing the code will serve as a bridge between the academic and clinical communities. By increasing transparency and reproducibility, researchers and clinicians will be able to more easily validate results, optimize algorithms, and customize development based on varying clinical needs. This will facilitate the deeper application of AI in healthcare, ultimately improving the diagnostic efficiency and accuracy of diseases such as AD.</p><p>Overall, conducting the further review according to this protocol not only provides strong theoretical support for technological advancements in AD diagnosis but also offers feasible pathways for optimizing clinical applications and integrating multimodal data. These findings will directly drive future research directions and help clinical practice achieve greater breakthroughs in early disease detection and personalized treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about research or publication ethics.</p><p>You may also provide optional suggestions and comments to authors that they might find helpful in planning their study.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;My concerns are as follows:</p><p>1. The abstract is overly redundant and appears to be written as an introduction; a complete rewrite of the abstract is recommended.</p><p>2. The paper explores a relatively emerging intersection of wearable devices and AI in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the existing literature on AI in healthcare, including Alzheimer's, has been growing, and the manuscript does not highlight its unique contribution clearly in the introduction. It would benefit from a clearer statement on how the review will fill existing gaps.</p><p>3. The protocol promises to synthesize a significant amount of existing research, but it remains unclear what specific contributions it will make beyond summarizing previous findings. It would be useful to further emphasize how the findings will directly influence future research directions or clinical practices. Some workss are worth mentioning: (1)DOI:10.62762/CJIF.2024.876830 (2)DOI:10.62762/TIS.2024.680959</p><p>4. The manuscript discusses the types of data (e.g., gait, EEG) that will be covered, but there is limited discussion on how diverse data collection methods could influence the model's performance. It should address how the variety of data sources will be handled, especially multimodal data.</p><p>5. What are the newly-added values?</p><p>6. The manuscript lacks a detailed discussion on the theoretical models that underpin the use of AI in AD prediction. A more comprehensive review of existing theories or frameworks (such as machine learning principles and their adaptation for healthcare applications) would strengthen the theoretical grounding.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;This is a very interesting manuscript. The use of wearable devices and the use of artificial intelligence as an intervention in the management and prevention of Alzheimer's disease is welcomed.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;Although the protocol described in this manuscript itself is well designed, it does not provide any new findings. The authors should perform a scoping review based on their own protocol and publish the results.</p><p>Reviewer #4:&#160;First off, congrats on putting together this study protocol. Now, as I was reading through, a couple of things popped up that you might want to think about a bit more:</p><p>Methods</p><p>One thing to consider clarifying is regarding the "gray literature" you plan to retrieve. Could you give a few examples of what you consider gray literature in this context? This would make your search strategy even more transparent.</p><p>You mention using the PROBAST and TRIPOD tools. It might be helpful to briefly mention what each of these tools helps you assess (e.g., risk of bias for PROBAST, reporting completeness for TRIPOD) directly in the methods section rather than just citing them.</p><p>Regarding the databases mentioned in the methodology versus the supplementary material, it's important to note that the main "Search strategy" section explicitly lists Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane Library (along with other databases) as sources that will be searched. However, in Supplementary file, which provides example search strategies for different databases, a specific search strategy for Google Scholar, Scopus, or Cochrane Library is not explicitly shown. For transparency and reproducibility, it would be beneficial for the authors to include example search strings for these databases as well in the supplementary material.</p><p>Overall, I must say that this is a very well-put-together study protocol, and I genuinely enjoyed reading it. Addressing these minor points will enhance the clarity, transparency, and rigor of your protocol. To be honest, I see significant potential for publication here if these enhancements are made. Your detailed methodology and focus on a crucial area of research make this a valuable contribution. I wish you the best of luck with your scoping review.</p><p>**********</p><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ext-link-type="uri">what does this mean?</ext-link> ).

The abstract is overly redundant and appears to be written as an introduction; a complete rewrite of the abstract is recommended.</p><p>Response to Reviewer #1's comment 1:</p><p>We appreciate your detailed comments on the abstract. Indeed, our original abstract was too lengthy, and as per your suggestion, we have rewritten it. This revision has significantly improved the clarity of the abstract. Thank you once again for your constructive feedback.</p><p>Modified content: The incidence of Alzheimer's disease continues to rise, and predictive models combining artificial intelligence (AI) with wearable devices offer a new approach for its detection and diagnosis. Given the rapid development of these emerging technologies, a comprehensive review is necessary to supplement the evidence in this field. This review aims to systematically evaluate AI-based predictive models using wearable devices, with a focus on their measurement outcomes and model development processes. Following the Arksey and O'Malley framework and incorporating PRISMA and its extension guidelines, this study will search multiple databases, including Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PubMed, covering relevant gray literature. The quality of the included studies will be rigorously assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) and Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklists. Two independent reviewers will conduct title and abstract screening, retrieve and assess full-text evidence sources, and extract data. The results will be narratively synthesized and presented in tables and figures. This review is expected to provide systematic evidence to support predictive models combining wearable devices and AI, contributing to the advancement of this field.</p><p>(Lines 26-42)</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>2. The paper explores a relatively emerging intersection of wearable devices and AI in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the existing literature on AI in healthcare, including Alzheimer's, has been growing, and the manuscript does not highlight its unique contribution clearly in the introduction. It would benefit from a clearer statement on how the review will fill existing gaps.</p><p>Response to Reviewer #1's comment 2:</p><p>We greatly appreciate your detailed and constructive feedback on our research. The previous version of the manuscript indeed lacked sufficient emphasis on how our work addresses existing research gaps. In response to your suggestion, we have revised the introduction to highlight the contributions of our study and how it fills these gaps. This addition effectively clarifies our research's unique contribution to the field.</p><p>(1)First, we have outlined the limitations of existing studies and explained how their focus differs from ours.</p><p>Modified content: The potential of these technologies is being explored; however, only two systematic reviews [19, 20] have addressed the application of wearable devices and AI models in AD. These reviews cover a broader range of topics and primarily focus on studies related to clinical biomarker data, such as radiomics. They do not provide detailed reports on the deployment strategies of wearable devices or the specifics of model construction. Additionally, these reviews fail to adequately demonstrate the feasibility of integrating wearable devices with AI technologies.</p><p>(Lines 96-102)</p><p>(2)We have also added a section outlining the contributions of our study and the gaps it addresses.</p><p>Modified content: The unique contribution of this protocol lies in its development of a systematic evaluation and comprehensive review of AI prediction models based on wearable devices. By providing a comprehensive review of existing research, it addresses the gap in the current literature concerning the integration of these two technologies. Specifically, we aim to report on several key dimensions, including the selection of wearable devices, data collection paradigms, feature selection strategies, model construction and training, model validation, and model transparency. In addition to analyzing the applications of various wearable devices, we explore how advanced AI techniques can enhance their diagnostic accuracy and monitoring capabilities. This approach offers new perspectives for the early diagnosis of AD, prediction of disease progression, and personalized healthcare.</p><p>(Lines 111-121)</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>3. The protocol promises to synthesize a significant amount of existing research, but it remains unclear what specific contributions it will make beyond summarizing previous findings. It would be useful to further emphasize how the findings will directly influence future research directions or clinical practices. Some workss are worth mentioning: (1)DOI:10.62762/CJIF.2024.876830 (2)DOI:10.62762/TIS.2024.680959</p><p>Response to Reviewer #1's comment 3:</p><p>(1)We greatly appreciate your suggestion regarding the specific contributions of our manuscript. Due to our previous unclear statement, this section was insufficient. In response to your feedback, we have made the necessary revisions. We have expanded the discussion section to include the contributions of the content we have collected to clinical practice and future research. Thank you once again for this specific and valuable suggestion, which has greatly improved the quality of our manuscript.</p><p>Modified content: Specifically, we anticipate providing a series of clinically meaningful insights. First, the summary of wearable devices and data collection paradigms will highlight the practical applications and limitations of current technologies in AD diagnosis. For instance, the pairing of different types of devices with various tasks will guide the design of clinical diversity, while the identification of causes for data gaps during the collection process will help recognize potential issues with existing data acquisition technologies. Furthermore, these insights can provide direction for future improvements in device design and data collection methods. The analysis of the quantity, types, and performance distributions of the algorithms currently in use will provide a clear representation of the field's status and development trends. By examining the application of different algorithm models and their performance across various datasets, we can identify which algorithms perform best in AD diagnosis and prediction tasks, as well as which models still face performance bottlenecks. This study will also reveal the applicability of various models in different clinical scenarios (e.g., model training costs, device portability, and data acquisition challenges), helping to identify which models are best suited for early diagnosis and disease progression tracking. Although we do not anticipate directly comparing the performance of unimodal and multimodal models, but rather presenting the performance distribution (due to the objective influences of differences in data acquisition devices, tasks, feature types, and algorithm architectures), this approach will still provide valuable insights into the combination of multimodal data. Furthermore, an analysis of external validation, calibration, and related aspects will help assess the generalizability and reliability of these models across different datasets and real-world clinical environments. The public release of code is essential for promoting transparency and reproducibility within the field. In summary, this scoping review will not only highlight the strengths of current technologies in the field of AD but will also assist researchers and clinicians in understanding the challenges that may arise in practical applications.</p><p>(Lines 398-427)</p><p>(2)The two studies you mentioned regarding EEG data processing are indeed highly relevant to the design of our protocol. In response, we have added these two studies in the introduction to enrich the theoretical background on the progress between machine learning algorithms and data processing. Your suggestion has greatly helped improve the completeness of our manuscript. Thank you once again for this constructive feedback.</p><p>Modified content: Similarly, graph neural networks play a crucial role in the spatiotemporal processing of EEG data by simultaneously considering the dynamic changes in the time series and the spatial relationships between different brain regions[17,18].</p><p>(Lines 92-95)</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>4. The manuscript discusses the types of data (e.g., gait, EEG) that will be covered, but there is limited discussion on how diverse data collection methods could influence the model's performance. It should address how the variety of data sources will be handled, especially multimodal data.</p><p>Response to Reviewer #1's comment 4:</p><p>We greatly appreciate your specific suggestions regarding the data processing of different models in our manuscript. While we had considered multimodal and different data collection, it was not sufficiently presented in the original manuscript. In response, we have added a more detailed description of the data processing in the Data Synthesis section.
