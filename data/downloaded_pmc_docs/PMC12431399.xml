On September 27, 2024, Rwanda declared its first Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak. MVD disease is a severe haemorrhagic fever with a fatality rate ranging from 24% to 90%. We describe the role played by the RFELTP in the outbreak response, and identify key strengths and challenges of the program related to the response. In November 2024, we provided a self-administered questionnaire delivered online to all residents and graduates of RFELTP. The questionnaire included sections on sociodemographic, experience in outbreak response, and MVD outbreak response experiences. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed, and the data were analysed using Stata version 16. Among the 523 total participants, 209 responded (40.0%). About a third of the participants (34.8%) supported MVD response activities. Residents and graduates supported the response in all 30 districts of Rwanda, mainly at the national and district levels. Most supported epidemiology and surveillance 41.2%, data management 19.2%, infection prevention control 14.3%, and leadership and coordination pillars 10.4%. Nearly all 96.7% felt adequately prepared by their RFELTP to handle outbreak responses. The RFELTP graduates and residents proved to be a critical resource in the MVD outbreak response, enhancing the country&#8217;s capacity to respond to public health emergencies. Continued investment in this training program is essential for enhancing global health security and strengthening capabilities to respond to public health emergencies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this article.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this article.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Rwanda Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (RFELTP) is a competency-based training program aimed at strengthening field epidemiology capacity at all levels of the health system to prevent, detect, investigate and respond to public health priority issues [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. RFELTP is led by the Government of Rwanda, with assistance from the University of Rwanda&#8217;s School of Public Health, African Field Epidemiology Network, as well as technical support and funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The program consists of three tiers: Frontline, Intermediate, and Advanced. Established in 2009, the Advanced Tier consists of both didactic components and field placements that facilitate competency development in outbreak investigation, surveillance systems, data analysis, protocol-based studies, and scientific communication. To date, the program has trained 91 field epidemiologists who are primarily deployed at the national and district levels to provide public health leadership and technical expertise. The Intermediate Tier was launched in 2022 as a nine-month training program that has a similar curriculum structure as the Advanced training, but mainly targets district-level health officials. As of December 2024, 33 Intermediate RFELTP residents have been trained. The Frontline Tier was introduced in 2020 as a three-month program, largely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It focuses on sub-national levels of the health sector and consists of three on-site training workshops, and has two field placements during which participants complete field projects in their primary work sites throughout Rwanda. Through the Frontline Tier, 399 participants have been trained, including clinical directors from hospitals, integrated disease surveillance and response officers, monitoring and evaluation officers, health promotion officers, animal resources officers and others. In total, the RFELTP has trained 523 professionals (including graduates and current residents) in field epidemiology across the three tiers (Frontline: 399, Intermediate: 33, Advanced: 91). Graduates serve at various health administrative levels in Rwanda and make up the country&#8217;s primary roster of surge staff available to respond to urgent public health situations. They have successfully completed either the advanced, intermediate or frontline training. Residents are individuals still in the RFELTP advanced, intermediate, or frontline training cohorts.</p><p>MVD is a severe and often fatal haemorrhagic fever caused by infection with the Marburg virus [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Transmission of the virus occurs through either direct or indirect contact between fruit bats and humans and through human-to-human transmission with an estimated 2&#8211;21 days incubation period [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>On 27 September 2024, Rwanda&#8217;s Ministry of Health (MoH) declared the nation&#8217;s first-ever MVD outbreak. In total, 66 cases were confirmed, including 15 deaths, resulting in a case-fatality rate of 22.7% [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. All confirmed cases were detected from the three districts in the capital, Kigali City. Kigali is characterized by its dense population and significant influx of people from various districts and foreign countries [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], creating conditions that potentially increase the risk of disease transmission. Health workers from two health facilities in Kigali, King Faisal Hospital and the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali, accounted for the majority of confirmed cases. Confirmed cases who were not healthcare workers were also linked to these health facilities [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Effectively managing an MVD outbreak requires a comprehensive strategy encompassing several key measures. These include early case identification, patient isolation and treatment, disease surveillance, systematic contact tracing and quarantine, infection prevention and control, robust laboratory diagnostic capabilities, safe and dignified burials, and effective risk communication and community engagement [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The effectiveness of these interventions depends on a well-trained public health workforce [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The World Health Organisation (WHO) also recognizes a strong public health workforce as critical to compliance with the 2005 International Health Regulations [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>We aimed to describe the role of RFELTP graduates and residents in response to the MVD outbreak in Rwanda from September to mid-November 2024, and identify key strengths and challenges of the program related to the response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The information reported in this article represents data collected during the MVD outbreak response. An outbreak investigation is regarded as an emergency activity and was endorsed by MOH. Permission to collect and publish this information was sought and granted by the Research, Innovation and Data Science (RIDS) Division in Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC). In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, participation in the survey was voluntary, and informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to completing the survey. At the start of the online questionnaire, participants were presented with an informed consent and the participant checked the &#8220;I agree&#8221; box to indicate consent before proceeding to the questionnaire. To maintain the confidentiality of respondents, strict measures were implemented to safeguard participant data. During the data collection phase, all personal identifying information was anonymized.</p><p>We described the roles of RFELTP graduates and residents in the MVD response to illustrate their engagement and extent of their support during this emergency response. A complete list of all 523 graduates and residents from the Advanced, Intermediate, and Frontline RFELTP tiers was obtained from the University of Rwanda and Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC), which oversees the RFELTP program. The RFELTP program administrators, who also served in leadership roles in MVD outbreak response, provided qualitative data on the timeline of response and mobilization efforts to engage the RFELTP graduates and residents in the response.</p><p>From 1<sup>st</sup> to 30<sup>th</sup> November 2024, we conducted an online survey using a questionnaire designed through the Kobo Toolbox platform [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The questionnaire was first piloted by administering it to five people who are among the study participants to assess its clarity, relevance, and ease of understanding before final distribution. All 523 graduates and residents were contacted through phone calls and emails to participate in the online survey.

id="sec006"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study describes the role of RFELTP graduates and residents during the 2024 Rwanda MVD outbreak. The swift mobilization and deployment of these trained epidemiologists, representing diverse professional backgrounds and geographic locations, underscores the importance of having a well-trained public health workforce. Their comprehensive support primarily focused on key areas such as epidemiology, data management, infection prevention and control, and leadership. The extensive training initiatives facilitated by RFELTP were wide-reaching and essential to the response. Without RFELTP, this considerable group of trained individuals would not have been available to enhance Rwanda&#8217;s capacity to respond effectively to this public health emergency.</p><p>Survey respondents identified key strengths of RFELTP graduates and residents, such as case investigation, contact tracing, surveillance analysis, and community engagement. These competencies were instrumental in the effective management of the MVD outbreak, particularly in areas such as surveillance and case investigation, where RFELTP teams established a strong reporting mechanism, successfully identified all contacts, tracked the index case, and mapped high-risk groups [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These areas of engagement align with the core competencies of the RFELTP, which emphasize data-driven outbreak investigation and management [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and are similar to engagement in previous success stories that other Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs) worldwide have demonstrated in fulfilling similar roles during significant outbreaks. For example, FETPs in Liberia proved effective in managing Ebola virus outbreaks through robust case investigation and contact tracing initiatives [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and in the 2023 MVD outbreak in Tanzania by providing support in surveillance and contact tracing [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>While most of the advanced tier graduates and residents provided support in Kigali City where all confirmed MVD cases were detected [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], other graduates and residents provided response support in all 30 districts of the country, including at their respective workplaces. This geographical distribution of RFELTP graduates and residents enabled localized interventions that were tailored to the specific needs of communities, including the training of more than 245,000 individuals across the country. The RFELTP team&#8217;s role in door-to-door screening and community education aimed to combat inaccuracies in circulating information and build community trust in managing transmission risks. These efforts highlight the benefits of having a three-tiered program that trains individuals at all levels of the health sector to provide support not only at the national level, but in the field and on the ground for enhanced implementation of interventions.</p><p>The participants reported high confidence in their RFELTP training to handle the outbreak response with many assuming leadership and coordination roles. RFELTP residents and graduates served as national leads of the surveillance pillar, partner coordination pillar, case investigation team, and contact follow-up team. At the district level, they served as case investigation, infection prevention and control, and laboratory team leads. This high level of reported confidence in their training preparedness and their representation in the response in leadership positions suggests that the program is achieving one of its primary objectives, to effectively build capacity to respond to public health emergencies [<xref rid="pgph.0004452.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Despite the demonstrated strengths of the RFELTP program, participants identified areas for future improvement in the RFELTP curriculum, including advanced data analysis skills, enhanced risk communication in outbreak settings, and mental health and resilience training. These suggestions indicate opportunities for improving the RFELTP curriculum to further strengthen outbreak response capabilities.</p><p>This study has several limitations. The use of self-reported data and the provision of phone guidance by the research team may introduce the possibility of response bias and limit the generalizability of the findings. However, the phone support was solely intended to ensure participants fully understood the questions, in order for them to complete the survey. Additionally, the study was conducted within a short time frame of three months, which may not capture the full complexity of the outbreak response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec007"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings emphasize the essential role of structured field epidemiology training programs like RFELTP in coordinated responses to emerging infectious disease threats. The multidisciplinary approach demonstrated by RFELTP graduates and residents provide a model for building resilient public health systems. The RFELTP has proven to be a valuable resource in outbreak response, producing well-trained, adaptable professionals capable of managing complex public health emergencies.
