The acquisition protocols were: tube voltage, 120&#160;kVp; tube current, automatically adjusted (Volume EC); detector collimation, 0.25&#215;0.25&#160;mm (super high-resolution mode) for HRCT and 0.5&#215;0.5&#160;mm for conventional CT; gantry rotation time, 0.75 seconds/rotation; field of view, 400&#160;mm; slice thickness, 0.5&#160;mm; and a preset noise index of 15&#160;HU. After acquiring non&#8211;contrast-enhanced images, an iodinated contrast agent (600&#160;mgI/kg of body weight) was injected with a fixed 30-second injection duration. Images were subsequently acquired at 50 and 80 seconds of scan delay.

However, in both univariate and multivariable regression analyses, the use of HRCT was not an independent predictor. Only heterogenous enhancement with a high attenuation bolus of the IVC corresponding to the peak enhancement was an independent predictor of good RAV detectability.</p><p>HRCT has demonstrated improved visualization of cranial lenticulostriate arteries,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> spinal Adamkiewicz artery,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> coronary artery,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and small visceral arteries.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In phantom studies, HRCT also showed superior detectability of simulated small-caliber arteries as compared with conventional CT,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> with small-caliber vessels filled with iodine contrast agents. While previous studies targeted arteries, which are easily enhanced, our study focused on small veins. Based on previous reports of HRCT&#8217;s superior detectability for high-contrast objects and our current results, UHRCT can be able to provide superior detectability only when the object shows high attenuation. Good detectability of HRCT requires adequate enhancement of the target vessels.</p><p>Adequate contrast enhancement of RAV can be achieved when the CT is acquired at an optimal time window that matches the peak enhancement of RAV. Although detailed TIC data of RAV has not been reported, it is reasonable to assume that an enhancement pattern of RAV is similar to that of the IVC at the adrenal gland levels. In our analysis of TIC of IVC, peak enhancement occurred 50 seconds after the start of contrast injection, when a bolus of contrast agent backed from the kidney entered the IVC and mixed with noncontrasted blood, creating a heterogenous enhancement pattern. Heterogenous enhancement pattern of the IVC was associated with good RAV detectability in our regression analysis, highlighting the importance of adequate enhancement for detecting small veins, even with HRCT.</p><p>The proportion of good detectability in our study, 42% (15/36), was lower than in previous reports,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> where a bolus tracking technique was used to capture adequate enhancement of RAV, resulting in an excellent detection rate of RAV (78% to 93%) in the late arterial phase images. This discrepancy may be due to differences in qualitative evaluation criteria and imaging methods.</p><p>High-resolution can be also achieved with state-of-the-art photon counting CT, which is expected to lead to improvements in spatial resolution and image quality in the future. Our findings suggest that optimal acquisition timing is crucial for achieving improved visualization of small veins even in the era of photon counting CT.</p><p>We hypothesized that an anatomic variant of the RAV, a common trunk with the hepatic accessory vein, would contribute to the poor detectability of the RAV due to its small vessel diameter and complex anatomy. However, this factor did not show a significant impact, likely due to the limited number of patients with variant RAV in this study. In addition, the close contact between the right adrenal gland and the IVC without interposing fat tissue may also hinder RAV detectability. This is because the short distance between the right adrenal gland and the IVC, coupled with poor contrast against adipose tissue, makes the RAV harder to identify. While this factor may influence RAV detectability to some degree, optimal acquisition timing is a much more critical factor in ensuring the effective visualization of the RAV.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, this is a single-center retrospective study with a limited sample size, which introduces sampling bias and reduces statistical power. Further large-scale studies are needed. Second, our CT acquisition protocol using a fixed scan delay may miss the optimal scan timing. The use of a bolus tracking technique will be appropriate.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Although a subanalysis restricted to cases with adequate acquisition timing might provide more reliable insight, the small sample size of such cases (n=10 vs. n=6 of heterogenous enhancement pattern of the IVC) limits the robustness of the statistical analysis. Third, our dichotomized qualitative image assessment may either overestimate or underestimate subtle and ambiguous findings. Lastly, in addition to factors in our regression analysis, there may be other intrinsic and uncontrollable factors that could potentially affect RAV detectability.</p><p>In conclusion, although this was a retrospective small study, the simple use of high-resolution 0.25&#160;mm detector matrix CT did not immediately improve the detection of RAV in a preprocedure CT for AVS. Optimal acquisition timing of the targeted venous structure is essential for achieving good detectability.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>The author declares no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Siddiqui</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Calhoun</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>. <article-title>The unrecognized prevalence of primary aldosteronism: a cross-sectional study</article-title>. <source>Ann Intern Med</source>. <year>2020</year>;<volume>173</volume>:<fpage>10</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>20</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32449886</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi" assigning-authority="pmc">10.7326/M20-0065</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC7459427</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Monticone</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Burrello</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Tizzani</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>. <article-title>Prevalence and clinical manifestations of primary aldosteronism encountered in primary care practice</article-title>. <source>J Am Coll Cardiol</source>. <year>2017</year>;<volume>69</volume>:<fpage>1811</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>1820</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">28385310</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi" assigning-authority="pmc">10.1016/j.jacc.2017.01.052</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="R3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Funder</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Carey</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Mantero</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>. <article-title>The management of primary aldosteronism: case detection, diagnosis, and treatment: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline</article-title>. <source>J Clin Endocrinol Metab</source>. <year>2016</year>;<volume>101</volume>:<fpage>1889</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>1916</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26934393</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi" assigning-authority="pmc">10.1210/jc.2015-4061</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="R4"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Araki</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Okada</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Onishi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group>. <article-title>Does catheter shape influence the success of right adrenal venous sampling?
