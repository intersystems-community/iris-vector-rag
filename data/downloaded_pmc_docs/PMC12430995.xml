Lime stabilization is one of the most widely used methods for improving such soils. However, lime addition may cause brittleness of these soils, resulting in a sudden loss of strength. To overcome this weakness, this study investigated using polypropylene fibers in combination with lime stabilization. Accordingly, the plasticity, compressibility, and strength properties of soil mixtures containing 3%, 6%, 9%, and 12% lime, along with mixtures prepared with a constant 0.5% polypropylene fiber content, were systematically evaluated in a laboratory environment. Additionally, the influence of freeze&#8211;thaw cycles (FTCs), which induce long-term strength degradation in highway subgrades, on these mixtures was investigated. The results indicated that lime addition reduced the plasticity index by up to 38% without causing a significant change in dry unit weight. It was also determined that FTCs could lead to a strength loss of up to 84% in natural soil, and this loss was substantially reduced by adding lime and fibers. These findings highlight that the lime-fiber combination represents an effective and sustainable method for increasing the performance of high-plasticity soils.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>soils stabilization</kwd><kwd>lime</kwd><kwd>polypropylene fiber</kwd><kwd>freeze&#8211;thaw cycles</kwd><kwd>shear strength</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-polymers-17-02405"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The environmental impact of road construction on ecosystems is harmful, mainly because it requires large amounts of mineral materials to construct granular base and sub-base layers and create suitable subgrades. Since weak subgrades require making highway pavement layers thicker, it increases pavement construction costs and the negative impact of road construction on the natural environment. When the characteristics of natural subgrades are not suitable for road construction, suitable materials need to be obtained from nearby rivers or surrounding borrowing areas. Instead of using borrowed materials, improving these subgrades to meet the desired performance criteria can be more economical. Furthermore, improving existing subgrades minimizes environmental impacts by reducing the need for excavation and backfilling.</p><p>Improving highway subgrades involves rehabilitating existing soil properties through physical and/or chemical methods to increase the road infrastructure&#8217;s bearing capacity, durability, and longevity. This process aims to make soils with weak or insufficient bearing capacity suitable for road construction.</p><p>The subgrade is the lowest layer that the highway pavement directly contacts and it carries the load. Due to a weak subgrade, collapses, cracks, deformations, and deterioration of the road surface may occur over time. Therefore, soil improvement is carried out to increase the soil&#8217;s bearing capacity, reduce volume changes, and enhance its resistance to water. The soil improvement method to be applied depends on the soil type, moisture status, loading conditions, and economic criteria. The methods used in soil improvement can be grouped under two headings: mechanical and chemical improvement methods. These two methods can be used independently or in combination to improve the properties of a subgrade from various perspectives.</p><p>Mechanical improvement methods are processes in which the physical properties of the soil are modified without changing its chemistry. In these methods, soil improvement is achieved by changing the physical structure of natural soil particles through vibration or compaction, or by adding other objects such as barriers and nails to the soil structure. Mechanical improvement methods also involve mixing and compacting the subgrade with other materials of varying grain sizes in specific proportions, resulting in a final mixture with the targeted grain distribution. Finally, reinforcing the soil using synthetic or natural additives to improve the properties of the subgrade is also one of the mechanical improvement methods. Adding randomly distributed fibers with high tensile strength to the soil prevents erosion and settlement and increases the shear strength of the subgrade.</p><p>Chemical improvement or stabilization is achieved by changing the chemical structure of the soil by adding various additives, such as fly ash, lime, cement, or polymer, to the subgrade. These substances react chemically with the soil and increase its bearing capacity, water resistance, and durability. In addition, the purpose of chemical stabilization of soils is to ensure cementation by increasing the size of the grains in the soil material, reducing the plasticity index and swelling-shrinkage potential, and increasing their stability. Chemical stabilization of soils is a practical, long-lasting, and permanent method. It is often cost effective because the amount of chemical additives required for effective stabilization is small. This method is also compatible with most soil types and allows the reuse of industrial by-products as chemical additives.</p><p>Lime is one of the most commonly used additives in highway pavements. Because it is economical and straightforward to apply, it is widely used in foundations, embankments, and other soil structures [<xref rid="B1-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Lime stabilization provides effective results, especially in high-plasticity clays that contain enough silica and alumina to react chemically with lime. Additionally, clayey gravels and silty clays react readily with lime. On the other hand, lime stabilization will not yield the desired results in granular, low-cohesion, or cohesionless soils without the addition of pozzolan.</p><p>Some studies have reported that lime does not significantly affect compaction parameters. However, lime undergoes a rapid and extensive chemical reaction with soil particles compared to other binders. Changing the characteristics of the soil through chemical interaction improves the soil&#8217;s various properties, such as compression and strength parameters [<xref rid="B2-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Within the scope of lime stabilization, Kavak and Akyarl&#305; (2007) [<xref rid="B2-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] evaluated the improvement obtained due to lime stabilization applied to a road section dominated by green and brown clays. Adding 5% lime to both clays achieved lime stabilization under field conditions. California bearing ratio (CBR) tests in the laboratory showed increases of up to 16 and 21 times in green and brown clays, respectively, compared to initial CBR values after 28 days.</p><p>In some studies, sewage sludge ash was used in addition to lime to stabilize cohesive soils. In such a study conducted by Lin et al. (2007) [<xref rid="B5-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], five different ratios of sludge ash to slaked lime, 0%, 2%, 4%, 8%, and 16% by weight, were mixed with cohesive soil, and their effects on the soil were investigated. The experimental findings revealed that the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of samples containing additives was enhanced three to seven times compared to untreated soil. The triaxial compression test results also showed that cohesion increased with increasing additive amount.</p><p>Sobhan and Mashnad (2002) [<xref rid="B6-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that chemical stabilization significantly increased the compressive strength of the soil but made little contribution to the tensile strength. This issue becomes a significant problem when a shrinkage crack occurs in soil. Accordingly, improving the tensile strength, ductility, and toughness of lime-treated soil through fiber reinforcement becomes essential.</p><p>In this context, synthetic and natural fibers are widely used to improve subgrades [<xref rid="B7-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mohammed et al. (2022) [<xref rid="B9-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] evaluated the strength properties of a problematic soil by reinforcing the soil sample with sisal fibers. To obtain and assess various parameters, samples containing sisal fibers at 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2% by dry weight of the soil and with fiber lengths of 10, 15, and 20 mm were prepared and subjected to compression, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), and soaked CBR tests. The study demonstrated that increasing the fiber content and length caused a slight reduction in the maximum dry density of the reinforced soil. On the other hand, the optimum moisture content showed a moderate increase. In addition, notable increases in the UCS and CBR were observed as the fiber length and content were increased.</p><p>Synthetic fibers have been used to reinforce soils for nearly forty years. Polypropylene fibers, which are utilized to improve soil strength and reduce shrinkage, are the most commonly used additive in soil reinforcement. According to Puppala and Musenda (2000) [<xref rid="B10-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], reinforcing soil with polypropylene fibers enhances the soil&#8217;s UCS and decreases the volumetric shrinkage strain and swelling pressure in expansive clays. In another study conducted by Abd Al-Kaream et al. (2022) [<xref rid="B11-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], experiments were performed on clay soil containing polypropylene fibers in amounts ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, and it was observed that polypropylene fibers increased the liquid and plastic limits, as well as the UCS. The compression index decreased by 69% and the swelling index decreased by 78%. As the percentage of polypropylene fibers increased, the specific gravity and maximum dry unit weight decreased.</p><p>Apart from polypropylene fibers, synthetic fibers made from other materials, such as polyester, polyethylene, glass, and nylon, are also used to reinforce floors [<xref rid="B12-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Kumar et al. (2006) [<xref rid="B14-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] conducted UCS tests on clay samples reinforced with straight and crimped polyester fibers at fiber contents of 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0%. The study&#8217;s findings indicated that the UCS increased with increasing fiber length and/or fiber content.</p><p>A review of existing studies on fiber-reinforced lime-treated soils indicates that incorporating fibers can mitigate the brittle fracture typically encountered with lime stabilization [<xref rid="B15-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this context, Cai et al. (2006) [<xref rid="B15-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] carried out a study to investigate the influence of lime and polypropylene fibers on the engineering characteristics of soft soil. The study demonstrated that adding fibers to lime-stabilized soil enhanced its UCS and shear strength parameters. Consoli et al. (2012) [<xref rid="B16-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] indicated that porosity, fiber content, and lime content are effective variables for improving lime and fiber-stabilized soil&#8217;s compressive and tensile strength.</p><p>One crucial issue to consider in pavement design is the behavior of stabilized clay soils under freeze&#8211;thaw conditions. Freezing and thawing cycles weaken the soil structure and reduce the performance of pavement materials, causing microcracks in compacted soils. It is known that pavements exposed to frost effects have shorter service lives compared to those not exposed to the same impact [<xref rid="B19-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Guney et al. (2006) [<xref rid="B20-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] emphasized that the stable material obtained must resist additional stresses arising from freeze&#8211;thaw cycles (FTCs) in every application related to soil stabilization.</p><p>Hotineanua et al. (2015) [<xref rid="B21-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] studied the effect of FTCs on the mechanical properties of two types of plastic soils stabilized with lime. Their research investigated two types of clay soils, low-plasticity kaolinite and high-plasticity bentonite, under untreated and lime-stabilized states for curing durations of up to 300 days. The findings indicated that the volume of stabilized soils increased during early FTCs, but this growth became less significant in subsequent cycles. The UCS increased significantly as the curing period was prolonged from 3 to 28 days, up to 300 days. Following exposure to freeze&#8211;thaw conditions, cracks caused by ice lens formation within the pores of lime-stabilized soil samples were found to have a greater effect on bentonite soil than kaolinite soil.</p><p>There are limited studies on the freeze&#8211;thaw behavior of fiber-reinforced soils [<xref rid="B22-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this regard, Liu et al. (2020) [<xref rid="B23-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] examined the impact of FTCs on the strength of soil reinforced with natural fibers. For this purpose, single fiber tensile tests, unconfined compression tests, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were conducted on soil reinforced with cotton straw fibers subjected to 0, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 freezing and thawing cycles. The UCS of the soil reinforced with fibers declined exponentially as the number of FTCs increased. The reduction in UCS of fiber-reinforced soil under freeze&#8211;thaw conditions was smaller than the strength loss occurring at the fiber&#8211;soil interface, as reinforcement performance depends both on fiber&#8211;soil interaction and the spatial stress network generated by the fibers. SEM observations also confirmed the existence of an intricate spatial stress system, which enhances fiber reinforcement after FTCs. In another study, Ardakani and Aliaghaei (2025) [<xref rid="B24-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] investigated the effectiveness of adding carbon fibers to clay soil to improve its performance during FTCs. Carbon fiber was mixed with clay at proportions ranging from 0.1% to 0.4% by weight of dry soil. Dynamic tests were performed on unreinforced and reinforced samples after exposure to 0, 3, 6, and 9 FTCs under 100 kPa and 300 kPa confining pressures. The findings revealed that adding carbon fibers increased both the shear modulus and damping ratio.</p><p>Boz and Sezer (2018) [<xref rid="B25-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] conducted a comparative investigation into the effects of FTCs on lime-stabilized clay soil reinforced with polypropylene and basalt fibers. Soil specimens reinforced with 12 mm long polypropylene and basalt fibers at weight fractions of 0%, 0.5%, and 1% were compacted utilizing standard Proctor compaction energy, applied at the corresponding optimum moisture contents. For comparison, certain fiber-clay mixtures were stabilized with 3% lime, while others remained unstabilized. All samples were cured for 28 days in a humid chamber at an average temperature of 20 &#176;C, after which they were subjected to freeze&#8211;thaw testing for 0, 1, 3, 7, and 10 cycles. A series of unconfined compression and ultrasonic pulse velocity tests was conducted, demonstrating that an increase in FTCs decreased the UCS and ultrasonic pulse velocity across all tested samples. Additionally, mass loss was significant in samples subjected to freeze&#8211;thaw cycles. Polypropylene fibers were more effective against freeze&#8211;thaw cycles than basalt fibers in terms of freeze&#8211;thaw resistance.</p><p>In this study, changes in the engineering properties of soils stabilized with different proportions of lime (3%, 6%, 9%, and 12%) and a constant proportion of polypropylene fibers (0.5%) were experimentally investigated for the improvement of high-plasticity highway subgrades. In this context, the stabilized soil sample properties, such as plasticity, compressibility, and shear strength, were evaluated. Furthermore, in this study, where lime and polypropylene fiber additives were used together, the effects of different curing times (uncured, 1, and 28 days) and 28-day FTCs consisting of 12 h cycles on the UCS of the soils were investigated in detail. Based on the findings, the optimum lime additive ratio that would maintain long-term resistance against FTCs was determined for both fibrous and fiberless conditions, and recommendations were presented to enhance the sustainability of road pavement performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="sec2-polymers-17-02405"><title>2.

High-Plasticity Subgrade Soil</title><p>The subgrade used in this study was a high-plasticity clay soil obtained locally from K&#252;tahya. The natural water content of the subgrade soil (w) was around 22%, which varied depending on seasonal differences. Soil samples were obtained 1&#8211;2 m below the surface and dried in an oven at 105 &#176;C before being blended and homogenized. Sieve and hydrometer analysis, Atterberg limits, and specific gravity tests were carried out to determine the physical characteristics of the natural soil, and the results are shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-02405-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The specific gravity of the natural soil was 2.7. Based on the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) soil classification system, it was classified as an A-7-5 clayey soil, which is generally regarded as having moderate to poor suitability for road infrastructure applications. According to the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS), the soil belonged to the MH group, comprising high-plasticity inorganic silts and clayey silts.</p><p>To assess the grain size distribution of the natural soil, the wet analysis method specified in ASTM D1140-00 (2006) [<xref rid="B26-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was employed to separate fine-grained soils smaller than 75 &#181;m (No. 200 sieve) from coarse-grained soils.

In the XRD analysis, sharp peaks on the 2-theta axis indicated certain crystal structures. The very sharp peak at 26.6&#176; indicated the quartz phase, and this result was confirmed by 54.72% SiO<sub>2</sub>, the most dominant oxide in the XRF analysis. In the XRF analysis, %15.27 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + %1.59 K<sub>2</sub>O + %2.76 MgO indicated clay minerals. This result, along with small peaks around 19&#8211;25&#176; and 35&#176; in the XRD analysis, confirmed the presence of clay minerals such as illite, kaolinite, and muscovite. Despite the high iron content of 8.01% in the XRF analysis, no distinct hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) peak was visible in the XRD analysis.

The increase in dry unit weight could be attributed to the relatively finer particle size of lime compared to the natural soil, which reduced the void ratio by occupying the pore spaces within the soil matrix.

If the lime concentration in the mixture exceeded the optimum level, the dry unit weight value decreased because lime particles with relatively low specific gravity replaced a particular volume of soil particles. At the same time, lime caused particles to clump and occupy larger volumes due to the cation exchange reaction, which changed the compaction characteristics of the soil. The increase in the optimum water content due to increased lime content was likely due to the high water retention of lime.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-polymers-17-02405"><title>3.3. Shear Strength</title><p>The natural soil and its lime-stabilized mixtures were prepared at their respective optimum moisture contents, which were determined individually through compaction tests. Then, the samples were placed in a stainless steel mold with a diameter of 50 mm (<xref rid="polymers-17-02405-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>A) and compressed statically with the help of a piston pushed at a constant speed with the help of a hydraulic jack (<xref rid="polymers-17-02405-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>B) to obtain the samples for which the shear strength parameters would be determined. The preparation of unconfined compression samples by the static compression method is shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-02405-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>. In the standard compaction method, when a sample is compressed in three layers, the formation of shear planes between the layers can affect the strength of each sample at different levels. Therefore, the static compression method was adopted in this study. In the static compaction method, the wet soil mass with the optimum water content that will fill the sample volume of standard dimensions after compaction is determined and the sample is placed in the compaction mold. Thus, by applying standard compaction energy in the compaction test, samples with the same void ratio and dry unit volume weight as the compressed sample can be obtained. Unconfined compression tests were conducted on the prepared soil samples following ASTM D2166-06 [<xref rid="B34-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and their strength characteristics were subsequently evaluated. The changes in shear strength of the subgrade soil stabilized with different proportions of lime are shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-02405-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p>The change in the UCS of soil samples stabilized with lime addition was determined by gradually increasing the lime addition at rates between 3% and 12% with 0, 1, and 28 days of curing. When the strength properties of the lime-added samples were examined immediately after preparation without being exposed to curing conditions (<xref rid="polymers-17-02405-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>), it was determined that gradually increasing the lime addition at rates varying between 3% and 12% increased the strength at rates ranging between 55.7% and 62.6%. According to the results obtained, although the strength properties increased depending on the increase in the lime percentage of the mixture, the difference in strength between the lowest and highest lime percentage was 4.5%. This result showed that obtaining sufficient efficiency from the additive in the chemical stabilization method with lime depended on completing pozzolanic reactions between the lime and the soil and providing appropriate curing conditions and sufficient time for these to occur. For this purpose, samples containing lime were prepared at the same mixing ratios and stored under ideal curing conditions at constant room temperature (20 &#176;C) for 1 and 28 days without changing the water content to determine the UCS. The results obtained are presented in <xref rid="polymers-17-02405-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> and <xref rid="polymers-17-02405-f011" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>, respectively.</p><p>When the results were examined, it was determined that the strength increased by approximately 50% in the case of only one day of curing, even when no additives were added to the subgrade. It was thought that the most important reason for this increase was due to the pozzolanic reactions that occurred when the 4.12% quicklime (CaO) in the natural soil absorbed the moisture in the environment under curing conditions. When the strength of the one-day cured sample without an additive and the sample with 3% lime additive were compared, it was determined that there was a 15% increase, and when the lime additive contents were 6% and 12%, these increases were 224% and 349%, respectively.</p><p>It was observed that the differences between the shear strengths of the 28-day cured samples with different amounts of lime added increased significantly. While the shear strength of the 3% added sample increased by 94%, the shear strength of the 12% added sample increased by 1063%.</p><p>When the curing effect was examined based on the changing lime percentage, it was determined that the shear strength obtained in the 28-day cured condition in samples containing 3% lime increased by 73% compared to the uncured condition. These increases were 272% and 561% at increasing lime mixture ratios (6% and 9%), while it reached 891% at the highest lime mixture ratio of 12%.</p><p>Kavak and Baykal (2012) [<xref rid="B35-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] investigated the changes in the microstructure of kaolinite cured for a long time and stabilized with lime. Unconfined compression test samples with 4% and 12% lime content by weight were prepared and hardened in a humidity chamber for curing. Firstly, the UCS of pure kaolinite was found to be 125 kPa. This value increased to 1015 kPa after one month and 2640 kPa after 10 months for the cured and lime-stabilized samples. Similar strength increases were observed for kaolinite stabilized with 12% lime, consistent with the strength increases determined in this study.</p><p>The strengthening mechanism that increases soil strength in lime stabilization applications occurs in two ways. The first of these mechanisms is ion exchange, which has a short-term effect. In ion exchange, weakly bonded cations such as sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) found on the surface of clay soils are replaced by calcium (Ca<sup>+</sup>) ions in the lime. As a result, interparticle bonds are strengthened, increasing the soil&#8217;s cohesion and thus its shear strength. The increase in shear strength of the uncured soil samples in the graph shown in <xref rid="polymers-17-02405-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> was thought to occur in this way. The second mechanism is pozzolanic reactions, which have a long-term effect. Pozzolanic reactions are time dependent and, during this stage, lime reacts with silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in the clay minerals. As a result, calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and calcium aluminate hydrate (C-A-H) compounds are formed. Cementation occurring between soil particles significantly increases strength while reducing water permeability. Pozzolanic reactions are generally known to begin after 24 h, and this mechanism was thought to be responsible for the increase in shear strength seen in <xref rid="polymers-17-02405-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> and <xref rid="polymers-17-02405-f011" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>.</p><p>While the axial deformation percentage of the natural soil at the time of collapse was around 7%, this value gradually decreased to 2% and then to 1% with increased lime ratio in the mixture and the curing time. This result showed that the lime addition reduced the ductility of the material under load and caused it to exhibit brittle behavior. Studies on lime-stabilized samples in the literature also identified a shear failure mode similar to that observed in brittle materials [<xref rid="B4-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-polymers-17-02405" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

While a compact internal structure was formed due to this change, there were also pore structures with sizes ranging from 2.9 to 5.7 &#956;m.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-polymers-17-02405"><title>3.4. Evaluation of the Mechanical Strength of Polypropylene Fiber-Reinforced Soil Mixtures</title><p>High-plasticity subgrades exhibit shrinkage behavior depending on the change in water content, and they lose a significant amount of their strength at high water contents. Highway pavements located on such soils face serious risks. The use of polypropylene fibers and other stabilizing agents in improving the engineering properties of high-plasticity subgrades is becoming increasingly widespread due to the low price and easy availability of these materials. In addition to the fibers having high chemical and biological degradation resistance, they improve many engineering properties of the soils, especially the bearing capacity, since they are a material with high tensile strength. In this experimental study, synthetic fibers with a length of 12 mm at a rate of 0.5% by dry weight were mixed with natural and lime-stabilized subgrades, and the effect of fiber addition on the strength properties of these mixtures was investigated. To ensure homogeneous distribution of the synthetic fibers within the soil, before mixing with the soil, compressed air was applied in a closed chamber to separate the fibers from each other, which were then mixed with the soil in dry form. <xref rid="polymers-17-02405-f013" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref> and <xref rid="polymers-17-02405-f014" ref-type="fig">Figure 14</xref> illustrate the variation in shear strength of the subgrade stabilized with different lime contents and 0.5% fibers after curing periods of 1 day and 28 days, respectively.</p><p>While the strength of the natural soil increased by 124% when only 0.5% fiber was added and it was exposed to one day of curing, there was a 50% increase in strength due to fiber addition alone, independent of the curing effect.

Freeze&#8211;Thaw Durability Performance of Stabilized Soil Mixtures</title><p>Loss of stability of high-plasticity soils exposed to FTCs in cold climate regions is a significant engineering problem. At low temperatures, the freezing of water in the soil results in an increase in volume and swelling, and during thawing, an increase in the soil water content and softening of the soil occur.

Soil improvement methods generally aim to increase the soil bearing capacity, reduce settlement, and improve water resistance by reducing plasticity and volumetric change potential.</p><p>For this purpose, lime was mixed homogeneously with natural soil at different mixing ratios (3, 6, 9, and 12%) by dry mass, and the changes in compaction characteristics, such as consistency limits, optimum water content, and maximum dry unit weight, and engineering properties such as the UCS were investigated. In addition, 12 mm long polypropylene fibers were added to natural and lime-stabilized subgrade soils at 0.5%. The change in the shear strength of the subgrade soil exposed to different curing times and FTCs was then determined.</p><p>As the percentage of lime added to a high-plasticity subgrade increased, the liquid limit decreased by 4.7&#8211;25%, the plasticity index decreased by 4.9&#8211;38.1%, and the soil gradually departed from plastic behavior. Furthermore, when examining the effect of lime stabilization on the optimum water content and maximum dry unit weight values, it was observed that increasing the lime addition to the mixture up to 6% caused a 3% decrease in the optimum water content, while expanding the lime addition to 12% resulted in an increase in the optimum water content, reaching levels similar to those obtained for natural soil. Depending on the lime addition rate, the maximum dry unit weight value varied within a limited range, inversely proportional to the optimum water content.</p><p>When the strength characteristics of the subgrade soil and lime-stabilized mixtures were examined under uncured, 1-, and 28-day cured conditions, the shear strength of the soil stabilized with 3&#8211;12% lime increased by 56&#8211;63% under uncured conditions, while these increases were at the levels of 72&#8211;571% and 169&#8211;1511% under 1- and 28-day cured conditions, respectively. This result demonstrates the importance of preserving the sample for a sufficient curing period for pozzolanic reactions and strength gains in the lime stabilization method. Furthermore, the axial strain percentage of the lime-stabilized soil decreased significantly, indicating brittle behavior.</p><p>While 0.5% polypropylene fiber additive provided an increase of up to 90% in natural soil with lower strength, the higher strength of lime-stabilized mixtures reduced the strength-increasing effect of the fiber additive. As the fibers increased the strength by 79% in the soil stabilized with 3% lime, this increase decreased to 1.5% when the lime ratio in the mixture reached 12%. Mixing fibers with soil offers numerous benefits, including reduced soil brittleness, increased shear, compressive, and tensile strengths, and reduced swelling. The mechanical adhesion of fibers to the soil matrix positively affects deformation behavior and increases ductility. Furthermore, using fiber additive can reduce the amount of agent used in chemical stabilization, providing an environmentally friendly improvement.</p><p>When the effect of FTCs on the strength properties of the soil mixtures was examined, the strength loss caused by FTCs in natural soil with and without fiber additive reached up to 84%. Even though FTCs typically reduce the shear strength of soil samples, a significant increase in shear strength was observed in lime-stabilized samples compared to natural soil, attributed to pozzolanic reactions occurring under curing conditions. Although the strength loss caused by FTCs in the soil stabilized with 12% lime was 64%, the strength value of this soil was 2434% higher than the strength value of natural soil exposed to FTCs.</p><p>In cold climates, FTCs are the most critical factor affecting the long-term performance of road pavements. In subgrades stabilized with lime and synthetic fibers, strength losses caused by FTCs can be minimized, and the strength can even be increased. Furthermore, by improving the soil&#8217;s plasticity, volumetric changes resulting from changes in water content can be controlled, and long-term stability can be achieved.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
