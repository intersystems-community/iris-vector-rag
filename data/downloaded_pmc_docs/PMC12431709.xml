The lump was associated with purulent and foul-smelling discharge. Mild bleeding from the nipple was present, which was not associated with pain and fever. Physical examination revealed bilateral breasts at the same level, with no abnormalities detected in the left breast. The right breast exhibited a nontender lump measuring 4 cm &#215; 5 cm in the upper outer quadrant behind the nipple-areolar complex. The lump was associated with excoriation of the skin and nipple retraction. The skin over the swelling was adhered to, and no active bleeding was observed. Palpation of the right axilla revealed palpable lymphadenopathy.</p><p>Ultrasound examination of both breasts indicated an abscess in the right breast with concurrent right axillary lymphadenopathy. The left breast exhibited a small, well-defined oval cyst, suggesting a benign lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging of the breasts revealed a large ulcerative, irregular heterogeneous mass diffusely involving the right breast with irregular margins and heterogeneous enhancement, consistent with breast cancer (American collage of radiology, breast imaging reporting and data system). The left breast showed a well-defined oval cyst suggestive of a benign lesion (ACR BIRADS 2). Positron emission tomography computed tomography scan demonstrated a hypermetabolic mass lesion predominantly involving the right breast outer quadrant, indicative of primary malignancy.</p><p>Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the right breast lump and axillary lymph node confirmed malignancy in the right breast with metastasis to the axillary lymph node. Histopathological examination (HPE) of the TRUCUT biopsy from the right breast lump revealed ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast with focal areas of squamous differentiation. Subsequently, due to the confirmed malignancy on histopathology, the patient underwent a total mastectomy and was sent for further HPE. We received the excised specimen of the right breast following the toilet mastectomy. On gross examination, the tumor measured 6.5 cm &#215; 6 cm &#215; 4.5 cm, and on cut sections, the tumor was gray-white with solid areas [<xref rid="jmh.jmh_88_25-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref rid="jmh.jmh_88_25-f001" ref-type="fig">b</xref>].

All the margins were free of tumor. The skin overlying the breast was also normal histologically.

</p><p>The exact cause and development of SCC in the breast remain uncertain. Some suggest it could represent an extreme form of squamous cell metaplasia progressing into adenocarcinoma, potentially explaining its mixed forms.[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Squamous cell metaplasia is commonly observed in cysts, chronic inflammations, abscesses, and adenofibromas, but in this particular case, no such preexisting abnormalities were noted. SCC of the breast typically presents with inflammation and tends to grow larger than adenocarcinomas. It predominantly affects elderly individuals, often resulting in large tumors up to 5 cm in size.</p><p>Mammograms usually do not reveal distinctive features, while ultrasound may show a complex cyst or signs of inflammation. HPE of SCC typically reveals large malignant squamoid cells arranged in sheets with intercellular bridges and keratin formation. Unlike adenocarcinomas, SCCs are reported to have less lymphatic spread initially, but lymph node involvement may still occur in 10%&#8211;30% of cases at the time of surgery.[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Approximately 30% of patients may develop distant metastases. Treatment strategies for SCC of the breast generally mirror those for other common types of breast cancer, including surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiation. However, due to its rarity, the optimal therapeutic approach remains to be determined. According to recent research, over 70% of individuals with breast SCC do not initially exhibit involvement of the axillary lymph nodes.</p><p>Nevertheless, axillary lymph node dissection is frequently performed for staging due to the unpredictability of lymph node spread.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Typically, chemotherapeutic drugs, including methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and anthracyclines, which are frequently used for ductal carcinoma, do not work well against SCC.[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In a few situations, 5-FU and cisplatin have demonstrated potential in treating metastatic illness; nevertheless, more research is required.</p><p>SCC of the breast is usually hormone receptor-negative and high-grade, making hormone-based therapies ineffective. HER2/neu expression is typically amplified in this disease, but there is often a high frequency of EGFR positivity, suggesting potential avenues for future treatment development. The prognosis of SCC remains somewhat controversial, with many studies indicating it behaves aggressively, similar to poorly differentiated breast carcinoma. A small retrospective series reported a 5-year survival rate of 67% among eleven patients.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>In summary, breast SCC is an exceptionally aggressive cancer, frequently resulting in both local and distant recurrences, which often lead to death. There is a pressing need for improved systemic therapies to enhance patient outcomes. Determining EGFR&#8217;s potential as a therapeutic target requires examining its function in this form of cancer and its associated signaling pathways. Clinical trials combining anti-EGFR therapies with synergistic cytotoxic drugs such as taxanes and platinum should be considered. Furthermore, it is imperative to conduct biological studies on these uncommon breast tumors to comprehend the reasons behind chemotherapy resistance and to find additional treatment targets.</p><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.
