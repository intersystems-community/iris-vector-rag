In Zambia, trachoma is endemic and Western Province is one of the most affected provinces. The SAFE (surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement) strategy is recommended for elimination of trachoma. In many settings, interventions particularly for facial cleanliness and environmental improvement are sub-optimally adopted due to lack of prioritization and inadequate funding of intervention activities. This study sought to establish the level of, and factors associated with adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion in the SAFE strategy among health workers in Western Province, Zambia.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methodology/principal findings</title><p>This was a cross-sectional study involving 24 health facilities selected from three districts using stratified random sampling. A total of 388 health workers comprising environmental health officers, community health assistants and community health workers were randomly selected. Adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion was self-reported, defined as participation in community distribution of information, education and communication (IEC) materials or community demonstrations of correct hand and face washing methods or both, within the past six months. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with adoption using STATA Version 15.

WHO recommends the surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness and environmental improvements (SAFE strategy) for elimination of trachoma in endemic communities. Studies have shown that facial and environmental hygiene promotion has not been adequately adopted in many places and the associated factors are unclear. We determined the level of, and factors associated with adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion among health workers in three districts in Western Province, Zambia. We found that adoption of the intervention was generally low (47.68%) and was highest in Kalabo District compared to the other districts. The most widely adopted core component of the intervention was community demonstrations of correct hand and face washing methods. Participants who had available transport, perceived the intervention as relevant for trachoma prevention, had received training in F and E components of the SAFE strategy and those who had IEC materials were more likely to adopt the intervention. To enhance health worker adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion, trachoma elimination program officers and stakeholders should ensure that they consider these factors during the planning and implementation of the SAFE strategy.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>University of Zambia</institution></funding-source><award-id>TDR scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7496-031X</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Kasongo</surname><given-names>Martha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>MK. received support as a recipient of a TDR scholarship under the Postgraduate Training Scheme in Implementation Research at the University of Zambia.

The disease is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people and causes about 1.4% of all blindness worldwide [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Approximately, 103 million people in the world live in trachoma endemic areas and are at risk of trachoma blindness [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In Africa, trachoma is endemic. The prevalence of Trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF), an eye disease caused by repeated infection with <italic toggle="yes">Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, is greater than 5% in children aged 1&#8211;9 years old in 44 countries. Of these, 26 countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for 85% of the global trachoma burden [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the SAFE (surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement) strategy for the elimination of trachoma [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this strategy, surgery is used to stop trichiasis cases from leading to blindness, antibiotics are used to treat active infections and prevent further transmission and facial cleanliness and environmental improvements are used to prevent transmission of the parasite by flies [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Evidence shows that improvements in facial cleanliness and environmental hygiene have significantly contributed to reduction in the prevalence of trachoma in endemic communities [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite the importance of facial cleanliness and environmental improvements, there is evidence that demonstrates that these interventions are inadequately implemented in some endemic settings and this could explain the slow progress towards elimination of trachoma in certain endemic countries [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For example, a study in Ethiopia found that there was inadequate implementation of facial and environmental hygiene promotion activities as only 56% and 68% of SAFE implementing districts implemented and reported on &#8220;F&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8221; components respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, the adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion is reported to be affected by health workers&#8217; attitudes and limited knowledge on the importance of facial cleanliness and environmental hygiene for trachoma elimination [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In Zambia, trachoma is a major public health problem. According to the Ministry of Health (MoH), the prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular is more than 5% in 1&#8211;9 year olds in 16 of the districts and nearly 1.5 million people are at risk of infection [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although a recent survey has shown a reduction in the prevalence, trachoma remains a public health problem in Zambia [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In 2013, Zambia through the MoH and supporting non-governmental organizations such as Lions Aid Norway started implementing the full SAFE strategy for trachoma elimination in endemic districts. To facilitate the implementation process, the MoH developed the Zambia SAFE Strategy Implementation Framework which provided guidelines on intervention activities. Facial and environmental hygiene promotion was done by health workers in collaboration with community health workers to facilitate community-wide adoption of facial cleanliness and environmental hygiene practices [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The core components of facial and environmental hygiene promotion comprised community sensitization using information, education and communication (IEC) material and demonstrations of correct hand and face washing methods [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other activities included stakeholder consultation meetings, promotion of these interventions in schools and engagement of community leaders to champion change in their communities [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Like other low-income countries, little is known about the factors associated with adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion in Zambia as no study has investigated the F and E components of the SAFE strategy in the country. Similar studies conducted in other countries have assessed implementation of the SAFE strategy interventions, but it is unclear if their findings are generalizable to Zambia [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Understanding the factors associated with adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion can guide trachoma elimination programs in developing strategies to strengthen adoption and implementation of these interventions, thereby accelerating trachoma elimination [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This study therefore sought to establish the level of, and factors associated with adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion among health workers in Western Province, Zambia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study did not involve child participants.

Although the RE-AIM framework has been used in previous trachoma studies, many have largely concentrated on assessing reach and effectiveness of trachoma interventions [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. No studies have attempted to assess and identify the contextual factors shaping adoption of trachoma control interventions among health providers. A systematic review of interventions used the RE-AIM framework to identify effective and ineffective strategies for addressing barriers to the uptake of eye care services in developing countries [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Another study in Niger used the RE-AIM framework to assess reach of azithromycin distribution for child survival by comparing door to door and fixed delivery strategies [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a cross-sectional study. This design was ideal for determining the proportion of health workers who had adopted facial and environmental hygiene promotion while allowing the identification of the factors associated with adoption of the intervention [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Study setting</title><p>This study was conducted in Shangombo, Kalabo and Kaoma districts in Western Province of Zambia in the months of March and April 2023. At the time of the study, Western Province had the highest prevalence of trachoma with some districts having as high as 17% prevalence of TF in children aged 1&#8211;9 years old [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Seven districts were implementing the full SAFE strategy in Western Province at the time of the study. Of these, only three districts met the inclusion criteria of having commenced implementation of the SAFE strategy in 2013 and having a trachoma prevalence (TF prevalence in children aged 1&#8211;9 years old) greater than 10% as of 2018 [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. At the time of the study, Western Province had approximately 307 health facilities that were offering primary health care services. Of these, approximately 52 were distributed in the three study districts. Data was collected in primary health care facilities including urban health centers, rural health centers and health posts.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Sampling and participant recruitment</title><p>The study population included environmental health technologists, community health assistants and community health workers. In the three districts, the total population was estimated at 564 health workers (512 community health workers and 52 environmental health technologists and community health assistants). The sample size was calculated using Cochran&#8217;s equation, n &#8805; (Z<sup>2</sup> p [1-p])/e<sup>2</sup> where, n is the minimum estimated sample size, z is the selected critical value of the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95% confidence level); p is the estimated proportion of an attribute that is present in the population (assumed to be 0.50 given the lack of a previous study from which to estimate the population proportion); and e is the desired level of precision settled at 5%. Using the given formula, a sample size of 384 workers was calculated. However, a sample size of 390 was used to allow a 2% non-response rate. Using probabilities proportional to size of the number of health workers in each district, the random sample sizes for each district were calculated as 166, 60 and 164 for Kaoma, Shangombo and Kalabo, respectively.</p><p>A total of 24 health facilities were randomly selected from a pool of 52 using probability proportional to size (PPS). Within each district, facilities were stratified by type including urban health centers, rural health centers, and health posts, and listed accordingly. A PPS-based random sample was then drawn from each stratum. Similarly, the number of health workers sampled from each facility was estimated using PPS based on the total number of health workers at each facility. Finally, systematic sampling was used to select participants at the health facility using a sampling frame provided by the facility in-charge. This was done by selecting every n<sup>th</sup> person, calculated by dividing the total number of health workers listed on the sampling frame by the required sample size at a particular health facility. In a case where a participant did not give consent or was unreachable, the next name on the list was selected. Health workers were eligible to participate in the study if they were involved in community health promotion activities and had worked in their position for not less than one year.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data was collected using a structured questionnaire using an online tool, Kobo Collect. The questionnaire was prepared in English and verbally translated to the local language, Lozi, during the data collection. The principal investigator collected the data with the help of 3 research assistants who were natives of the three districts included in the study. These research assistants received training on the study and data collection tool a week prior to the commencement of data collection. The questionnaire was piloted in separate health facilities. The data was collected over a period of one month.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Measurement of variables</title><p>As discussed earlier, the dependent variable was adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion for trachoma elimination. Adoption was measured on a binary scale. Health workers were considered to have adopted facial and environmental hygiene promotion if they had conducted or taken part in community distribution of IEC materials or community demonstrations of correct hand and face washing methods or both in the past six months. All the independent variables or contextual factors influencing adoption were measured on the nominal scale, except for age which was a continuous variable. The independent variables included socio-demographic factors (age, sex and district), facility type, training, availability of IEC material, availability of transport, perceived intervention complexity, perceived intervention relevance and attitude towards facial and environmental hygiene promotion.</p><p>Training was a dichotomous variable coded as yes if a participant had received training on F and E components of the SAFE strategy. IEC material availability was dichotomized, denoting presence or absence of IEC materials containing information on the &#8216;F&#8217; and &#8216;E&#8217; components of the SAFE strategy. This could be any type of IEC material that an individual health center might have made or obtained from other trachoma stakeholders or through any other means. Transport was classified as a categorical variable, categorized as readily available if it was accessible at least once per week, rarely available if accessible at least once per month but not weekly, and not available if it was either entirely absent or unavailable for a month or more. Perceived complexity of the intervention was measured as a dichotomous variable, based on whether respondents found facial and environmental hygiene promotion activities complicated and difficult to carry out. Similarly, perceived relevance was a dichotomous variable, determined by whether respondents believed that facial and environmental hygiene promotion was important for preventing trachoma transmission.</p><p>Lastly, attitude towards facial and environmental hygiene promotion was assessed by asking participants how they felt about the statement: &#8220;There is no need for me to conduct facial and environmental hygiene promotion activities in a community where mass drug administration (MDA) has recently been conducted.&#8221; Response options included: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree, which were considered as reflecting attitudes ranging from very negative to very positive.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Data analysis</title><p>During data analysis, the distribution of the continuous variable was checked for normality using a histogram with a super imposed normal curve. The continuous variable, age, was not normally distributed and therefore, we reported the median and inter-quartile range. To test associations between categorical variables, Pearson&#8217;s chi square test was used upon satisfying the assumptions. Otherwise, Fisher&#8217;s exact test was used. The non-parametric, Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to check for the association between the outcome variable and the continuous variable, age.</p><p>An investigator led backward stepwise multivariable logistic regression was used. Both binary and multivariable logistic regression were performed to identify factors associated with adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion. Firstly, binary logistic regression was performed on all independent variables against the outcome variable. In the second step, we run a multivariable logistic regression containing all the variables that were significant at binary logistic regression analysis. After this, the variables with the highest p-values were individually removed from the model, retaining only significant variables that best explain the data (best fit model). However, given the stratified random sampling design used in this study, we incorporated both the strata and cluster variables regardless of whether they were significant or not, into the model, to avoid underestimating the confidence intervals. Selection of the best model was performed using the likelihood ratio test. We reported robust estimates of odds ratios and confidence intervals at both binary and multivariable logistic regression to counter any possible clustering effects. Variables were declared statistically significant at p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05. Data was analyzed using STATA software version 15.0 SE (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec014"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Characteristics of the participants</title><p>A total of 388 health workers completed the questionnaire.

Availability of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials was also associated with higher adoption (AOR&#8201;=&#8201;3.04, 95% CI = [1.69, 5.46]). On the other hand, this study found that there was no significant association between adoption of the intervention and sex, type of facility and supervisor&#8217;s position.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pntd.0013483.t002" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0013483.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Factors associated with adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion (Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression results).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="pntd.0013483.t002g" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pntd.0013483.t002.jpg"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Explanatory Variable</th><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Unadjusted Estimates</th><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Adjusted Estimates</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OR</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(95%CI)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P-value</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AOR</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(95%CI)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="7" rowspan="1">

The study found that slightly less than half of the participants (47.68%) adopted the intervention and of the three districts included in the study, Kalabo had the highest proportion of participants who had adopted the intervention and Shangombo had the lowest proportion. The factors associated with adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion included district of respondent, transport availability, perceived complexity of the intervention, perceived relevance of the intervention, training, availability of IEC materials and attitude towards facial and environmental hygiene promotion activities in communities that have recently undergone MDA.</p><p>The low level of adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion among health workers may be inadequate to significantly advance population level goals of reducing trachoma prevalence, potentially contributing to the slow progress towards elimination in Western Province. This concern is supported by previous studies showing that alongside administration of antibiotics, regions with enhanced adoption and implementation of facial and environmental hygiene promotion achieve faster control of trachoma [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast to our finding, Ghana, one of the first countries to eliminate trachoma, implemented all components of the SAFE strategy, including F and E promotion, with equal and high level intensity [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our findings are consistent with previous literature that also reported low adoption of the F and E components [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], underscoring a persistent gap that may be hindering effective trachoma control.</p><p>Both the core components of the intervention were only moderately adopted, except in Shangombo District, where adoption of community distribution of IEC material was higher. These findings suggest that facial and environmental hygiene promotion may not be implemented in accordance with the WHO recommendations. WHO and other trachoma stakeholders encourage countries implementing the SAFE strategy to scale up behavioral change strategies for health promotion such as community demonstrations of correct hand and face washing techniques [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similarly, the review of grey literature on facial cleanliness and environmental improvement interventions for trachoma control found that very few interventions targeted behavior change activities [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This may be due to a lack of research on proximal precedents of behavior such as attitudes and norms which hinders the design of behavioral change strategies. The systematic review [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which included studies from diverse settings, strengthens the likelihood that our findings reflect broader trends across other SAFE-implementing contexts.</p><p>Health workers from Kaoma and Shangombo districts were less likely to adopt facial and environmental hygiene promotion compared to those from Kalabo. This observation could have been influenced by attitudes towards facial and environmental hygiene promotion. Most of the participants with positive attitude towards the need to conduct facial and environmental hygiene promotion in communities which have recently undergone mass drug administration of antibiotics were from Kalabo compared to the other two districts. This is supported by previous studies which reported that attitude was an important factor in the adoption and implementation of health education and promotion activities [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Transport availability for use in health promotion activities affected adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion. Majority of the health workers reported not having transport for use in community health promotion activities, and they were less likely to adopt the intervention compared to those who indicated that transport was rarely or readily available. This finding is not surprising as lack of funding and resources such as transport make it difficult for health workers to carry out health promotion activities [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Further, our findings align with those of a previous study which found that organizations implementing facial cleanliness and environmental improvement interventions often received less funding and support, for resources such as transport, compared to those focusing on surgery and antibiotics components [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The perceived complexity and relevance of facial and environmental hygiene promotion affected adoption of this intervention. Health workers who found the intervention hard to implement were less likely to adopt it compared to those who felt it was uncomplicated and easy to execute. Similarly, health workers who perceived the intervention as being relevant for trachoma prevention were more likely to adopt it compared to those who perceived it otherwise. This may be because individuals who perceive an activity as complicated or unimportant are less likely to be motivated to engage in it. These finding are consistent with a previous study in Australia, which found that school respondents had limited knowledge on trachoma, its prevalence and the role of facial cleanliness and environmental improvements in trachoma prevention, resulting in reduced confidence in teaching about hygiene and trachoma prevention practices [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Similarly, a study found that believing that IEC material were relevant in the delivery of health education and promotion activities was associated with higher odds of material utilization [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>IEC materials are a critical component of health promotion activities as they make it easy to deliver health education information to the community and may motivate staff to participate in health promotion activities. Our study found that participants who had IEC materials for facial and environmental hygiene promotion available were more likely to adopt the intervention compared to those who did not. This finding could be because IEC materials inform health workers and provide a guidance on key messages to include in sensitization talks, making it easy for them to conduct health promotion activities. This, in turn, increases their motivation to engage in such activities. This finding is consistent with findings from previous research which showed that availability of IEC materials affected workers&#8217; delivery of health education and promotion activities [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Training of health workers is important to enhance the delivery of facial and environmental hygiene promotion activities [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our study found that health workers who had received training in facial cleanliness and environmental improvements components were more likely to adopt the intervention compared to those who had not. This could be because those who have been trained are more likely to be knowledgeable and confident to carry out the intervention activities. This finding is consistent with another study that found that lack of training was one of the factors which was perceived to influence the implementation of health education and promotion activities by health workers [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>We found that Shangombo District had not widely adopted community demonstrations of correct hand and face washing methods. Similarly, a study assessing trachoma elimination progress in districts with persistent trachoma in Western Province, Zambia, reported that the prevalence of TF in children aged 1&#8211;9 years only declined from 17.9% to 12.5% between 2018 and 2023 in Shangombo [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This indicates that trachoma remains a public health problem in the district, meeting the WHO criteria for persistent trachoma [<xref rid="pntd.0013483.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These findings suggest that failure to implement behavior change interventions, such as community demonstrations of proper hand and face washing methods, may contribute to continued transmission of active trachoma.</p><p>The study findings can support program implementers in lobbying for dedicated funding for facial and environmental hygiene promotion from government and donor agencies, given their commitment to implementing the full SAFE strategy in the study area. Such funds could be used to ensure the availability of key resources including IEC materials, transport and to facilitate training for health workers on the importance of facial and environmental hygiene promotion in trachoma elimination.</p><p>This study had two limitations. Firstly, using a stratified random sampling design potentially introduced clustering of the data at the different levels of the cluster and strata variables, signifying that our findings may not be generalizable outside the three districts of Zambia. To mitigate this, we report robust estimates of odds ratios and confidence intervals to counter clustering effects. Further, we incorporated the strata and cluster variables into the model to avoid underestimating the confidence intervals. Secondly, the use of a questionnaire to gather self-reported information on adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion is subject to recall bias. Participants could possibly recall wrongly that they had taken part in intervention activities when in fact they had not.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, health worker adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion was low. Key factors influencing adoption included the availability of transport and IEC materials, attitudes towards facial and environmental hygiene promotion, and perceptions of the intervention&#8217;s relevance and complexity. Health workers with easy access to transport and IEC materials were more likely to adopt the intervention, highlighting the need for consistent resource availability. This can be addressed through increased funding and budget allocation for facial and environmental hygiene promotion activities, especially given the Government of Zambia&#8217;s commitment to implementing all components of the SAFE strategy. Additionally, health workers who had received training in F and E promotion were more likely to adopt the intervention than those who had not, underscoring the importance of targeted capacity building. Training should emphasize the relevance of facial and environmental hygiene promotion in trachoma prevention, provide clear guidance on how to implement the intervention, and address perceptions of complexity. Importantly, training should also reinforce the need to continue facial and environmental hygiene promotion even in communities where mass drug administration of antibiotics for trachoma has already been conducted. These insights should inform strategies to improve adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion, ultimately supporting population-level behavior change and advancing progress towards trachoma elimination.</p></sec><sec id="sec020" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pntd.0013483.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>The data set used for analysis.</title><p>This Excel file contains anonymized raw data collected from the questionnaires, which was used for all statistical analyses in the manuscript.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pntd.0013483.s001.xls" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Martha Kasongo is a recipient of a TDR scholarship under the Postgraduate Training Scheme in Implementation Research at the University of Zambia.

</p><p>
<bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold>
</p><p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the following:</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold>
</p><p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p><p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p><p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p><p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p><p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p><p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;In Background (page 2), the authors didn't explain about the reason of the "interventions particularly for facial cleanliness and environmental improvement have been sub-optimally adopted"</p><p>In Introduction (page 6), the authors have to explain, in depth, the usefulness of the results. The authors only mentioned: "The results will inform......through the identified determinants of adoption"</p><p>In Methods (page 6), the study employed the RE-AIM/PRISM but it's not clear if there some evidence of the use of RE-AIM/PRISM in trachoma's studies</p><p>The authors also mentioned the following: "it is one of the understudied areas in this field". I recommend to explain the idea in introduction</p><p>In sampling and participant recruitment (page 8) stratified random sampling method was used so it's necessary to estimate the sample size calculation with design effect</p><p>I suggest to explain a little more some variables like training, position held, length of service, etc before the results. e.g.1. perceived intervention complexity, how it complexity define?</p><p>e.g.2. transport availability, and the options are not available, rarely available and readily available. what does mean rarely? once, twice a month?</p><p>In data collection (page 9), the authors mentioned that the quantitative data was collected by the principal investigator with help of 3 research assistants. I suggest to introduce more information about the research assistants, e.g. they trained before the study's execution</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;The main issue is that the sampling strategy was confusing. Is this a random sample?</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;The objectives of the study are clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated</p><p>The study design is appropriate to address the study objectives</p><p>The targeted and sampled population is clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested</p><p>The sample size is sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested</p><p>The study applied the correct statistical analysis to support conclusions</p><p>The study has no concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements. All ethical or regulatory requirements were met</p><p>**********</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold>
</p><p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p><p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p><p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;I don't understand why the authors show the characteristics of the participants in two tables. Is there some reason?</p><p>I recommend to write the main results (page 10). e.g. 34.79% were from health posts. I will change this instead 51.55 were from rural health centre</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Yes</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;The analysis which was conducted matches the analysis plan</p><p>The study results are clearly and fully presented</p><p>The figures (Tables, Images) included in the study are sufficient quality for clarity</p><p>**********</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions:</bold>
</p><p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p><p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p><p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p><p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;The discussion is too long and it's not clear about the information that the authors want to give to the readers.</p><p>e.g. Our findings are similar to those of Tsang et al (2021) perhaps due to the fact that both research were conducted in rural areas and the study populations were very similar (page 22).</p><p>The majority of the studies about trachoma were developed in rural setting so the information gave for the authors is not relevant</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Generally yes though in the limitations paragraph I would comment that these results may not be generalizable outside these districts of Zambia, and I would limit any conclusions only to the study area and not try to extrapolate to other settings.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;The conclusions are supported by the data presented, though the conclusion should be strengthened and rephrased to focus on key information from the results presented</p><p>The limitations of analysis should be clearly described</p><p>The authors have discussed how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study</p><p>Public health relevance has been addressed</p><p>**********</p><p>
<bold>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</bold>
</p><p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend &#8220;Minor Revision&#8221; or &#8220;Accept&#8221;.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;I suggest only use the variables that are really important to the study. I think there are so many variables that it could create a confusion to the reader</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;(No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;The authors should make minor revisions</p><p>**********</p><p>
<bold>Summary and General Comments:</bold>
</p><p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;I will review the regression analysis carefully, as the authors used stratified random sampling. This sampling design requires adjustments in the regression model to avoid underestimating the confidence intervals. Maybe, Incorporate strata and cluster variables into the model.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Line 33: what intervention? It&#8217;s not clear what these percentages refer to</p><p>Line 34: not sure the lower odds in Kaoma and Shangombo need to be in the abstract. That seems like knowledge that would be important for local policymakers but this paper is presumably being written to share more broadly generalizable knowledge. I would delete that sentence. (And probably the final sentence of the conclusion)</p><p>Line 40: similar comment, but need to specify what adoption is, and how it is defined. Is this self-reported adoption? What components were adopted?</p><p>Line 80: &#8220;core components&#8221;: is this promoted by the government in some official way? Is this a more informal assessment by the authors based on activities of NGOs? Please more clearly state how these core components have been defined.</p><p>Line 81: Are IEC materials a standardized set of materials made by the government? Or by an NGO? Or does this just mean any type of materials that an individual health center might have made.</p><p>Line 136: &#8220;full SAFE strategy&#8221;: who makes this decision / who implements this. Is this from the government/MOH? Is this NGOs?</p><p>Line 156: the methods for stratified random sampling were not clear. In line 160, does &#8220;representative&#8221; = &#8220;random&#8221; (and if so, please use the word random). I wondered if 24 health facilities were randomly selected from the total pool of 52 health facilities using probability proportional to size sampling, and then if within these 24 selected facilities systematic sampling was employed. (but no details are given about how the systematic sampling was actually done, and my summary above is not actually stated anywhere but just my hypothesis of what was done.) Please be more explicit about the sampling.</p><p>Line 222: how was &#8220;knowledgeable about facial and environmental hygiene promotion&#8221; defined? Is this knowledge? Or familiarity?</p><p>Line 225: how was a &#8220;positive attitude&#8221; defined, or how was the question asked? (If as stated in Table 1b, I would include this in the text as well)</p><p>Table 1b: &#8220;perceived relevance of F and E&#8221;: relevance for what? Relevant for trachoma control? Relevant as an activity that the health center should be doing?</p><p>Table 1b: what does &#8220;incentives&#8221; mean. That the workers are paid extra to do hygiene promotion above and beyond their salary?</p><p>Table 1c: spell out full words of IEC in footnote or caption</p><p>Table 2: I believe the AOR was constructed from all variables in the table after applying a backwards stepwise approach. (A) what was the p-value threshold to remove a variable from the model? (maybe include this in the methods) (B) in the table caption or footnote I would include that the adjusted model was selected using a backwards stepwise approach. (C) in the table caption please specify what the outcome is for the ORs (adoption of promotion activities I believe?).</p><p>Line 288: &#8220;determinants&#8221; makes this sound like a causal relationship. But here only an association has been found. I would change to &#8220;The main factors associated with&#8230;&#8221; or something like that. Also: I did not scour the text after noticing this, but please read through and make sure that the text uses words that expresses only a cross-sectional association, and not a causal relationship.</p><p>Line 391: trachoma prevalence was not reported here. A citation should be given, and also a little more detail. (What does a &#8220;decrease in trachoma prevalence&#8221; mean? Between which years? According to which surveys? Does this mean TF?)</p><p>Line 299: &#8220;there is a need to increase funding&#8221;: I am not sure I agree. If I were a donor I would want evidence that implementing F&amp;E is effective. Currently there are very few interventional studies that have shown F&amp;E to be effective. Almost all the evidence comes from observational studies. If health workers are not adopting hygiene promotion but hygiene promotion does not work, then why should funders devote more money to it? Also, the results of this one study may not be relevant to other places. You could consider some caveats to this sentence, eg: &#8220;The results of this study demonstrate a need for increased funding and training in facial and environmental hygiene promotion in the study area, given the district/zone/federal stated plans/commitment/goals for hygiene programming.&#8221; Or something like that, which would be accurate for the Zambian setting.</p><p>Fig 1: these are petty comments, and if it is very difficult to change I would not worry about it, but for your next paper consider: (a) no need for any decimal places on y axis; (b) third dimension on bar graphs conveying no information and thus should be dropped.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;Under key words &#8211; consider rephrasing to Determinants; Adoption; Facial and environmental hygiene promotion; SAFE strategy; Trachoma elimination; Western Province, Zambia as key words</p><p>Line 22 &#8211; consider including this statement; In Zambia, Western province is the most affected province with trachoma.

</p><p>Dear Ms. Kasongo,</p><p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript 'Factors associated with&#160;health worker adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion in the &#8216;SAFE strategy&#8217; for trachoma elimination&#160; in Western Province, Zambia.' has been provisionally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p><p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests.</p><p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p><p>IMPORTANT: The editorial review process is now complete. PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling, formatting or significant scientific errors from this point onwards. Requests for major changes, or any which affect the scientific understanding of your work, will cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript.</p><p>Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us now if you or your institution is planning to press release the article. All press must be co-ordinated with PLOS.</p><p>Thank you again for supporting Open Access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Josh M Colston, Ph.D.</p><p>Academic Editor</p><p>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</p><p>Amy Morrison</p><p>Section Editor</p><p>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</p><p>Shaden Kamhawi</p><p>co-Editor-in-Chief</p><p>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</p><p>orcid.org/0000-0003-4304-636XX</p><p>Paul Brindley</p><p>co-Editor-in-Chief</p><p>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</p><p>orcid.org/0000-0003-1765-0002</p><p>***********************************************************</p><p>Thank you for your resubmission, and congratulations on an excellent study and article that is well worthy of publication in PLOS NTDs.</p><p>p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 16.0px; font: 14.0px Arial; color: #323333; -webkit-text-stroke: #323333}span.s1 {font-kerning: none</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pntd.0013483.r004" specific-use="acceptance-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0013483.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Acceptance letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names initials="AC">Amy C.</given-names></name><role>Section Editor</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Colston</surname><given-names initials="JM">Josh M.</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Morrison, Colston</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Morrison, Colston</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pntd.0013483" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/></front-stub><body><p>Dear Kasongo,</p><p>We are delighted to inform you that your manuscript, "&#160;</p><p>Factors associated with health worker adoption of facial and environmental hygiene promotion in the &#8216;SAFE strategy&#8217; for trachoma elimination in Western Province, Zambia.," has been formally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p><p>We have now passed your article onto the PLOS Production Department who will complete the rest of the publication process. All authors will receive a confirmation email upon publication.</p><p>The corresponding author will soon be receiving a typeset proof for review, to ensure errors have not been introduced during production. Please review the PDF proof of your manuscript carefully, as this is the last chance to correct any scientific or type-setting errors. Please note that major changes, or those which affect the scientific understanding of the work, will likely cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript. Note: Proofs for Front Matter articles (Editorial, Viewpoint, Symposium, Review, etc...) are generated on a different schedule and may not be made available as quickly.</p><p>Soon after your final files are uploaded, the early version of your manuscript will be published online unless you opted out of this process. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p><p>You will receive an invoice from PLOS for your publication fee after your manuscript has reached the completed accept phase. If you receive an email requesting payment before acceptance or for any other service, this may be a phishing scheme.
