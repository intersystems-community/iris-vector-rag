Using design tools we investigated <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> LipA, a lipase with a flexible lid domain crucial for substrate binding and turnover, aiming to enhance its hydrolysis of the industrially relevant substrate Roche ester. We generated an initial set of single-point mutations based on structural proximity to the active site and evaluated their effects using a computational pipeline integrating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and ensemble-based energy scoring. While we identified several active variants, attempts to rank them by activity using structural features, such as hydrogen bond formation or residue flexibility, failed. Deep learning models, applied <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> for structural analysis via AlphaFold3, produced nearly identical active site geometries across variants, irrespective of activity. Reaction pathway analysis revealed energy barriers varying by 5&#8211;15 kcal/mol depending on substrate conformation, with the nucleophile addition step consistently rate-limiting. However, these small energetic shifts, likely critical for incremental activity changes, were indistinguishable by current computational or deep learning methods. Our results highlight the limitations of existing approaches in resolving subtle functional differences and underscore the need for improved benchmarks, reactive force fields, and more sensitive ranking metrics. Advancing these areas will be essential for designing enzymes with gradual, evolution-like activity improvements and for bridging the gap between structural prediction and catalytic function.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000009</institution-id><institution>Foundation for the National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15GM155803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8884-9724</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Della Corte</surname><given-names>Dennis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JA 448/8-1</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>D.DC and S.G. were supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under award number R15GM155803.

These characteristics make enzymes attractive for sustainable manufacturing and green chemistry applications [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, enzymes are rarely suitable for direct use in industrial processes without modification, as evolution has optimized them for cellular contexts rather than non-natural environments [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Consequently, enzymes often require extensive optimization to function effectively under non-physiological conditions or to catalyze novel chemical transformations [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This inherent limitation has driven interest in enzyme engineering, with the goal of designing bespoke biocatalysts for specific applications [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite progress in enzyme engineering, generating highly efficient catalysts remains a formidable challenge [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Directed evolution has been a cornerstone of enzyme optimization, yet it comes with significant limitations: it is resource-intensive, time-consuming, and often constrained by the availability of starting points for desired reactions [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While ultrahigh-throughput screening and continuous evolution platforms have expanded the potential of directed evolution, these methods still struggle to address the vast diversity of chemical transformations [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Enzyme promiscuity offers some solutions, providing a foundation for evolving new functions, but a generalizable strategy for designing efficient enzymes from scratch remains elusive [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p><italic toggle="yes">De novo</italic> enzyme design has emerged as a promising strategy, leveraging computational tools to construct novel catalysts from first principles [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This approach can incorporate both natural and unnatural amino acids, as well as metal cofactors, to achieve desired reactivity. Computational methods often involve designing theozymes and selecting or hallucinating protein scaffolds, followed by packing optimization to refine active site geometry [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While this dramatically expands the design space, achieving efficient enzymatic catalysis requires an extraordinary degree of precision, as even minor deviations in side-chain positioning can drastically impair function [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The active site must stabilize the transition state while discriminating against the ground state, a delicate balance that often hinges on angstrom-level accuracy.

However, despite identifying functional mutants, we found no reliable way to reproducibly rank them using either our physics-based pipeline or state-of-the-art deep learning models. The observed activity differences&#8212;up to a tenfold increase&#8212;correspond to less than a 2 kcal/mol reduction in transition state energy, which is at the accuracy limit of DFT calculations. This suggests that the sensitivity of current computational methods may be insufficient to resolve the subtle energetic distinctions that govern enzymatic efficiency.</p><p>DFT simulations of the active site model revealed comparable energy barriers for transition states 1 and 3, indicating that both steps are rate-limiting. This finding underscores the importance of stabilizing multiple transition states in the design of multi-step enzymes such as serine hydrolases [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>While deep learning has generated significant excitement in protein engineering, our results underscore critical limitations in applying these tools across different design targets. AlphaFold3 modeling of the enzyme-Roche ester complex produced nearly identical structures for all variants, with an &#945;-carbon RMSD of &lt;0.6 &#197; and an active site backbone RMSD of &lt;0.18 &#197;. These minuscule structural differences do not allow distinguishing active and inactive enzyme states from static structure predictions alone. This aligns with recent findings that deep learning models primarily capture the most probable conformation, overlooking protein dynamic effects and transition states that are known to be essential for catalysis [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>The inability of existing methods to resolve small activity differences suggests that current tools are better suited for identifying large structural shifts rather than refining single-point mutations. This limitation is particularly problematic in directed evolution, where activity improvements often occur through incremental optimizations [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Computational approaches like RFDiffusion or BayesDesign, which explore more extensive sequence and structural space, may be necessary to generate variants with sufficiently large activity shifts for reliable computational discrimination.</p><p>Our findings further highlight the urgent need for improved benchmarking of enzyme design pipelines. Existing structure-based approaches, including PLACER, failed to identify distinguishing features between active and inactive LipA variants, calling into question their applicability for subtle activity predictions [<xref rid="pone.0332409.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. While PLACER&#8217;s ability to generate reaction intermediate ensembles for predicting preorganization remains unverified, its successful implementation as a step between analyzing static structural models and the dynamic catalytic landscapes could be critical for fine tuning enzymatic activities.</p><p>Ultimately, overcoming these limitations will require a paradigm shift in computational enzyme design. The accuracy of DFT calculations is insufficient to accurately capture the small energy differences in such complex systems that dictate enzymatic function. Future progress will likely depend on the integration of high-accuracy quantum chemical methods, such as coupled-cluster-based force fields, with deep learning-driven MD simulations capable of modeling fully atomistic, solvated environments. Advances in reactive force fields that can accurately capture transition state geometries, coupled with AI-driven methods that account for enzyme dynamics, will be essential to move beyond the current barriers. By developing more precise computational tools, we can begin to resolve the fine energetic and structural differences that define enzymatic efficiency, ultimately enabling the rational design of highly efficient biocatalysts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Enzyme design protocol</title><p>We employed an ensemble-based computational design strategy to optimize the activation energy of the LipA-catalyzed reaction with the Roche ester substrate (see <xref rid="pone.0332409.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>).

For each mutation the residues in an ensemble were replaced and evaluated through energy minimization in ground state and tetrahedral conformation. Differences of calculated potential energies were normalized with respect to wild-type ensemble energy differences.

For variants that yielded &#8710;E values below 1.0 and met other filter criteria, an in vitro experiment was used to verify improved activity.

There are some of my inputs that can improve the quality of this article.</p><p>1) The title is very general. please be more specific</p><p>2) Please specify the selection of H14/M16/L17/H81!</p><p>3) Compare the RMSF (or RMSD relative to the crystal structure) in the CONCOORD ensemble vs. MD 100 ns. In this article, CONCOORD is mentioned to &#8220;lower the pressure&#8221; due to constraints. However, doesn't this make the ensemble too &#8220;too constrained&#8221;, thus losing millisecond-scale motions that can affect binding?</p><p>4) The author does not provide an explanation of the computational methods used, for example, AMBER99SB-ILDN and M06-2X/6-31G. Please clarify!</p><p>5) Please specify the solvent conditions in the DFT calculations!</p><p>6) In Figure 5, what specific criteria (distance &amp; angle) were used to detect H-bonds in the analysis? Were other thresholds (eg: 3.2 &#197;) tested to see if the pattern changed?</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

The authors have:</p><p>1) Addressed scientific transparency: They are now more open in explaining their methodological approach, assumptions, and limitations, so readers understand the context of the results presented.</p><p>2) Provided sufficient definition of controversies: Discrepancies between simulation and experimental results are no longer left "hanging," but rather the causes or possible underlying factors are explained.</p><p>3) Acknowledged study limitations: The discussion section now emphasizes the limitations of the computational method (for instance, DFT accuracy, parameterization sensitivity), so the conclusions do not seem too absolute.</p><p>4) Avoided overinterpretation: The results are now read more cautiously, emphasizing that the substrate recognition mechanism is influenced not only by cargo distribution at the terminal, but also by other, more complex factors.</p><p>With these revisions, it is clear that the authors accommodated reviewer's comments and improved the quality of the manuscript.
