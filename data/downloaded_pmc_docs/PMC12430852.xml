However, emergencies from disease, calamity, or conflict significantly disrupt the provision of immunization services through the primary healthcare system. This study aims to assess the impact of the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on routine immunization in selected public health facilities in Pathanamthitta district, Kerala, and understand aspects of planning and service delivery and the perspectives of primary stakeholders.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This mixed methods study of concurrent nested design in a Critical Realist paradigm assesses immunization patterns of 292 two-year-olds who sought routine immunization in 2020 and 2021. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics in SPSS v. 16, and thematic analysis was performed on qualitative data. Triangulation of results involved comparing both datasets to generate a discussion of themes corresponding to immunization coverage and outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Immunization coverage across vaccines dropped in March 2020, followed by intense catching-up efforts in the subsequent months. Median delays in immunization uptake in the sample during the state lockdown (42 days) were higher than those experienced during the national lockdown (25 days). COVID-induced anxiety in parents, physical infrastructure, and accessibility of the health centers determined children&#8217;s right to vaccines during the pandemic.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Decontextualized guidelines, continuation with existing microplans, infrastructural deficiencies, and poor vaccine perceptions of parents/guardians triggered delays in vaccine uptake and a far-from-perfect immunization service delivery. Programme planning and implementation issues should be mitigated to prepare for future health emergencies without disrupting immunization services.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>critical realism</kwd><kwd>India</kwd><kwd>Kerala</kwd><kwd>mixed methods</kwd><kwd>pandemic</kwd><kwd>routine immunization</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>Nil.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>The utility of immunization arises from the biomedical understanding that children under 5 years are highly vulnerable to life-threatening diseases.

Partially and unimmunized children under 5 years were prioritized at all centers. Significant changes in service delivery included the introduction of a slot-based appointment system, physical distancing, adoption of safety measures (masks, gloves, sanitisers, PPEs), permissible entry of only one caregiver per beneficiary in the immunization room, individual health education/counseling, and local COVID-19 assessments before organizing sessions.

Vaccine wastage was minimal as JPHNs opened vials based on the number of children to be vaccinated.</p></sec><sec><title>Staffing</title><p>During the pandemic, staffing was done prudently to avoid virus transmission and minimize fears of human interaction. At the health facilities, every immunization session was held with the near availability of an MO and managed by two JPHNs (one for vaccine administration and the other for record-keeping) and one Junior Health Inspector (JHI).

The delays in vaccine uptake were higher during the state lockdown in 2021 than the national lockdown in 2020, implying the response of anxious parents during the severe COVID-19 wave in 2021. Higher median delays in vaccine uptake in 2019 could mean a lapse on the part of the health system in following up with beneficiary households. Planning and service delivery of immunization suffered due to a greater emphasis on COVID-19 management at the grassroots level. Undertaking service delivery in the new circumstances with existing plans was a far-from-perfect approach. The health centers utilized their existing capacities to avoid technical glitches in vaccine logistics, staffing, and IEC activities. Parents/guardians, as non-passive actors, appreciated and expressed their grievances regarding the service delivery. Even as infrastructural deficiencies in health centers remained unaddressed, the new streamlined approach and vigilance of the health workers ought to be taken forward even when COVID-19 no longer persists as a threat.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>As Critical Realist research, this study discusses the underlying mechanisms behind the results obtained.

<bold>Vaccine Delays and Perceptions</bold>
</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>As India marches toward MR elimination goals and seeks to attain more than 95% coverage in two doses of MR vaccination,[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] delaying MR shots (and Vitamin A supplementation) will lead to a retreat in achievements. Personal observations and administrative data from the health centers indicate that children&#8217;s uptake of the remaining seven doses of Vitamin A largely depends on the convenience of parents/guardians. Communication and education strategies should be appropriately framed and implemented to change perceptions toward different vaccines (particularly MR) and assert their significance in child health. These vaccinations must be monitored with elimination targets for delays and avoidance.</p><sec><title>Strengths of the study</title><p>The study&#8217;s methodological paradigm and design enabled a multifaceted exploration of child immunization processes and perspectives in the selected health centers. Though this is research on a vulnerable group, &#8216;children&#8217;, their direct participation was not solicited. The in-person mode of data collection enabled the gathering of contextual information about the health centers and the corroboration of qualitative findings with quantitative and observational inputs. Research fatigue was not observed among the respondents because only few public health studies have been conducted in this district. The triangulation of evidence ensured internal validity via different tools from multiple sources. The utility criterion was fulfilled by evaluating almost all aspects of the program.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Unequal sample sizes would have revealed less of the study&#8217;s qualitative aspects than quantitative. Due to difficulties following up on a child through the immunization registers for 3 years, the data of only 292 children could be secured. Some parents/guardians&#8217; responses may have been influenced by the location of the interview and the presence of health workers in the vicinity. Despite multiple visits to the health centers, it was only possible to interview 30 parents/guardians. This was because fewer beneficiaries of the selected age group came to receive their Vitamin A supplementation at the time of data collection. Last, the generalizability of the findings of this study is limited as the results are specific to the context of the public health centers in this district.</p></sec><sec><title>Recommendations for future research</title><p>Future studies could replicate this research on a larger scale, including public and private health facilities, to provide a broader picture of child immunization in the district. Immunization outcomes and delays in coverage of children of higher age groups may be examined. Assessments on the effectiveness of IEC tools deployed, VPD surveillance mechanisms, and monitoring and evaluation frameworks of the health centers would provide more specific insights into the program.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Routine immunization is a critical service to child health that cannot be disregarded during a public health emergency. The study results convey disruptions to immunization services and delays experienced by 2-year-old children in their appropriate vaccine uptakes during the pandemic. Discrepancies in the preparation of guidelines, planning, service delivery, and community engagement precipitated less than complete coverage of most vaccines and significant outliers of delay. Fear of contracting COVID-19 and physical infrastructural deficiencies of the health centers influenced parental decisions. Therefore, it is recommended that the issues in program planning and implementation be rectified and the lessons learned be carried forward to prepare for future health emergencies without disrupting immunization services.</p><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Estimated Maximum Number of Doses Administered Per Immunization Session at the PHC/FHCs during the Lockdowns [Original]</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="IJCM-50-54_Suppl1.tif" id="d67e1561" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Pie-chart Depicting Personal Reactions of Beneficiaries&#8217; Parents to Information of Resumption of Immunization Services in 2020 [Original]</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="IJCM-50-54_Suppl2.tif" id="d67e1566" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Rajib Dasgupta, Professor, Centre for Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University for guiding me through this MPhil Dissertation.
