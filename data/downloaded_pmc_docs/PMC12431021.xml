A total of 8 cross-sectional studies with 6,082 participants were included in this review. For this review, the eligibility criteria included studies reporting HPV prevalence or genotype-specific rates among Nepalese women; thus, database sources were searched up to December 2024. The quality of the studies was assessed, and pooled estimates were computed via random effects models. The pooled prevalence of HPV infection among Nepalese women was 8.31%, with a genotype-specific prevalence of 2.62% for HPV-16 and 1.25% for HPV-18. HPV infection was significantly associated with those whose husbands had multiple sexual exposures. Other factors, including smoking status, educational status, and the use of contraceptives, were not significantly associated. Most analyses showed moderate to high heterogeneity. This review highlights the moderate burden of HPV infection in Nepal; hence, targeted public health intervention through vaccination and screening programs is recommended. Limitations include heterogeneity of studies and an inability to draw causal interference because all the data were cross-sectional. The findings highlight the need for region-specific strategies to combat HPV-related diseases in Nepal and underscore the importance of future research to address existing knowledge gaps. This review is registered in PROSPERO with registration number CRD42025632655.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref rid="sec016" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref rid="sec016" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexually transmitted infection caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) is common worldwide, with high-risk types&#8212;particularly HPV-16 and HPV-18&#8212;strongly linked to cervical cancer and other anogenital malignancies. In 2020, cervical cancer was the fourth leading cancer among women worldwide, accounting for approximately 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Cervical cancer is a major public health problem in Nepal. A population-based study from rural Nepal reported an overall prevalence of HPV of 14.4%, with 7.9% attributed to high-risk types [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A study among urban and semiurban women in the south-central plains of Nepal reported a prevalence of high-risk HPV at 8.6% [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These studies revealed the high burden of infection due to HPV across various regions of the country.</p><p>Despite the availability of preventative measures against HPV and cervical screening, coverage in Nepal remains inadequate; a 2022 study across five tertiary hospitals in Kathmandu reported that only 1.5% of women had received the HPV vaccine and just 22.2% had ever undergone a Pap smear test for cervical cancer screening. Several studies have identified sociocultural barriers, including misconceptions regarding screening and prevalent stigma, which act as barriers to the participation of women in screening programs [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Lack of education about cervical cancer and its prevention adds to the dismal state of uptake for screening services [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Geographical challenges and financial constraints also hinder access to healthcare facilities providing such services [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Addressing multifaceted barriers will surely help improve the coverage of HPV vaccination and screening for cervical cancer in Nepal. A study carried out in midwestern Nepal revealed a higher prevalence of high-risk HPV infection (11.7%) than in other regions; HPV-16 was the most prevalent genotype [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, region-specific strategies for addressing diseases related to HPV are needed.</p><p>Understanding the prevalence and genotype distribution of HPV infection in Nepal is important for the development of effective public health strategies, targeted vaccinations, and screening programs. Given the high burden of HPV-related diseases and the low use of preventive measures, a comprehensive review of existing studies on HPV prevalence in Nepal is warranted.</p><p>The goal of this systematic review is to comprehensively analyse the prevalence and distribution of HPV infection among Nepalese women and explore the rates of prevalence as presented and compared with global and regional rates. It also aims to identify the major HPV genotypes reported within the country and their prevalence.</p><p>This paper therefore systematically reviewed the literature to provide a comprehensive overview of HPV prevalence in Nepal, identify gaps in current knowledge, and generate recommendations for future research and public health interventions, thus contributing to a better understanding of HPV epidemiology in Nepal and to the elaboration of future public health guidelines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study protocol</title><p>The study protocol, with well-defined methodology and inclusion criteria, was registered on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42025632655.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Search strategy</title><p>This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the principles of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, as described in the <xref rid="pone.0332214.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Appendix</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332214.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Appendix</xref>.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that systematically synthesizes evidence on HPV infection in the Nepali population and thus provides useful insights into the scope of this public health challenge.</p><p>Among the 6082 participants included in this meta-analysis, 608 were identified with HPV infection, resulting in a pooled prevalence of 8.31% (95% CI: 5.8&#8211;10.8%) using a random-effects model due to substantial heterogeneity (I&#178;&#8201;=&#8201;91.86%, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001). This prevalence aligns with some regional studies but differs in magnitude when compared to global averages. For example, Bruni et al. (2010) [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], in a large-scale global meta-analysis using data from the ICO HPV Information Centre, reported an overall HPV prevalence of 11.7% among women with normal cytology, which is slightly higher than the estimate in our study. In contrast, Clifford et al. (2005) [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported even wider variability, with prevalence estimates ranging from 2% in Western Asia to over 20% in sub-Saharan Africa, reflecting the influence of geography, screening uptake, and sexual behavior patterns. Within South Asia, studies have generally reported HPV prevalence between 7&#8211;12%, as seen in primary studies from India [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which support the comparability of our findings with regional data. However, some community-based studies in rural Indian populations have reported lower rates (~4&#8211;6%), likely due to conservative sexual behavior and under-detection due to limited access to sensitive testing methods.</p><p>For genotype-specific analysis, like the global scenario, HPV-16 and HPV-18 remain the most common high-risk genotypes in Nepal as well. However, the pooled prevalence of HPV-16 was 2.62% (95% CI: 0.6&#8211;4.6%), and HPV-18 was 1.25% (95% CI: 0.5&#8211;2.0%). These are slightly lower than global estimates from de Sanjos&#233; et al. (2010) [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], who found HPV-16 and 18 in 3.2% and 1.4%, respectively, among women without cervical lesions, and much lower compared to cancer populations where HPV-16 alone is detected in 53.5% of cervical cancer cases globally. Primary studies among healthy Indian women [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have also reported similar genotype-specific prevalence with HPV-16 ranging between 2&#8211;4% and HPV-18 between 1&#8211;2%, which corroborates our findings. In contrast, studies from high-income countries such as the United States, as reported by Dunne et al. (2007) [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], have shown higher genotype prevalence, particularly in younger women, due to broader screening practices and more active sexual behavior in younger cohorts.</p><p>The high heterogeneity observed in genotype-specific prevalence (I&#178;&#8201;=&#8201;94.26% for HPV-16 and I&#178;&#8201;=&#8201;77.36% for HPV-18) across studies included in this meta-analysis is consistent with previous systematic reviews, such as those by Clifford et al. (2005) [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Bruni et al. (2010) [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which also highlighted wide inter-study variability due to differences in age structure, population setting (urban vs rural), laboratory assays, and sexual health practices. Some studies included only married women or had limited age ranges, while others varied in whether clinician-collected or self-collected samples were used, further contributing to the heterogeneity. While the direction of estimates is similar across studies, the variation in magnitude emphasizes the need for context-specific public health strategies.</p><p>These findings reinforce the global understanding that HPV-16 and 18 are the most prevalent high-risk genotypes and are appropriately targeted by current vaccines. The pooled prevalence estimates provide baseline data for evaluating HPV vaccination impact in South Asia. As several countries, including Nepal and India, have recently incorporated HPV vaccination into their national immunization schedules [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], continuous surveillance and comparison with pre-vaccine baseline prevalence, such as the one established in this analysis, will be critical for monitoring program effectiveness.</p><p>Several findings from this review are in agreement with existing literature. The analysis revealed a significant association between husbands having multiple sexual partners and an increased risk of HPV infection in their wives. This supports global findings that highlight the importance of spousal sexual behavior in HPV transmission. Although higher odds were observed among those with multiple sexual partners, the strength of this association varied due to limitations in statistical precision. Other investigated risk factors&#8212;including smoking, educational status, history of STIs, and contraceptive use&#8212;were not found to be significantly associated with HPV infection in this review. Moderate variability across studies, particularly regarding educational status, suggests these findings should be interpreted with caution. Regarding contraceptive use, our analysis did not find a significant association with HPV infection, which is consistent with Coker et al. (2001) [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], who found no link between hormonal contraceptive use and cervical lesions after adjusting for HPV status. While our study did not find smoking to be a significant risk factor, Bowden et al. (2023) [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] noted suggestive evidence for an association with HPV incidence, though the strength of the evidence was limited by study quality. On educational status, our findings showed no significant association with HPV infection, which contrasts with Thanasas et al. (2022) [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], who demonstrated that higher socioeconomic and educational indicators were associated with greater HPV awareness and vaccine acceptance. These comparisons suggest that while some behavioral risk factors, such as partner sexual behavior, are consistently linked to HPV infection, others&#8212;like smoking, contraception, and education&#8212;may influence awareness and preventive practices more than infection rates themselves, and may vary across populations and study designs.</p><p>The analysis revealed considerable heterogeneity across studies reflecting differences in study designs and populations; therefore, large-scale and standardized studies are needed to provide more precise estimates of the prevalence and a better understanding of the epidemiology of HPV.</p><p>The overall prevalence of HPV infection in Nepal indicates a moderate but meaningful public health burden, with HPV genotypes 16 and 18 being the most commonly identified high-risk types.</p><p>This meta-analysis has several limitations at both the study and review levels. A major limitation at the study level was that the cross-sectional nature of all included studies inhibits the inference of a causal relationship between the analysed risk factors and HPV infection. Considerable heterogeneity was observed across studies, particularly for prevalence estimates and certain risk factors such as educational status. This variability likely reflects differences in study design, population characteristics, and methodological approaches, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, factors like migration status and contraceptive use showed high variability, potentially due to inconsistent measurement or underreporting in primary studies. Owing to differences in sampling, design, measurement, and statistical analysis, this is not uncommon in reviews of observational studies [<xref rid="pone.0332214.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. At the level of review, studies with limited access may have been missed. In addition, the included studies may have suffered from reporting bias, which may have led to the overestimation of the findings.</p><p>While these are limitations, the strength lies in attempt to synthesize comprehensive data on the prevalence of HPV, genotype distribution, and associated risk factors in Nepal, addressing a significant gap in the regional literature. By contextualizing the findings from a local and a global perspective, this meta-analysis provides take-home messages for clinicians, policy makers, and researchers.</p><p>The findings of this study have critical implications for stakeholders. These results remind healthcare workers that the emphasis needs to be on prevention, which involves not only appropriate vaccination but also education regarding behavioural risks such as spousal sexual history. Policymakers can use such insights to plan resource allocation with regard to HPV vaccination and screening programs in rural and underserved areas. Importantly, the public should be sensitive to safe sexual practices, regular screening, and prevention strategies with respect to HPV infection.

The stated a number of other specific objectives among which were to explore the methods of screening adopted in the studies reviewed and compare findings on prevalence with regional and global figures.</p><p>Their review protocol and its methodology were duly registered and the aim was to calculate a pooled prevalence/proportion which will provide insights into the epidemiology of HPV infection among Nepalese women and contribute to improvements in public health actions against these disease. They also hoped to describe the associated factors of HPV infection which will help contextualize preventive efforts.</p><p>They were fairly successful in describing the burden of HPV and identifying associated factors from previous literature. They adhered in large parts to the registered methodology and the estimated pooled prevalence was largely reflective of the described methodology.</p><p>The authors were able to provide a fairly accurate estimation of the prevalence of HPV infection among Nepal&#8217;s women from a systematic review of published literature in the region. This estimate is not very reliable given the high degree of heterogeneity recorded in this manuscript. They have also been able to highlight the major factors associated with HPV infections that have been documented in previous studies and hopefully focus additional research questions on those factors.</p><p>They were however not able to demonstrate the significance of these factors on the development of HPV infections among Nepal&#8217;s women.</p><p>The methodology described was appropriate for the goal of the review</p><p>but failed to communicate properly the actual steps taken to execute this methodology. While several steps described are reproducible, they were gaps in the presentation that will leave readers feeling lost and confused. The statistical analysis and results presentation followed a similar pattern with several steps not clear and their descriptions falling short of acceptable standards in reporting. While the estimation of pooled prevalence was fairly straightforwards, the description of the process and the accompany tables were not self explanatory from the write up. Similarly, the statistical excursions into the factors associated with HPV infections appeared unnecessary as the data from the reviewed studies do not support such analysis, rendering the conclusions from these analysis void. With such a significant heterogeneity in the studies, the conclusions from these analysis are not supported by the results. The stated goal to estimate a pooled prevalence is sufficiently weakened by the high degree of heterogeneity. Even though a random effects analysis was done, as stated earlier, the presentation of the analysis was not clear as well as the reporting of the results. A sensitivity analysis was not reported.</p><p>The figures and tables lacked sufficient explanatory notes and were not well presented. The quality assessment method used was not clear and the table presenting the findings was also not clear The discussion, while acknowledging the limitations of the review, did not sufficiently demonstrated how the authors have met their main goals and objectives. They did not show how their findings corroborate with established knowledge on the subjects or differs from regional and global findings.The authors also failed to address a number of their specific objectives in both the results and discussion sections. Some of their conclusions were also not supported by the presented analysis and results from this review, especially with respect to risk factors.</p><p>A major review of the manuscript is required to provide clarity, focus and valid conclusions.</p><p>**********</p><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ext-link-type="uri">what does this mean?</ext-link> ).

We have now clarified in the Results of Syntheses section that most risk factors did not show statistically significant associations, likely due to limitations such as small sample sizes, heterogeneity, and the cross-sectional nature of the included studies.</p><p>The methodology described was appropriate for the goal of the review but failed to communicate properly the actual steps taken to execute this methodology.</p><p>We appreciate your feedback. We have revised the methodology section to better communicate each step clearly, following PRISMA guidelines.</p><p>While several steps described are reproducible, they were gaps in the presentation that will leave readers feeling lost and confused.</p><p>Thank you for the insight. We have now rewritten the methodology section to ensure greater clarity and coherence for the reader, in alignment with PRISMA standards.</p><p>The statistical analysis and results presentation followed a similar pattern with several steps not clear and their descriptions falling short of acceptable standards in reporting.</p><p>We have revised the descriptions in the Results section to enhance clarity and better align with accepted standards in statistical reporting.</p><p>While the estimation of pooled prevalence was fairly straightforwards, the description of the process and the accompany tables were not self explanatory from the write up.</p><p>Thank you. We have added clearer explanations in the text, and the figure caption now clarifies that the forest plot synthesizes the pooled prevalence while the table details individual study characteristics.</p><p>Similarly, the statistical excursions into the factors associated with HPV infections appeared unnecessary as the data from the reviewed studies do not support such analysis, rendering the conclusions from these analysis void.</p><p>We understand the concern. However, we conducted these analyses only for factors with low heterogeneity and adequate data. We believe these results still contribute meaningfully and have presented them with appropriate caution.</p><p>With such a significant heterogeneity in the studies, the conclusions from these analysis are not supported by the results.</p><p>We acknowledge the limitations due to heterogeneity and have addressed this explicitly in our discussion. Where heterogeneity was high, findings were interpreted cautiously.</p><p>The stated goal to estimate a pooled prevalence is sufficiently weakened by the high degree of heterogeneity.</p><p>We agree that heterogeneity is a known challenge in meta-analyses of observational studies. We have acknowledged this in the discussion and justified the use of a random-effects model accordingly.</p><p>Even though a random effects analysis was done, as stated earlier, the presentation of the analysis was not clear as well as the reporting of the results.</p><p>Thank you. We have worked on improving the clarity of the analysis presentation and reporting of results in the revised manuscript.</p><p>A sensitivity analysis was not reported.</p><p>We appreciate the feedback. Details of the sensitivity analysis have now been included in both the Results section and Supplementary Appendix S6.</p><p>The figures and tables lacked sufficient explanatory notes and were not well presented.</p><p>Thank you for the helpful comment. We have added explanatory captions to all figures and tables to enhance clarity.</p><p>The quality assessment method used was not clear and the table presenting the findings was also not clear.</p><p>We have revised the quality assessment section for better clarity and have reformatted the presentation of the quality appraisal table accordingly.</p><p>The discussion, while acknowledging the limitations of the review, did not sufficiently demonstrated how the authors have met their main goals and objectives.</p><p>Thank you. We have updated the discussion to more clearly link the findings with the objectives of the study.</p><p>They did not show how their findings corroborate with established knowledge on the subjects or differs from regional and global findings.</p><p>We have revised the second and third paragraphs of the discussion to address this point and provide a clearer comparison with regional and global findings.</p><p>The authors also failed to address a number of their specific objectives in both the results and discussion sections.</p><p>We appreciate the feedback. We have now ensured that the objectives&#8212;including estimating prevalence, identifying knowledge gaps, and generating recommendations&#8212;are clearly addressed in both results and discussion.</p><p>Some of their conclusions were also not supported by the presented analysis and results from this review, especially with respect to risk factors.</p><p>Thank you for the important observation. We have revised the conclusions to be concise, evidence-based, and aligned strictly with our findings. Limitations are now clearly addressed.</p><p>A major review of the manuscript is required to provide clarity, focus and valid conclusions.</p><p>We sincerely thank you for your comprehensive feedback.

Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English??&gt;</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;Yes</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold> &#160;The authors have made a good attempt at implementing the comments from the previous review. The article is clearer and more concise with better presentation of the methodology. There are improvements in the presentation of results section, with more information provided on the statistical analysis conducted. Overall, the manuscript is acceptable for publication with minor revisions.</p><p>The section of the introduction that describes the goals on this review(Lines69 -78) should be revised to capture only those goals archived by the article. For example, the authors stated in their second specific objective(line73-74) their desire to correlate major HPV genotypes with cytological abnormalities of the cervix. This goal was not addressed nor was it achieved. Similarly, the objective to assess the epidemiological study designs for methodological strength and weaknesses was also not addressed in this article. The efforts at determining the quality of studies to be included in the study can not be said to have satisfied this objective.</p><p>A major methodological limitation of this article is the number of eligible studies included as well as the type of study design. They also failed to assess the studies for reporting bias. This may have further reduced the number of studies included.</p><p>The results section, while better presented, still lacks sufficient clarity and is difficult to follow. It will benefit from a few tables that adequately capture the relevant results of the analysis, and better description of findings. The over-reliance on figures directly exported from statistical software and without appropriate footnotes that explain them undermines the efforts at explaining the results. The reader, if not sufficiently knowledgeable will find it hard to understand this section. The authors should present important findings in tables with explanatory summaries under them to enable the reader appreciate the results being presented. A few figures that supports this important findings and significant negatives may remain to aid this process.</p><p>The discussion section presented the findings from the review and efforts was made to highlight similarities between the findings and other published works. It did not sufficiently discuss the importance of the prevalence reported from this review.The focus on the associated factors (such as multiple sexual partners, contraception and smoking) took away from the import of the pooled prevalence, especially given the limitations from the types of studies selected for the review. The literature cited were insufficient and there were implied conclusions that did not exactly correlate with the cited literatures. For example, Line 274 - 278 links the findings on husband multiple sexual partners and increased risk of HPV infection with high prevalence of HPV DNA and type-specific concordance between infected women and their male partners. While this underscores spousal/partner transmission, it does not suggest husbands have multiple sexual partners. It will be helpful to elaborate this and to cite relevant studies that support the findings on multiple sexual partners.This findings on multiple sexual partners was repeated too frequently in the discussion.(lines295-298 repeats this point as well as lines 323-3255. Line 316- being the first to attempt a systematic review is not a strength of the systematic review. There is also no need to summarize the methodology again in this section(line319-323. line 323-325 is a repetition.</p><p>The authors should be commended for attempting this systematic review despite the limited number of publications that satisfied the criteria for the review.They have made efforts to compensate for this shortcoming in the various statistical analysis carried out, and have made a fair attempt at presenting and discussing the results.</p><p>**********</p><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ext-link-type="uri">what does this mean?</ext-link> ).
