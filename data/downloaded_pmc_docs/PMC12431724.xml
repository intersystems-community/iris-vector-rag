These challenges are compounded by the difficulty in accurately restoring the bone structure on the cleft side, which is crucial for achieving a balanced and aesthetically pleasing outcome. This study addressed these challenges by exploring the integration of 3-dimensional computer-aided design technology in the preoperative planning and execution of bone grafting procedures. Although the primary innovation lies in improving the precision of maxillary augmentation, the study highlighted the broader impact of such technology in overcoming the persistent difficulties in achieving postoperative symmetry. By enabling more accurate simulations and surgical planning, this approach aims to reduce variability in surgical outcomes and enhance the symmetry of the nasal and lip regions. Despite the advancements in computer-aided design technology, the study highlights the ongoing difficulties in restoring symmetry in cleft lip patients, emphasizing the need for continuous refinement of surgical techniques to achieve more consistent results. The complexities involved in these procedures highlight the importance of technological innovation in addressing the unique challenges posed by cleft-related deformities.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>COUNTRY</meta-name><meta-value>EGYPT</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>SDC</meta-name><meta-value>T</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><sec><title>Takeaways</title><p><bold>Question:</bold> How can variability in the outcomes of bone grafting of the alar base in unilateral cleft lip rhinoplasty be reduced?</p><p><bold>Findings:</bold> Three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) technology enhances the precision of bone grafting and improves preoperative planning for cleft lip nasal deformities.

The technique aims to precisely delineate the dimensions and volume of the required bone graft for repositioning the alar base through augmentation of the retruded maxilla on the cleft side. This methodology represents a novel advancement in surgical planning, offering enhanced precision and customization in addressing cleft lip nasal deformities, which can be used as part of the primary full rhinoplasty procedure or as a separate intervention following a previous rhinoplasty, depending on the patient&#8217;s specific needs and surgical goals.

</p><sec><title>Data Acquisition</title><p>Preoperatively, computed tomography scans were conducted for our patients with unilateral secondary lip nasal deformities and recessed alar base. The acquired data, in the form of DICOM files, were uploaded to 3-matic software version 13.0 and Mimics Medical software version 21.0 (Materialise, 2024).</p></sec><sec><title>Segmentation and Virtual Planning</title><p>The segmentation of bone and soft tissue was performed on the uploaded data; the Frankfurt horizontal plane and the sagittal plane were precisely identified, and a mirroring technique was used to replicate the normal side onto the cleft side, followed by subtracting the cleft side from the mirrored normal side. This process enabled the identification of precise bone deficiencies, allowing for accurate determination of volume, dimensions, shape, and site necessary for the bone graft. (<bold>See figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1</bold>, which displays the 3D identification of precise bone deficiencies through 3D-rendered DICOM visualization, enabling accurate assessment of volume, dimensions, shape, site, and thickness for bone graft planning, after mirroring and subtracting the cleft side from the normal side, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://links.lww.com/PRSGO/E318" ext-link-type="uri">https://links.lww.com/PRSGO/E318</ext-link>.) This grafting procedure is essential for repositioning the alar base to its most symmetrical site. Subsequently, the results can be translated into measures that can be used intraoperatively or translated as a tangible format using computer-aided modeling (CAM) and can be printed for reference during the surgical procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical Correction</title><p>The surgical procedure was conducted under general anesthesia. A corticocancellous bone block was harvested from the medial iliac crest. This bone block served as an onlay graft, applied to the pyriform rim of the deficient side to augment the alar base. The application was carried out through an intraoral incision, which varied based on the need for oronasal fistula closure.</p><p>The harvested bone graft underwent a crafting process using a bare drill, aligning with the predetermined virtual model that had been reconstructed with careful consideration of both volume and size. This meticulous crafting ensured that the bone graft closely adhered to the planned specifications, facilitating its optimal fit and alignment during the subsequent surgical procedure (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Intraoperative photograph showing a bone graft precisely fitted and stabilized over the caudal part of the nasal aperture on the cleft side using miniplates and screws, ensuring optimal contour and fixation.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="gox-13-e7093-g001.jpg"/></fig><p>Closure of the intraoral incision was accomplished using a 4/0 resorbable suture. Simultaneously, the hip wound was closed in layers, and an epidural catheter was inserted into the wound to facilitate the administration of a local anesthetic agent (0.25% Marcaine) for postoperative analgesia. Standard perioperative antibiotics, including 200&#8201;mg of metronidazole 3 times daily and 500&#8201;mg of phenoxymethylpenicillin 4 times daily, were administered. Patients were discharged upon achieving mobility and comfort. Follow-up appointments at the outpatient clinic occurred weekly for the initial 2 weeks to monitor wound healing and screen for potential complications.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In recent decades, the integration of computer-aided design (CAD)/CAM technology with 3D medical images (such as computed tomography scans) and medical image analysis software has revolutionized the field of craniofacial surgery. Through the use of CAD/CAM technology, surgeons can now conduct preoperative simulations of surgical procedures, enabling them to refine and finalize surgical plans before entering the operating rooms. The Postoperative symmetrical and anatomical recovery of the bone can also be obtained using the mirroring technology of CAD.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>In the domain of cleft lip and palate treatment, attention has been directed toward CAD/CAM technology, particularly in the context of nasoalveolar molding. Yu et al<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> initially introduced a novel approach to presurgical nasoalveolar molding for infants with unilateral cleft lip and palate, using CAD.</p><p>The application of CAD/CAM technology combined with bone grafting to correct nasolabial deformities has not been previously documented. Regardless of the degree or severity of unilateral cleft lip, when there is maxillary involvement causing a recessed alar base, this technique can be applied effectively due to the presence of a normal side that can be mirrored. (<bold>See figure, Supplemental Digital Content 2</bold>, which displays the 3D-rendered visualization of DICOM data illustrating the soft tissue anatomy of a patient with unilateral cleft lip nasal deformity. The image highlights the asymmetry between the cleft and noncleft sides, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://links.lww.com/PRSGO/E319" ext-link-type="uri">https://links.lww.com/PRSGO/E319</ext-link>.) (<bold>See figure, Supplemental Digital Content 3</bold>, which displays the 3D-rendered visualization of DICOM data illustrating the bony skeleton and precise determination of the sagittal plane, providing critical anatomical reference for evaluation and surgical planning, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://links.lww.com/PRSGO/E320" ext-link-type="uri">https://links.lww.com/PRSGO/E320</ext-link>.) The mirroring functionality of CAD/CAM technology allows for precise planning and correction by replicating the unaffected side, enabling the restoration of symmetry, where the unaffected side can serve as a template to plan bone grafting and reconstruct the defect. Additionally, the application of this approach extends to certain syndromic facial deformities, provided that 1 side of the face remains anatomically normal, offering a reliable reference for reconstruction. Beyond congenital cases, where this technique is best performed around 14&#8211;16 years of age, once nasal and midfacial growth is nearly complete, it also holds significant potential in acquired conditions, such as trauma or surgical resections, where it can be applied at any age, but with the understanding that further adjustments may be needed after growth completion.</p><p>This study represents the first attempt to address the correction of the recessed alar base using CAD/CAM technology alongside bone grafting. The approach aims to achieve postoperative symmetry of the pyriform aperture and significantly reduce operation duration.</p><p>In another aspect, correcting soft tissue deformities can be challenging because soft tissue healing does not always align with the recovery of the bony cartilaginous framework underneath. Factors such as thin or atrophic soft tissue and excessive scarring from previous surgery add to these difficulties. Therefore, reconstructing the orbicularis oris muscle and restoring the width of the nasal floor are essential for achieving successful results in nasolabial procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>DISCLOSURE</title><p>The authors have no financial interest to declare in relation to the content of this article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="s1" content-type="document" xlink:href="gox-13-e7093-s002.pdf" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="s2" content-type="document" xlink:href="gox-13-e7093-s003.pdf" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="s3" content-type="document" xlink:href="gox-13-e7093-s004.pdf" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Published online 12 September 2025.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
