In this study, we sought to evaluate the feasibility and validity of a test battery of eye movements as a tool to measure visual performance in individuals with VI. A test battery including fixation stability, smooth pursuit, saccades, free viewing, and visual search was administered to 46 athletes with VI and 10 control participants. Feasibility was determined by test completion rates. Construct validity was assessed by comparing eye movement outcomes across different VI subgroups, and predictive validity was evaluated by examining the relationship between eye movement metrics and in-competition sport performance. The test battery proved feasible, with 88% of athletes with VI able to complete the tests. Eye movement variables distinguished between subgroups, supporting construct validity. For example, participants with combined central and peripheral vision loss showed longer fixation durations during free viewing and visual search, while those with central vision loss had prolonged saccades during free viewing and fewer and smaller eye movements during visual search. Predictive validity was indicated by significant correlations between eye movement metrics and sport performance, suggesting that eye tracking can predict real-world outcomes. Our findings suggest that an assessment of eye movements provides a feasible, valid, and largely objective measure of the functional consequences of VI that may extend beyond what information is obtained using traditional tests of visual acuity and visual field and that those measures can help to predict the sport performance of Para athletes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>eye movements</kwd><kwd>visual function</kwd><kwd>functional vision</kwd><kwd>sport performance</kwd><kwd>vision impairment</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="23"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The accurate assessment of visual function is fundamental to the diagnosis of vision impairment (VI) and for understanding the functional consequences of that impairment on activities of daily living. Visual function refers to the measurable physiological abilities of the visual system (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Colenbrander, 2005</xref>), such as visual acuity (VA) and visual fields (VF), which are used to determine the visual capabilities of individuals with and without VI. However, these traditional measures were developed for medical, diagnostic purposes and may not capture how well individuals with and without VI use their vision in real-world settings. Alternatively, an individual's <italic toggle="yes">functional vision</italic> (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Colenbrander, 2005</xref>) reflects the ability to perform visually guided tasks in everyday life, such as those encountered in reading (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Calabr&#232;se, Bernard, Faure, Hoffart, &amp; Castet, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kabanarou &amp; Rubin, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Murata, Miyamoto, Togano, &amp; Fukuchi, 2017</xref>), driving (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bronstad, Albu, Bowers, Goldstein, &amp; Peli, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">K&#252;bler et&#160;al., n.d.</xref>), and in sports (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Land &amp; McLeod, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mann, Spratford, &amp; Abernethy, 2013</xref>). Ideally, tests of visual function predict an individual's functional vision in some way, though this might not always be the case.</p><p>Eye movements are an important aspect of visual function but have been traditionally measured by clinicians observing and grading the quality of the eye movements in a very subjective manner. Recent advances in eye-tracking technology offer new opportunities for measuring eye movements in a more precise and objective way (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gestefeld, Marsman, &amp; Cornelissen, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Grillini, Ombelet, Soans, &amp; Cornelissen, 2018</xref>). Unlike subjective assessments that rely on verbal responses or patient cooperation, eye tracking can directly measure oculomotor behavior, including fixational, smooth pursuit, and saccadic eye movements (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nieboer, Ghiani, De Vries, Brenner, &amp; Mann, 2023</xref>). These eye movements are essential components of visual function, and impairments in these abilities (e.g., through nystagmus or strabismus) have the potential to significantly impact activities of daily living (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kelly, Cheng-Patel, Jost, Wang, &amp; Birch, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Perrin Fievez, Lions, &amp; Bucci, 2018</xref>). However, the degree to which impairments to eye movements impact these activities&#8212;independent of the effects of VA and VF&#8212;remains insufficiently understood.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly common to use eye tracking to evaluate the eye movements of people with VI (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nieboer et&#160;al., 2023</xref>). <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nieboer et al. (2023)</xref> previously reviewed the literature to determine the degree to which eye tracking can be used to assess visual function in the presence of VI. The included studies reported considerable success when testing individuals with VI, yielding usable data from 96.5% of participants (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nieboer et&#160;al., 2023</xref>). The high success rate highlights the potential that eye tracking offers as a tool for assessing visual function in those with impairment; however, it might also reflect the selectiveness of the ocular conditions examined in those studies as researchers might have deliberately avoided studying ocular conditions that they might have expected to have made eye tracking difficult, for instance, in individuals with nystagmus, strabismus, or abnormal anterior segments. Hence, further investigation is needed to determine the applicability of eye tracking in a wider range of ocular conditions.</p><p>The systematic review by <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nieboer et al. (2023)</xref> also revealed a set of five common tests of eye movements that have been used in individuals with VI: (a) fixation stability, (b) smooth pursuit, (c) saccades, (d) free viewing, and (e) visual search. A test of fixation stability assesses the ability of an individual to maintain steady gaze on a specific point. A test of smooth pursuits evaluates the smoothness and accuracy of eye movements when tracking a moving target. A test of saccades measures the speed and accuracy of rapid eye movements between different fixation points. Free viewing involves observing and exploring visual stimuli without specific instructions, offering insights into spontaneous visual exploration behavior. Lastly, visual search tasks assess the efficiency of locating specific targets within a visual field, providing information on visual attention and search strategies. These tests have been proposed to collectively provide a comprehensive assessment of various aspects of visual capabilities in individuals with vision impairment.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate an eye-tracking test battery for assessing the visual capabilities of individuals with VI. We could find no existing test available that was suitable for persons with (profound) vision impairment. Therefore, we developed a battery of tests of eye movements, based on the framework outlined in <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nieboer et al. (2023)</xref>, that assessed fixation stability, smooth pursuit, saccades, free viewing, and visual search. The test battery was employed to assess the eye movements of Paralympic athletes with vision impairment. The feasibility of the test battery was evaluated by seeking to establish what proportion of individuals with VI could successfully complete the test. To establish the validity of the test battery, we focused on two main types of validity: construct validity and predictive validity. Construct validity refers to the extent to which a test accurately measures the theoretical construct it is intended to assess (e.g., visual function) and should be sensitive to variation between individuals with different types and severities of impairment (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Harris, Bird, Smart, Wilson, &amp; Vine, 2020</xref>). We hypothesized that the test battery would differentiate between healthy controls and participants with VI, as well as between those with central and peripheral vision loss. For example, we expected that participants with peripheral vision loss would show reduced performance on saccadic and visual search tests, while participants with central vision loss would perform worse on fixation stability and smooth pursuit tests.</p><p>We then assessed predictive validity, which reflects how well the test can predict an outcome external to the test itself (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Harris et&#160;al., 2020</xref>), such as reading or sport performance. Predictive validity is a subtype of criterion validity and is closely related to construct validity because, if a test measures the construct well, it should also be able to predict related real-world outcomes (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Strauss &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>). There is convincing evidence that skilled athletes use distinct eye movement <italic toggle="yes">strategies</italic> compared with less-skilled athletes (i.e., different functional vision), for instance, use of the &#8220;quiet eye&#8221; in targeting tasks (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Harle &amp; Vickers, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Vine, Moore, &amp; Wilson, 2011</xref>), more predictive strategies in hitting (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mann et&#160;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sarpeshkar, Abernethy, &amp; Mann, 2017</xref>), and more structured forms of search in complex team sports (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mann, Causer, Nakamoto, &amp; Runswick, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Vaeyens, Lenoir, Williams, Mazyn, &amp; Philippaers, 2007</xref>). But the evidence is much less clear as to whether better athletes have better <italic toggle="yes">visual function</italic>, that is, a better capacity to perform, for instance, more accurate or faster eye movements (for some evidence, see studies in fast ball sports [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Liu, Burris, &amp; Appelbaum, 2020</xref>] and in complex team sports [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Morgan &amp; Patterson, 2009</xref>]). In athletes with vision impairment, it seems reasonable to expect that reduced visual function will, at some point, impact sport performance, even in less visually demanding sports such as judo (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Krabben, Mann, et&#160;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Krabben, Mashkovskiy, Ravensbergen, &amp; Mann, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Krabben, Ravensbergen, et&#160;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Krabben, Ravensbergen, Nakamoto, &amp; Mann, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Krabben et&#160;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Krabben, van der Kamp, &amp; Mann, 2018</xref>), swimming (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fortin-Guichard, Ravensbergen, Krabben, Allen, &amp; Mann, 2022</xref>), and track athletics (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Zenk, Willmott, Fortin-Guichard, Mann, &amp; Allen, 2025</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Zenk, Willmott, Mann, &amp; Allen, 2024</xref>). Little is known though about how <italic toggle="yes">eye movements</italic> might relate to sports performance in athletes with VI. Given that eye movement deficits are often present in VI, we hypothesized that athletes with greater impairments, as measured by the eye-tracking battery, would exhibit poorer sport performance. Our choice to test the relationship in two sports which would be considered less visually demanding (i.e., swimming and track athletics) also provides a robust test of the predictive validity of the test battery.</p><p>By establishing both construct and predictive validity, we sought to demonstrate the effectiveness of the eye-tracking battery as a tool for assessing the functional consequences of VI. In our case, we sought to establish predictive validity in Para athletes as a group of young individuals who are well adjusted to their impairment, but we clearly see the potential for the tool to predict the functional ability of all persons with vision impairment. Ultimately, we hope that the results will improve the way functional vision is assessed in the presence of VI and the way that impact on real-world activities is understood.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 56 participants took part in the study: 46 athletes with vision impairment (15 females; age = 25.3 &#177; 6.7 years) and a control group of 10 healthy young adults (7 females; age = 21.7 &#177; 4.6 years) who volunteered during Para sport events. The athletes were recruited through Para sport events (Para Track Athletics and Para Swimming) organized for athletes with a vision impairment. Athletes with vision impairment have reduced or no vision that is caused by damage to the eye structure, optical nerves or optical pathways, or visual cortex of the brain (<xref rid="bib26a" ref-type="bibr">International Paralympic Committee, n.d.</xref>). The minimum impairment criteria for athletes with vision impairment to compete in Para sport events is a visual acuity of 1.0 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) or worse, or a visual field restricted to 40 degrees in diameter or less. There were no specific exclusion criteria for our study based on the type of ocular condition, but athletes with a visual acuity worse than 2.60 logMAR in their better eye&#8212;those in sport class B1&#8212;were excluded from the study because their vision was likely to be too poor to discriminate any stimulus presented to them on a screen. Sport class represents the grouping of athletes based on how their impairment impacts their sport performance, aiming to minimize the influence of impairment on competition outcomes (<xref rid="bib26a" ref-type="bibr">International Paralympic Committee, n.d.</xref>). Athletes with vision impairment are typically grouped into three classes (<xref rid="bib26a" ref-type="bibr">International Paralympic Committee, n.d.</xref>):

This information was accessed through the Sport Data Management System of the International Paralympic Committee. The sample of participants included individuals with various causes of vision impairment, such as Stargardt disease, retinitis pigmentosa, high myopia, optic atrophy, congenital cataract, and amblyopia, among others. Additional details regarding participant characteristics can be found in <xref rid="jovi-25-11-5_s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. To help with the categorization of the conditions, we manually classified the type of each participant's impairment based on their medical documentation. An optometrist and a vision scientist independently labeled each participant as having healthy vision, central vision loss, peripheral vision loss, or combined central and peripheral vision loss. We additionally annotated those with nystagmus or strabismus. Cohen's kappa was calculated to measure interrater reliability, and cases of disagreement were discussed between the two raters until consensus was reached on the most appropriate categorization for that individual.</p><p>The study was approved by the Scientific and Ethical Review Board of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki with the informed consent of all participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Apparatus and materials</title><p>The eye movement data were collected using a Pupil Invisible head-mounted infrared eye-tracker (Pupil Labs GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The eye tracker recorded the eye movements of both eyes of participants at a sampling rate of 200 Hz. This eye-tracking system employs an artificial intelligence&#8211;based algorithm that circumvents the explicit detection of two-dimensional features and instead performs gaze estimation by directly regressing gaze estimates from concurrent eye images (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Tonsen, Baumann, &amp; Dierkes, 2020</xref>), eliminating the need for any manual calibration, which can be specifically challenging for individuals with vision impairment (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nieboer et&#160;al., 2023</xref>). The reported spatial accuracy of the Pupil Invisible is 4.6 degrees uncalibrated (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Tonsen et&#160;al., 2020</xref>). We conducted a verification process to check the accuracy of the automated calibration. A grid of five circles, each with a diameter of approximately 14 degrees, was presented on a screen to the participants. Participants were instructed to direct their central vision (or preferred retinal locus if central vision was not available) toward each circle in the grid one by one. Any calibration offset observed during this verification process was manually corrected using the Pupil Invisible software. For participants with VI, tracking accuracy may be affected by factors such as eccentric fixation, nystagmus, or strabismus. Given that individuals with central vision loss often use preferred retinal loci, gaze recordings may not always correspond to intended fixation points.</p><p>The visual stimuli for the experiment were presented on an Acer Nitro xv273xb monitor, which had a screen size of 27 inches and a resolution of 1,920 &#215; 1,080 pixels. The monitor had a high refresh rate of 240 Hz, ensuring smooth and precise presentation of stimuli. The stimuli were presented using a custom-built tool developed in PsychoPy (Version 2021.2.3).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Procedure</title><p>During the experiment, participants wore the head-mounted eye tracker and sat 60 cm from the monitor (subtending a visual angle of 55.3 degrees and 34.7 degrees in width and height, respectively). All tests and eye movement recordings were conducted binocularly. Participants were instructed to minimize their head movements, but their head was not restricted in any way.</p><p>The test battery consisted of five different tests of eye movements, all of which were to be attempted by all participants. These paradigms, designed based on the systematic review by <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nieboer et al. (2023)</xref>, included tests of (a) fixation stability, (b) smooth pursuit, (c) saccades, (d) free viewing, and (e) visual search. The tests were also administered in this order. Participants were given short breaks between each test to rest. The total duration of all tests combined, including breaks, was approximately 30 minutes.</p><sec id="sec2-3-1"><title>Fixation stability</title><p>The test of fixation stability assessed the ability to maintain steady fixation on a target (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bellmann, Feely, Crossland, Kabanarou, &amp; Rubin, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Crossland, Sims, Galbraith, &amp; Rubin, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ghasia et&#160;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Murray et&#160;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Tarita-Nistor et&#160;al., 2017</xref>). The fixation target was a white cross consisting of a single horizontal and vertical line (thickness = 1 degree of visual angle) that spanned the full width and height of the screen, respectively, and, within the white cross, an inner black cross with lines of 0.4 degrees visual angle. The background was black. The design of the target allowed participants to locate and direct their gaze toward the center of the cross, even in the presence of a central scotoma. Participants were instructed to maintain steady fixation on the center of the cross until it disappeared. The cross was presented for 30 seconds. Participants were instructed to limit their head movements and minimize blinking during the task. The initial 2 seconds of the test were excluded from analysis in case participants were still locating the center of the cross during that period.</p><p>Stability was measured using the bivariate contour ellipse area (BCEA). The BCEA quantifies the spread of fixation points by calculating the area of an ellipse that encompasses fixation points for a given proportion of all eye positions during the test.

Initially, a white fixation dot (diameter 1 degree) was presented at the center of the screen, against a black background, for a duration of 1.5 seconds if the target were to move vertically over the screen or 2 seconds if the target were to move horizontally. The difference in delay ensured that each trial had the same total duration since horizontal targets were presented for 0.5 seconds longer. Subsequently, the fixation dot disappeared, and a target dot with a diameter of 1 degree appeared at a location 6 degrees away from the fixation point, at 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees. After a delay of 0.5 seconds, the target dot began to move in the direction of the center of the screen with a constant velocity of 10 degrees per second. If the target moved vertically, its duration was set to 1.25 seconds, while for horizontally moving targets, the duration was 1.75 seconds to optimally use the size of the screen in both directions (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Natela et&#160;al., 2020</xref>). Following the specified duration, the target dot vanished, and the fixation dot reappeared, marking the start of a new trial.</p><p>During the test, each target location was presented five times, in a random order, resulting in a total of 20 trials. Participants were instructed to shift their gaze from the fixation dot to the target dot and to track the target dot when it started moving.</p><p>Smooth pursuit performance was assessed by calculating the gain, which in this case represents the ratio of eye velocity during target pursuit to the velocity of the target. A gain of 1.0 indicates perfect average pursuit. Smooth pursuit gain was calculated across the entire trial, including both the open-loop and closed-loop phases. The open-loop phase was difficult to define, particularly for participants with nystagmus, whose eye movements lack a stable period. Trials were not excluded based on target interception, as some participants may have relied on nonfoveal retinal locations that were not accounted for in the eye-tracking calibration. Gain variability within individual trials was not analyzed; instead, saccade detection was used as an indirect measure of smooth pursuit consistency. The number of saccades, which typically occur as catch-up saccades when the eye's velocity is insufficient to track the target, was counted, and the amplitudes of these saccades were determined.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3-3"><title>Saccades</title><p>A step paradigm was used to assess saccades (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Fayel et&#160;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Giacomelli et&#160;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Niechwiej-Szwedo, Chandrakumar, Goltz, &amp; Wong, 2012</xref>). The paradigm began with a white fixation dot (diameter 1 degree) initially displayed at the center of the screen against a black background. The dot remained visible for 1.5 seconds before it disappeared and immediately reappeared as a target dot at a specific location away from the center of the screen, remained visible for 2 seconds, and then disappeared again. The dot then immediately reappeared at the center of the screen as a fixation dot, marking the beginning of a new trial. There were 16 possible locations for the target dot to appear away from the center of the screen, positioned either 6 or 10 degrees away from the center in one of eight directions from the fixation dot (i.e., at 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees).</p><p>During the test, each target location was presented twice in a random order, resulting in a total of 32 trials. Participants were instructed to shift their gaze from the fixation dot to the target dot when it appeared and vice versa.</p><p>From the saccade paradigm, the number of saccades per trial was extracted. While one saccade per trial is expected in a healthy population, multiple saccades per trial suggest difficulties in locating peripheral targets (e.g., peripheral vision loss). Additional variables extracted from the saccade data included peak velocity, saccadic reaction time (the time delay between target onset and saccade onset), and saccadic gain. Saccadic gain was calculated by dividing the amplitude of the primary saccade by the amplitude of the target step (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Raashid, Wong, Chandrakumar, Blakeman, &amp; Goltz, 2013</xref>).

In the first part, participants were presented with a series of 30 photos, each displayed for a duration of 3 seconds. The photos encompassed a diverse range of themes, including scenes from nature landscapes, cityscapes, and sports events. The photos varied in composition, with some featuring cluttered scenes and others focusing on central objects or individuals. Most of the photos were in full color (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 27), while the remainder were black and white. Each photo occupied the entire screen, with dimensions of 1,920 by 1,080 pixels. The selection of photos ensured a wide range of saliency across different regions of the screen, capturing participants&#8217; attention and prompting exploratory eye movements.</p><p>In the second part, participants watched a single video of planes taxiing, preparing for take-off, and stationary planes, while various vehicles, such as fueling cars, moved between the planes at different speeds. The video content was highly dynamic, featuring objects appearing on the screen from various directions. The dynamic nature of the video was designed to elicit reactionary and tracking eye movements. The video lasted 52 seconds and was displayed in full screen.</p><p>Participants were instructed to simply watch the photos and videos without any specific task or response required from them. All participants viewed the same photos and video.</p><p>From the paradigm, the following eye movement measures were extracted per trial: average number of fixations, average duration of fixations, average number of saccades, average duration of saccades, amplitude of the largest saccade, and average amplitude of saccades. The scan path, which quantifies the exploration of the scene, was calculated by summing the amplitudes of all saccades. The scan path provides insight into how efficiently a participant explores a visual scene.

The test assesses the ability to identify the presence of a circle among a grid of squares. The visual search test comprised three levels of difficulty. In the easiest level, participants were presented with a 3-by-3 grid of white shapes on a black background. Each shape subtended an angle of 8.3 degrees of visual angle (equivalent to 2.0 logMAR). In the second level, an 8-by-8 grid was used, with shapes subtending an angle of 2.6 degrees of visual angle (equivalent to 1.5 logMAR). The third and most challenging level consisted of a 15-by-15 grid, with shapes subtending an angle of 0.83 degrees of visual angle (equivalent to 1.0 logMAR).</p><p>During each trial, the stimuli were presented for a maximum of 30 seconds. Participants were required to respond whether a circle was present or not as quickly as possible by pressing the left or right key on a keyboard, respectively. Prior to the full test, participants completed six familiarization trials using the easiest test level, where the circle was present four times.</p><p>The full test consisted of 18 trials for each level of difficulty, with the circle being present in 12 of the 18 trials. The order of the trials within each level of difficulty was randomized between participants. For data analysis, the most difficult level completed by each participant was used. A level was considered completed if the response accuracy was above chance level (7 out of 12 correctly identified circles, and 3 out of 6 correctly identified the absence of circles). Measures of performance were the number of correct answers and average response time on the most difficult level completed. Additionally, eye movements during the search were extracted; these included average number of fixations per second, average duration of fixations, average number of saccades per second, average duration of saccades, amplitude of the largest saccade, average amplitude of saccades, and scan path in degrees per second.</p><p>For all 40 dependent variables, the average over all trials (if applicable) was used for further data analysis.

Blinks and fixations were automatically detected by the Pupil Labs software. Blinks were removed from the data. We adopted the saccade detection algorithm used in Ghiani et al. (2024). The gaze data were first smoothed by fitting a second-order polynomial (Savitzky&#8211;Golay) to the data using least squares regression within a window of 0.02 seconds. This allowed us to calculate the velocity and acceleration of the eyes at each moment. Velocity was computed by taking the first-order derivative of the polynomial fits to the horizontal and vertical gaze data, squaring these derivatives, and summing them. Acceleration was similarly computed by taking the second-order derivative of the polynomial fits, squaring these derivatives, and summing them. We then ranked these velocity and acceleration values and computed probabilities for each. The ranks were transformed into probabilities using a power function where ranks were raised to the power of 6.58. This transformation was designed such that only the top 10% of the ranked velocities and accelerations have a probability greater than 0.5. To identify saccades, we thresholded these probabilities: Values above 0.5 indicated potential saccades. We refined this identification by ensuring the orientation of the saccade was consistent in a straight line. To achieve this, we calculated the overall direction vector of the saccade by determining its horizontal and vertical components. We then computed the dot product between the segment vectors within the saccade and the overall direction vector. Any segment that deviated from the overall direction vector, as indicated by a negative dot product, was excluded from being classified as part of a saccade. Additionally, we ensured that consecutive saccades were separated by at least 50 ms. If two saccades were closer together, they were combined into one if the angular separation between their directions was less than 150 degrees, unless they were in the same direction (within 45 degrees); in this case, the smaller of the two saccades was discarded. This approach prioritizes larger saccades to capture meaningful eye movements while minimizing oversegmentation from noise, microsaccades, nystagmus, or small corrective shifts. Finally, we required that the amplitude of the overall change in eye orientation during a saccade was at least 1 degree. Saccades that did not meet this criterion were discarded.</p><p>We used this customized saccade detection algorithm because a simpler threshold algorithm based on velocity and/or acceleration is very sensitive to noise, especially in the presence of ocular conditions such as nystagmus (see&#160;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>). A low threshold might identify nystagmus eye movements as saccades, while a high threshold could lead to missed saccades (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dai, Cham, &amp; Abel, 2021</xref>). In our analysis, we used adaptive thresholds by ranking velocity and acceleration values. In our analysis, we used an additional directional consistency check, which ensures that detected saccades follow a single trajectory rather than reversing direction, as occurs in nystagmus. The analysis was conducted using Python Version 3.9.7.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>An example trial from the test of saccades performed by Participant 11, who exhibited nystagmus eye movements.

To reduce the dimensionality of the data and to identify distinct aspects of visual function from the eye movement variables, a principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted. The data were log-transformed to reduce variance and standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. The PCA was performed to obtain the principal components; the explained variance ratio was calculated, and a scree plot was generated to determine the number of components to retain.</p><p>We ran k-means clustering to identify potential subgroups among participants. K-means clustering was performed on the loadings obtained via the PCA. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method, which assessed the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for different numbers of clusters. We then initialized the k-means algorithm with the number of clusters determined using the elbow method. The quality of the clustering was expressed by the silhouette score. We created cluster profiles by calculating and comparing per cluster the averages of the eye movement variables that had an absolute loading of 0.25 or higher on one of the principal components.</p><p>To assess the normality and homogeneity of variance assumptions, Shapiro&#8211;Wilk's test and Levene's test, respectively, were conducted on the eye movement variables.

For the saccadic characteristics (PC3), participants in Cluster 3 had prolonged saccade durations during free viewing of the photos (Cluster 1 <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 45.54 ms, Cluster 2 <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 55.98 ms) and videos (Cluster 1 <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 58.14 ms, Cluster 2 <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 70.81 ms). For visual search (PC4), the participants in Cluster 3 had significantly longer fixation durations when free viewing the videos (Cluster 1 <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 0.83 s, Cluster 2 <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 1.31 s), shorter scan path during the test of visual search (Cluster 1 <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 2.29 deg, Cluster 2 <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 0.97 deg), and smaller saccades during the test of saccades (Cluster 1 <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 4.32, Cluster 2 <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 3.19 deg). In sum, the participants in Cluster 3, who were more likely to have central vision loss only, typically used longer fixation durations, had shorter and slower scan paths, had poor fixation stability, and produced saccades that were shorter yet of longer duration and lower velocity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Predicting sport performance</title><p>A forward stepwise linear regression model was employed to investigate the relationship between visual acuity, the eye movement variables, and sport performance. In the initial step, we only included visual acuity in the best and worse eye as features.

We sought to evaluate the suitability of this newly developed test using eye tracking in individuals with VI. Forty-six Para athletes with VI and 10 individuals without impairment were recruited to complete the test battery. The participant sample included individuals with a range of causes of vision impairment, including Stargardt disease, retinitis pigmentosa, high myopia, optic atrophy, congenital cataracts, and cone/rod dystrophy, among others. Of the recruited participants with VI, 88% were able to complete the test battery, suggesting good feasibility. To test construct validity, principal component analysis revealed four main components, which explained about half the variance in the data. We characterized those components as scanning during free viewing (PC1), fixation characteristics (PC2), saccade characteristics (PC3), and visual search rates (PC4). Based on these components, three distinct groups were identified through k-means clustering: (a) participants with healthy (central) vision, (b) participants with combined central and peripheral vision loss, and (c) participants with central vision loss. Significant differences in eye movement patterns across these groups suggest that the assessment of eye movements provided valuable, largely objective insights into the functional consequences of VI. Finally, to test predictive validity, the variables derived from eye tracking were related to the sport performance of the participants. We found that the eye-tracking variables combined with visual acuity were effective in predicting the running and swimming performance of the athletes, while visual acuity alone could not. Therefore, the addition of results from eye tracking to visual acuity better explained an aspect of real-world behavior than what was possible when using visual acuity alone. Collectively, these results provide a promising reason to believe that eye tracking could be used more widely as a means of assessing visual capabilities in a systematic and largely objective manner.</p><sec id="sec4-1"><title>Feasibility of the test battery</title><p>The first step in the evaluation of the newly developed test battery was to assess its feasibility. Out of the 43 recruited athletes with VI who met the inclusion criteria, 38 (88.4%) were able to complete the whole test battery. In a previous review of the eye-tracking literature (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nieboer et&#160;al., 2023</xref>), it was found that eye-tracking data were usable for 96.5% of 870 participants with VI across 41 studies, although there was a notable overrepresentation of conditions such as glaucoma and macular degeneration, and fewer studies included participants with less common or more severe forms of vision impairment (e.g., corneal scarring, retinopathy, or retinitis pigmentosa). Considering that the current study, which had no exclusion criteria based on ocular conditions and included a broader range of impairment severities with a minimum visual acuity of 1.0 logMAR or a visual field restricted to 40 degrees or less, the success rate of 88.4% using our test battery suggests it is a feasible tool to test many individuals with VI. Exclusions were primarily due to participants having too severely impaired vision to perform the test properly or for wearing spectacles that were too thick for the eye tracker to register the eye movements. The two excluded cases who could not see the stimuli on the screen at a 60-cm distance had an average VA of 2.0 &#177; 0.21 logMAR in the best eye and 2.4 &#177; 0.14 logMAR in the worst eye. We did, however, successfully collect data for two individuals with VA worse than 2.0 logMAR (<italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 2.15 logMAR). The two excluded cases for which the glasses were too thick had a correction of +8.00 and +6.00 spherical. We expect that if our test battery is employed within these VA and optical correction boundaries (VA &lt; 2.0 logMAR and correction &lt; +6.00 spherical, respectively), then the success rate would indeed increase. Alternative approaches could be to replace the lenses from the eye-tracking glasses with prescription lenses or for participants to wear contact lenses if possible. Furthermore, for individuals with VA greater than 2.0 logMAR, their visual capabilities are likely to be very limited already and may therefore not require a comprehensive assessment to detect nuances in eye movements. Taken together, the calibration-free eye tracker that we used proved relatively robust across a diverse range of ocular conditions&#8212;including some very extreme cases of strabismus, nystagmus (including rotary nystagmus), corneal scarring, and cataracts&#8212;and different severities, demonstrating its feasibility for assessing visual capabilities in athletes with a wide range of ocular conditions and vision impairments.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2"><title>Construct validity</title><p>Our analysis revealed that the test battery of eye movements has good construct validity in that it is sensitive to differences in functional impairment between athletes. We used PCA to identify components in the eye movement variables and then cluster analysis to group participants according to their performance on those variables. Encouragingly, all 10 individuals without impairment were clustered into the same group, in addition to 4 individuals with peripheral vision loss. This result provides the first evidence for construct validity. Further, participants in the two additional clusters were characterized by differences in their ocular conditions. In particular, those with combined central and peripheral vision loss (Cluster 2) had eye movement patterns distinct from those with largely central (Cluster 3) or peripheral vision loss only (within Cluster 1). These results align with our theoretical expectations, reflecting how different impairment types impact visual capabilities such as eye movements in different ways (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nieboer et&#160;al., 2023</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that eye movement profiles can serve as valid indicators of specific types of VI, underscoring the test battery's potential utility as a largely objective tool for both classification and clinical applications.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-3"><title>Predictive validity</title><p>The predictive validity of the test battery of eye movements was good, where eye-tracking variables in combination with visual acuity had a good ability to predict the running and swimming performance of the athletes with VI. In a regression analysis using a stepwise approach, we related visual function features to the in-competition sport performance of the athletes. The initial features alone, visual acuity in each eye, did not yield a significant model of prediction (see also <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fortin-Guichard et&#160;al., 2022</xref>). However, when iteratively adding variables derived from eye tracking, we obtained a significant prediction model with six features that explained over half of the variance in sport performance, providing evidence for the predictive validity of the test battery. This result suggests that eye tracking is a valuable addition to traditional assessment in understanding the impact of VI on the performance of real-world tasks, in this case, sport performance. To what degree those findings generalize to other activities of daily living remains an open question.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-4"><title>Interpretation of the eye movement characteristics in relation to sport performance</title><p>Our findings indicate that specific eye movement characteristics are significantly associated with sport performance in Para athletes, providing evidence for the relevance of eye tracking for the assessment of functional vision. While caution is required to not overgeneralize the findings, particularly given the risk of overfitting in our model, we here provide a speculative interpretation of the findings. The strong positive association between fixation duration during free viewing and slower race times could suggest that prolonged fixations reflect a less efficient visual processing strategy. Individuals who fixate longer on a single point may require more time to pick up visual information or may struggle with transitioning between relevant cues in their environment. Similarly, the positive relationship between saccade duration and slower performance may indicate that prolonged saccades during free viewing result in less efficient scanning patterns, potentially delaying the processing of critical visual information during movement. Furthermore, the association between intrusive saccades during fixation stability and poorer sport performance may reflect the role of fixation control in visually guided tasks. More intrusive saccades may reflect difficulties in maintaining stable fixation, which could lead to inefficient visual processing during sport-related activities. Similarly, the significant negative association between scan path length during visual search and performance suggests that longer search paths may reflect an inefficient or exhaustive search strategy, possibly due to visual field loss or difficulties in detecting relevant cues efficiently. These findings are consistent with the idea that eye movement characteristics provide valuable functional insights beyond traditional clinical measures. They suggest that inefficiencies in visual scanning, fixation control, and visual search strategies may contribute to an aspect of real-world performance, making eye tracking a promising tool for assessing visual function in individuals with VI. Future research should further explore these relationships across different daily activities to enhance our understanding of the role of eye movements in functional vision.</p><p>Our results offer promise for the use of eye tracking for the classification of Para athletes with VI. During classification, athletes should be placed into classes to compete against others whose impairment has a comparable level of impact on performance. Therefore, an important step in the classification process is to understand the relationship between impairment and performance in that sport (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Mann &amp; Ravensbergen, 2018</xref>). Tests have been conducted to examine the relationship between vision impairment and performance using a range of tests of visual function: visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, motion perception, depth perception, and visual field (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fortin-Guichard et&#160;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Krabben, Ravensbergen, et&#160;al., 2021</xref>). Yet up to now, the lack of a suitable test has prevented an examination of the association between eye movements and sport performance. In this study, we used regression modeling to show that there may be a relationship between performance in sport (i.e., running and swimming) and measures of eye movements. Specifically, the features included in the predictive model reflected the scanning efficiency of the participants during free viewing and visual search, as well as the ability to maintain fixation on a target. Considering the visual demands of VI track athletics and VI swimming, this result could indicate that the efficiency to navigate the complex sporting environment is crucial for optimal performance. For example, experts in the field of VI swimming reached consensus that the ability to swim in a straight line, monitoring the position of competitors, and deciding when to initiate the turn are the components of swimming performance that are most likely affected by VI (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Ravensbergen, Genee, &amp; Mann, 2018</xref>). To achieve these components, an athlete needs to scan the swimming pool to locate and fixate both the T-shaped marker that indicates the middle and end of the lane, as well as the competitors in the other lanes. Similarly, runners benefit from visual cues to remain in their lane and adjust to competitors (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Allen et&#160;al., 2020</xref>). Empirical studies in VI track athletics (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Zenk et&#160;al., 2025</xref>) and VI swimming (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fortin-Guichard et&#160;al., 2022</xref>) also confirm that athletes with no remaining vision are at a performance disadvantage compared to those with residual vision, underscoring the functional importance of vision in these sports.</p><p>The ability to navigate complex sport environments might not be fully captured by traditional measures such as VA and VF. <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fortin-Guichard et al. (2022)</xref> showed that among multiple tests of visual function&#8212;including, among others, contrast sensitivity, depth perception, and motion perception but not eye movements&#8212;VA was the best predictor of swimming performance. However, for the subset of athletes in our study, we show that the prediction of sport performance was superior when taking together the eye-tracking variables <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> VA. Taken together, with our established relationship based on eye movements, we provide the tools for the addition of a new assessment method for visual capabilities with transformative potential for the classification of athletes with VI. Future research with more participants and more sport-specific performance outcomes other than race times could further validate the relationship.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-5"><title>Group-specific eye movement patterns</title><p>In this study, we evaluate the functional consequences of different types of impairment on eye movements. Compared to healthy participants, individuals with combined central and peripheral vision loss were especially different in their fixation characteristics. For example, these individuals produced longer fixation durations during visual search. This is in line with a previous study where the number of fixations and search times during visual search increased with increasing field loss in individuals with retinitis pigmentosa (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Coeckelbergh, Cornelissen, Brouwer, &amp; Kooijman, 2002</xref>). On the contrary, individuals with central vision loss relied more on their peripheral vision. These individuals shifted their gaze less compared to healthy control participants, as evident by, for example, the smaller scan paths and fewer saccades with smaller amplitudes during visual search. This aligns with previous results in individuals with macular degeneration and amblyopia, where it was found that search performance decreased with worse visual acuity and lesion size (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chen, Otero-Millan, Kumar, Shaikh, &amp; Ghasia, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Taylor, Smith, &amp; Crabb, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Thibaut, Boucart, &amp; Tran, 2020</xref>). The decreased search performance was associated with a reduction in the number of saccades compared to healthy controls during the search tasks (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#160;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et&#160;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Thibaut et&#160;al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The participants with central vision loss in our study also used saccades during the saccade test that were smaller in amplitude compared to the healthy controls, suggesting a deficiency in their ability to make accurate and sufficiently large eye movements to new targets. These hypometric saccades have also been shown previously in individuals with Stargardt disease (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Giacomelli et&#160;al., 2021</xref>). Another explanation could be that those with moderate central vision loss can use multiple (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Crossland et&#160;al., 2004</xref>) or any part of the peripheral field to perceive the contents on the screen. As Participant 6 (Stargardt disease), who barely made any eye movements during testing, voluntarily verbally reported, &#8220;It does not matter where the stimuli appear, my vision is poor across my whole visual field, so I just don't move my eyes and use the parts where the stimuli land.&#8221; This adaptation has been observed before in <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Nieboer, Svensen, van Paridon, Van Biesen, and Mann (2025)</xref>, where a tennis player with no central vision did not make any eye movements when returning a tennis serve but still managed to return almost all 40 balls (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Nieboer et&#160;al., 2025</xref>). Lastly, compared to healthy control participants, both the participants with combined central and peripheral vision loss and participants with central vision loss demonstrated impaired fixation stability with an increased number of intrusive saccades. This finding is not surprising given the well-documented deficiency in individuals with central vision loss (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bellmann et&#160;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bethlehem et&#160;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Crossland et&#160;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kumar &amp; Chung, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Macedo, Crossland, &amp; Rubin, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Tarita-Nistor et&#160;al., 2017</xref>). Our research provides a foundation for better understanding how distinct types of vision loss impact functional vision. By identifying these distinctive eye movement characteristics, our study supports the potential for using eye tracking for clinical purposes.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-6"><title>Peripheral vision loss and clustering</title><p>Perhaps surprisingly, the clustering model did not form a distinct group for individuals with only peripheral vision loss. One possible explanation is that the eye movements of these individuals may be relatively similar to those with normal vision, particularly in tasks that rely heavily on central vision (e.g., fixation stability, smooth pursuit). Because the model grouped participants based solely on their eye movement data&#8212;without knowledge of their clinical diagnosis or visual field results&#8212;this overlap suggests that intact central vision may be sufficient to maintain near-typical oculomotor behavior in some tasks. However, we did observe, on an individual level, differences in eye movements between those with peripheral vision loss and healthy controls, especially for the visual search and saccade tasks. These findings highlight that while clustering based on eye movement features offers promise, more targeted analyses may be required to fully distinguish between peripheral vision loss and normal vision in applied settings. Alternatively, with only four participants in our cohort with pure peripheral vision loss, we may have lacked sufficient data to detect subtle differences in eye movements between this group and the healthy control participants or others with VI. As we hypothesized, we would expect to find altered eye movements on, for example, the test of saccades and visual search in individuals with peripheral vision loss. A larger sample of individuals with peripheral vision loss could provide further insights and potentially reveal an additional subgroup within the cohort of individuals with VI.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-7"><title>Relevance of individual tests in the battery</title><p>Not all tests included in the test battery were as relevant as others for the assessment of visual capabilities among athletes with VI. Principal component analysis on the 40 variables derived from the five different tests of eye movements revealed four principal components, retaining 19 variables. Four of five tests appeared to be most relevant. Free viewing variables were represented in all four principal components, with the first component consisting exclusively of free viewing variables. All fixation stability variables were featured in the second principal component, while half of the saccade and visual search variables were represented in the final two components. Only 1 of the 19 variables featured in the four principal components was obtained from the test of smooth pursuit. This variable, the average number of saccades during smooth pursuit trials, did not yield any significant differences between clusters, indicating that it did not contribute much to cluster formation and, therefore, may be less critical for discriminating visual function in this population. This result is somewhat surprising given that anomalies in smooth pursuit are established as a reliable biomarker of neurological disorders (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Harezlak &amp; Kasprowski, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hunt, Mah, Reed, Engel, &amp; Keightley, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Papagiannopoulou, Chitty, Hermens, Hickie, &amp; Lagopoulos, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Tao et&#160;al., n.d.</xref>). A key limitation of our smooth pursuit task was its potential predictability. The target always moved along a fixed trajectory, starting from one of four predetermined locations and passing through the center. This design may have encouraged anticipatory strategies. Additionally, the fixed trial duration may have further facilitated prediction, potentially influencing pursuit performance. Future studies should consider incorporating more randomized trajectories, variable target timing, or a less predictable motion pattern to better isolate smooth pursuit ability. The remaining tests had greater contributions in explaining the variance in the eye movement data. By focusing on the tests that provide the most relevant measures of visual capabilities, it may be possible to streamline the assessment protocol, making it more efficient and targeted.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-8"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>While our study provides promising evidence for the utility of eye tracking in assessing visual capabilities among individuals with VI, a few limitations should be noted. One potential limitation is that we used an eye tracker (i.e., the Pupil Invisible), which is less accurate than a research-grade eye-tracking system. As a result, the precision of our measurements of gaze (e.g., fixation stability) may provide an underrepresentation of any actual differences between individuals or groups. Despite that, even our test of fixation stability still showed differences between clusters: The group with healthy central vision (Cluster 1) showed less fixation dispersion than the two clusters composed entirely of individuals with vision impairment (Cluster 2 and Cluster 3; both <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001). Importantly, Cluster 2, which had the poorest fixation stability on average (i.e., significantly worse than for Cluster 3), included 10 participants with nystagmus&#8212;accounting for 67% of all nystagmus cases in our cohort. This aligns well with the known oculomotor profile of individuals with nystagmus, who typically exhibit unstable fixation and involuntary eye movements. These results help to validate our approach.</p><p>Furthermore, we applied analytical methods, such as PCA and machine learning, that are generally more reliable with larger sample sizes. With a sample of 46 athletes with VI, there is a risk of overfitting in our regression analyses, particularly given the number of predictors included. Future studies with larger data sets should aim to validate this model. While our sample size provided valuable initial insights, future studies with larger cohorts are essential to confirm these patterns, ensuring the representativeness and generalizability of these findings. Future studies could also explore the applicability of eye tracking across different sports to refine its use in performance prediction and classification.</p><p>While our study focused on core eye movement functions such as fixation stability, smooth pursuit, and saccades, other oculomotor mechanisms, such as vergence and the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), may also play a role in sports performance. Vergence eye movements contribute to depth perception and binocular coordination, which are particularly critical for sports requiring spatial awareness, such as ball sports or combat sports (<xref rid="bib11a" ref-type="bibr">Erickson, 2021</xref>). Research suggests that conjugate and disjunctive eye movements may play a role in sport performance (<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Zwierko et&#160;al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, the VOR is essential for stabilizing gaze during rapid head movements, which may be crucial in dynamic sports where athletes need to track objects or opponents while in motion (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brown, Leung, Evans, Grant, &amp; Hides, 2022</xref>). Investigating additional eye movement variables and integrating eye tracking with other assessment tools could further enhance our understanding of visual function and its relation to sport performance in athletes with VI.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that we were unable to reliably estimate pursuit latency across all participants in the smooth pursuit paradigm. Delays in pursuit initiation can artificially lower gain estimates, making it unclear whether low gain reflects a true oculomotor deficit or simply a delayed response. Latency detection was especially challenging in our cohort due to the presence of nystagmus and other oculomotor irregularities (see&#160;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>), which were not present in prior studies (e.g., <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Shanidze et&#160;al., 2017</xref>). The smooth pursuit findings should therefore be interpreted with this limitation in mind.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, our study provides evidence supporting the feasibility and validity of eye tracking as a robust tool for assessing eye movement patterns associated with VI. The newly developed test battery of eye movements was deemed feasible, with 38 out of the 43 participants with vision impairment successfully completing the full test, despite having a wide range of ocular conditions and impairment severities. The test battery, developed to measure the functional consequences of VI, was sensitive to differences in the type of impairment supporting the construct validity of the tests. Furthermore, predictive validity was evidenced by good predictions of sport performance based on eye tracking and visual acuity features together. Future research should focus on further verifying the construct validity by determining to what degree the results for predictive validity generalize to activities of daily living. Overall, our findings suggests that eye tracking can provide a feasible and valid tool to measure the functional consequences of VI that extends beyond traditional methods and that eye-tracking variables can help predict how athletes with VI perform on sporting tasks such as running and swimming.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="jovi-25-11-5_s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplement 1</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="jovi-25-11-5_s001.docx" id="d67e2001" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge the use of OpenAI's ChatGPT (Version GPT-4, released by OpenAI) in reviewing the data analysis process.
