Global statistics paint a stark picture of diarrheal disease impact on young children. Annually, an estimated 1.7 billion diarrheal episodes occur in this age group, resulting in 123 million clinic visits and 9 million hospitalizations worldwide. The burden of these illnesses translates to a loss of 62 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). In India specifically, the situation is particularly grave, with acute diarrheal disease (ADD) responsible for approximately 10% of all deaths among children U-5 years old.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Contaminated food and water sources are the main reasons behind diarrheal diseases, which remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children worldwide.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] A staggering number of people globally face water and sanitation challenges: 780 million individuals do not have access to clean drinking water, and 2.5 billion lack proper sanitation facilities.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Infection-induced diarrhea is pervasive throughout developing nations. In low-income nations, children U-3 years of age typically endure an average of three diarrheal episodes annually. Each occurrence robs the child of vital nutrients essential for growth. A destructive feedback loop exists: Diarrhea significantly contributes to malnutrition, while children suffering from malnutrition are more vulnerable to diarrheal diseases.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Malnutrition and diarrhea form a dangerous cycle in young children. Malnourished children are more susceptible to diarrheal diseases, and each bout of diarrhea further worsens their nutritional status. As a result, diarrhea is a primary contributor to malnutrition among children under 5 years of age.[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The prevalence of ADD ranged from 22% to 26.4%, which was reported by various studies conducted in different parts of the country.[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] No such study has been conducted in recent past in our region; therefore, we planned to conduct this study to assess the prevalence of ADD among U-5 children in the past 3 months and to determine the various factor associated with them.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The present study is a cross-sectional study conducted for a period of 1 year (01 / 01/2023 to 31 / 12/2023). The Rural Field Practice area of GMC, Amritsar, comprises three villages, namely, Nag Kalan (population =6106), Nangal Pannuan (population =2040), and Nag Nawain (population =1565). For selection of three slums in the urban area, a list of slums both registered and unregistered ones, was procured from the Civil Surgeon office and selection was made by the lottery method. The sequence of the study was from the largest to the smallest of the three villages and three slums.</p><sec><title>Sample size and sampling technique</title><p>The sample size was calculated using the formula for a single proportion N &gt; Z2 x P x Q/D2, considering a 95% confidence interval, a 4.9% prevalence of ADD,[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and 0.05 precision, resulting in an initial size of 71. Therefore, a total of overall 426 study participants formulated the sample size where equal numbers of study participants were included from all the six selected areas, that is, 71 each from three villages and 71 each from three selected urban slums (71 &#215; 6 = 426). There was one child aged 1&#8211;5 years (the youngest if the family has a higher number of such children) from every second house with at least one eligible child in all the three villages of the rural field practice area of GMC, Amritsar, and three selected urban slums of Amritsar city. A sample of 430 children, 215 each in rural&#8211;urban areas was drawn (four study participants, two each from the largest slum and village were included to get an even distribution of 215 each instead of 213).</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection tool</title><p>Prior information to the either of the parents of the child was given, and the purpose of the study was explained to them accordingly. One-to-one interview with parents/informant was held by the author for recording the information as per predesigned, prestructured, and pretested proforma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p>Besides approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee, permission from Civil Surgeon Amritsar was also sought after explaining the purpose of study in depth. The rural part of the study was conducted in the descending order of population at all the three villages falling under the rural field practice area of GMC, Amritsar, while the urban component was conducted in the selected three urban slums arranged in descending order of population of the city. For selection of three slums in the urban area, the list of slums, both registered and unregistered ones, was procured from the Civil Surgeon office and selection was made by the lottery method. The sequence of the study was from the largest to the smallest of the three villages/selected slums. In case, the child of the selected house was suffering from some chronic disease or congenital anomaly or some serious illness or was not available even on the third consecutive visit or the parents did not give the written informed consent, the child from the next house was taken for the study. In case, the family had more than one eligible child, the youngest was selected for the study. Two visits were made per week, and 7&#8211;10 children were studied during each visit. The study continued till the required number of children, that is, 215 from rural and urban areas each, were studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Operational definition</title><sec><title>Measurement of weight</title><p>The weight of the child in the minimal light clothing was recorded accurately on an electronic-type weighing machine. The weighing scale with a minimum unit of 100 g was used, and it was checked and corrected before every use. The weight of every child was measured thrice, and the mean of the three readings was taken as the weight of the child and recorded on the proforma.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of height</title><p>The height of the children was measured in erect posture by making the child with bare feet to stand on an even ground near a wall with the back of the heels, buttocks, shoulders, and occiput of the child touching the wall. A hard board or scale was placed on the head of the child, and the wall was marked at the level of the scale or board with a soft pencil.</p><p>The distance between the ground and the mark on the wall was taken as the height of the child and recorded on the proforma.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of MUAC</title><p>For measurement of MUAC, Shakir tape was used. Measurement was performed on the left arm or nondominating arm, midway between the acromion and the olecranon. The tape was held gently without pressing the soft tissues. The tape was flexible and nonstretchable and unaffected by temperatures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Compilation was done using Microsoft Excel, and analysis was done using Epi-info 0.7 (CDC USA).

Urban participants experienced a higher prevalence (35%) compared to rural participants (11%). According to NFHS-5, the overall prevalence of acute diarrheal diseases was 4.9% and the prevalence of acute diarrheal diseases was relatively higher in the urban population (6%) compared to the rural population (4.3%).[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In contrast, a study by Ilukor Geresom <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (2019) reported that the prevalence of diarrheal diseases was relatively higher among the rural population (59.8%) compared to urban (42.6%), but in our study, the variation could be attributed to the fact that the urban study participants were from urban slums, which have inadequate infrastructure and poor water and sanitation facilities. According to a study conducted by Koustav Ghosh <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] the national prevalence of diarrhea was 9.2%. Another study by Pintu Paul found that in India, about 9% of under-5 children experienced diarrheal disease.[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A study conducted by Sudipta Basa suggested that the prevalence of diarrhea was 14.8% among U-5 children in urban slums of Delhi.[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>A significant difference in diarrheal occurrences between younger and older children was found. A higher proportion (32%) of children aged 12&#8211;24 months experienced diarrheal episodes in the past 3 months compared to only 18% in the 49&#8211;60-month age group. Possible reasons for this age-related disparity include developing immune systems in younger children and increased exposure to pathogens as toddlers become more mobile and explore their environment.</p><p>The prevalence of ADD was significantly higher among children whose mothers were illiterate (36%) compared to those with literate mothers (17%). Children of housewives had a higher prevalence of ADD (24%) compared to those of working mothers (17%). In some cases, housewives might not adhere to stringent hygiene practices as strictly as necessary, particularly if they are managing multiple household tasks simultaneously.</p><p>Interestingly, the data show that diarrhea prevalence decreases as the socioeconomic status decreases, with the highest rate (43%) observed in the upper class and the lowest rate (18%) in the lower class. Upper-class families might be more likely to recognize and report diarrheal episodes.</p><p>Surprisingly, children taking &#8805;3 meals per day showed a higher ADD prevalence (25%) compared to those taking &#8804;2 meals (19%). This finding suggests that other factors such as food quality or hygiene might play more significant roles. Surprisingly, fast food consumption was associated with a lower ADD prevalence (15%) compared to those who did not consume fast food (24%). It could be related to confounding factors such as socioeconomic status, food handling practices, or differences in reporting.</p><sec><title>ADD with immunization status</title><p>39% of children with incomplete immunization experienced at least one episode of diarrhea in the past 3 months. In contrast, only 22% of fully immunized children reported diarrheal episodes. The statistical significance of this difference strongly suggests that complete immunization is associated with a reduced risk of diarrheal disease in this population.</p><p>Participants residing in a pucca house had a slightly higher prevalence of ADD (24%) compared to those in a kaccha house (20%). Pucca houses might have less natural ventilation, potentially creating a more humid environment that favors pathogen growth. Interestingly, those with tap water supply reported 25% prevalence of ADD, compared to 17% among those with other water sources. Access to tap water might correlate with other factors influencing ADD risk. The prevalence of ADD was higher among participants without pets or cattle (24%). Pet ownership might correlate with other factors influencing ADD risk, such as access to healthcare or better nutrition and hygiene practices.</p><p>The prevalence of ADD was slightly higher among children who were stunted (25%), were underweight (24%), and had a mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) less than 12.5 cm (24%). In comparison, the prevalence of ADD among children with normal height-for-age (22%), weight-for-age (23%), and MUAC greater than 12.5 cm (23%) was slightly lower. However, these differences were not statistically significant. This suggests that there may be a trend toward higher ADD prevalence in children with poorer nutritional status. A study conducted among U-5 children showed an overall prevalence of diarrhea of 5.5% and a high prevalence of diarrhea (41%) in children who had acute malnutrition (wasting).[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>ADD remains a significant health concern, with a higher prevalence in urban areas (35%) compared to rural areas (11%). Factors contributing to the occurrence of ADD include the age of the children, maternal education, fast food consumption, immunization status, and water storage practices. Conduct community-based educational programs for mothers focusing on hygiene, sanitation, nutrition, and early management of diarrhea. Implement outreach vaccination programs in both rural and urban areas to improve access and coverage.</p><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="book" publication-format="print"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Registrar General of India</collab></person-group><article-title>Sample Registration System Statistical Report 2021</article-title><publisher-loc>New Delhi</publisher-loc><source>Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India</source><year>2022</year><comment>Available from: <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://censusindia.gov.in">https://censusindia.gov.in</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="book" publication-format="print"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Park</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acute diarrhoeal diseases</article-title><source>Park&#8217;s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine</source><edition>26th</edition><publisher-name>M/s Banarsidas Bhanot</publisher-name><year>2021</year><fpage>258</fpage><lpage>66</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="R3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="book" publication-format="print"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF)</collab></person-group><article-title>Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines</article-title><publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc><publisher-name>WHO and UNICEF</publisher-name><year>2017</year><comment>Available from: <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.who.int">https://www.who.int</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="R4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="book" publication-format="print"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>World Health Organization</collab></person-group><article-title>Diarrhoeal Disease</article-title><publisher-loc>Genava</publisher-loc><publisher-name>World Health Organization</publisher-name><year>2024</year><comment>Available from: <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diarrhoeal-disease">https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diarrhoeal-disease</uri>.
