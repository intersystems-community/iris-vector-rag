In 2022, an estimated 1.46 million new cases and over 396&#160;000 deaths were reported globally<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Although localized PCa has an excellent prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%, this rate drops dramatically to 29% in cases of distant metastasis. However, PCa often has an insidious onset with no noticeable symptoms in the early stages. This poses a significant challenge for early detection, particularly in countries without routine PCa screening programs, where many patients are diagnosed at advanced stages.<boxed-text id="UBT0001" position="float" orientation="portrait"><sec><title>HIGHLIGHTS</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Identification of predictive plasma biomarkers: Analysis of 1463 plasma proteins in 23&#160;825 men from the UK Biobank identified TSPAN1 and GP2 as top predictors of PCa, with hazard ratios of 1.73 and 1.65, respectively.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Efficient machine learning&#8211;based model: A two-protein panel (TSPAN1&#160;+&#160;GP2), when combined with demographic variables, achieved an AUC of 0.728 in PCa prediction, comparable to larger multi-protein models but with greater clinical simplicity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Temporal dynamics of biomarkers: TSPAN1 levels began rising approximately 9&#160;years before diagnosis, while GP2 showed a delayed yet sustained elevation starting from 6&#160;years prior, suggesting a sequential biomarker pattern.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Minimally invasive clinical utility: The validated protein panel enables blood-based early risk stratification and could help reduce reliance on invasive procedures in prostate cancer screening.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></boxed-text></p><p>Currently, the most commonly used method for PCa screening is the detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in blood.

For the present study, we included 23&#160;825 adult men who had baseline plasma proteomic profiles and no prior history of PCa at enrollment (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

</p><p>The study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of baseline plasma proteins for incident prostate cancer using both conventional Cox regression and machine learning&#8211;based approaches. Model performance was assessed using internal cross-validation and stratified testing sets. All analyses were conducted in accordance with the UKB research ethics framework. This work has been reported in line with the STROCSS criteria<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition of outcome variables</title><p>The primary outcome was the diagnosis of PCa, determined by clinical examination and pathological evaluation conducted by clinicians and pathologists within the cohort. Alternatively, diagnoses were identified through linkage to hospital records, cancer registries, and death registries in the UKB using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10: C62). The enrollment date in the UKB was considered the start of the follow-up period. Follow-up continued until the first occurrence of PCa diagnosis, death, loss to follow-up, or the end of available registry data (15 January 2024), whichever came first.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasma proteomics</title><p>The plasma proteomics workflow in the UKB, including sampling, storage, and sequencing, has been previously described<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. In brief, baseline blood samples were collected from 2007 to 2010 at 22 UK assessment centers. Most were obtained during participants&#8217; baseline visits, with additional samples sourced from the UKB Pharma Plasma Proteome Consortium and the COVID-19 repeat imaging study. Blood was drawn into EDTA tubes, centrifuged at 2500&#160;g for 10&#160;minutes at 4&#176;C to isolate plasma, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C for further analysis.</p><p>Samples were shipped on dry ice to the Olink analysis service center in Sweden, where protein quantification was performed using the antibody-based Olink Explore Proximity Extension Assay<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. Plasma proteomic analysis covered 52&#160;704 UKB participants between April 2021 and February 2022. Laboratory personnel were blinded to all sample characteristics and clinical data. Detailed protocols for sample handling and storage have been reported previously<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. After stringent quality control, 1463 unique proteins were quantified, spanning cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory, neurological, and oncological pathways. Intra- and inter-plate coefficients of variation for all Olink panels were below 10% and 20%, respectively. Protein levels were expressed as normalized protein expression (NPX) values, derived by dividing sample-specific counts by standardized counts (see Olink normalization documentation: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/ukb/docs/Olink_1536_B0_to_B7_Normalization.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/ukb/docs/Olink_1536_B0_to_B7_Normalization.pdf</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical methods and analytical framework</title><p>No formal statistical power calculation was conducted prior to analysis. However, the study included 23&#160;825 men, among whom 1234 developed incident prostate cancer over a median follow-up of 14.7&#160;years. This large sample size enabled stable estimation of effect sizes and model performance metrics, particularly in internal validation analyses. Descriptive statistics were used to compare differences between the PCa event group and controls, employing chi-square tests for categorical variables and Student&#8217;s t-tests for continuous variables.</p><p>Cox proportional hazards regression Models were applied to estimate the association between each plasma protein&#8217;s scaled NPX value and PCa events.

To prioritize features, we ranked these proteins by their importance scores based on information gain. Proteins were then sequentially added to the model using a forward selection strategy, where one additional protein was incorporated at each step based on the ranking.</p><p>At each step, 10-fold cross-validation was conducted within the training set to compute the mean AUC and its standard deviation. The forward selection process was terminated when the incremental improvement in mean AUC was less than 0.005 for two consecutive steps. This conservative stopping criterion was adopted to minimize overfitting and to ensure that only proteins providing stable and meaningful contributions to predictive performance were retained.</p><p>To optimize model performance, key LightGBM hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of leaves, maximum depth, and feature fraction) were tuned using grid search within the training set. The configuration yielding the highest mean AUC in cross-validation was selected. To address class imbalance (approximate PCa incidence of 5.2%), the scale_pos_weight parameter in LightGBM was set according to the inverse class ratio in the training set.</p><p>To further interpret model behavior, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were calculated for the final model. These values quantified the marginal contribution of each protein to the predicted PCa risk for individual participants and indicated whether higher protein expression was associated with increased or decreased risk according to the model.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of predictive accuracy</title><p>Model performance was evaluated in the independent validation set using predicted probabilities generated by LightGBM models trained on the training set. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted, and area under the curve (AUC) values with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using DeLong&#8217;s method.</p><p>We compared predictive performance across multiple models: (i) individual top-ranked proteins; (ii) small protein panels derived from LightGBM-based stepwise selection; and (iii) extended models integrating protein panels with demographic covariates including age, BMI, ethnicity, TDI, family history of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and HDL cholesterol. Logistic regression was used for visualization only and did not influence model training.</p><p>To assess temporal robustness, time-stratified models were constructed for PCa events occurring within 5&#160;years, within 10&#160;years, and beyond 10&#160;years from baseline. For each timeframe, the outcome was redefined accordingly, and controls were limited to participants free of PCa at the corresponding follow-up time. To minimize reverse causality, individuals diagnosed with PCa within 1 year of enrollment were excluded from all prediction analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Survival and temporal trajectory analyses</title><p>Kaplan&#8211;Meier curves were generated to examine PCa incidence by dichotomized protein levels using optimal Youden index cutoffs. Cox regression estimated hazard ratios for high vs. low expression groups. For longitudinal profiling, we analyzed protein trajectories across 14&#160;years preceding PCa diagnosis in cases. For controls (i.e., participants free of PCa until censoring), mean protein levels across the entire cohort were used as a stable reference. Yearly mean values were calculated and visualized. Group differences were tested annually using t-tests, and overall trends were examined using Mann&#8211;Kendall tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Software and statistical significance</title><p>All data analyses were conducted using R (v4.3.3) and Jupyter Notebook (v7.2.2).

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we systematically identified plasma proteins associated with incident PCa using a large-scale, high-throughput proteomics platform in a prospective population-based cohort. Among the 1463 proteins examined, TSPAN1 and GP2 consistently emerged as the most robust and informative biomarkers across all analyses &#8211; including Cox regression, LightGBM importance ranking, SHAP value attribution, and validation AUCs &#8211; for predicting PCa risk within 5&#160;years, 10&#160;years, beyond 10&#160;years, and across all events.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study utilizing UK Biobank&#8217;s proteomics resource to establish a plasma protein-based predictive model for PCa. Although multiple proteins showed nominal associations with PCa risk in multivariable Cox models, only TSPAN1 and GP2 retained statistical significance after stringent Bonferroni correction. These two proteins alone yielded a validation AUC of 0.671, which improved to 0.728 with the addition of demographic covariates. The best-performing model, incorporating TSPAN1, GP2, CCL18, and demographics, reached an AUC of 0.767 for 5-year prediction, supporting their potential clinical utility.</p><p>Kaplan&#8211;Meier analysis confirmed the prognostic relevance of TSPAN1 and GP2, with high-expression groups exhibiting significantly increased PCa risk (HRs of 1.75 and 1.60, respectively). Furthermore, temporal trajectory analyses revealed that TSPAN1 levels began diverging from controls up to 9&#160;years before diagnosis, while GP2 exhibited a delayed yet persistent increase from 6&#160;years prior. These trends suggest that both proteins may reflect early pathophysiologic alterations and hold promise as preclinical biomarkers.</p><p>TSPAN1 is a member of the tetraspanin family involved in cell-cell adhesion, signal transduction, and membrane protein trafficking<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. While its role in PCa is still under investigation, emerging evidence suggests it is regulated by androgen signaling and contributes to disease progression. A prior study demonstrated that TSPAN1 expression is upregulated in PCa cells under androgen stimulation and promotes the expression of <italic toggle="yes">Slug</italic>, a transcription factor implicated in epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process in cancer invasion and metastasis<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, TSPAN1 has been identified as a marker of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and was associated with reduced biochemical recurrence-free survival in PCa patients, suggesting a potential role in stromal&#8211;epithelial crosstalk and tumor progression<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. However, the precise mechanisms by which TSPAN1 contributes to PCa pathogenesis remain unclear, particularly in the context of circulating protein dynamics. Our study expands current understanding by demonstrating that plasma levels of TSPAN1 begin to rise approximately 9 years prior to clinical diagnosis, potentially reflecting subclinical tumor activity and shedding into the circulation. This temporal pattern supports its utility as an early, non-invasive biomarker, with potential relevance for both screening and risk stratification.</p><p>GP2, a glycoprotein primarily known for its expression in pancreatic acinar cells and involvement in mucosal immunity via its zona pellucida-like domain<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>, has only recently been explored in the context of PCa. Although studies remain limited, immunohistochemical data suggest that elevated GP2 expression correlates with adverse histological features such as higher Gleason score and lymph node involvement, and may be associated with tumor heterogeneity<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. In our analysis, plasma GP2 levels were significantly elevated in future PCa cases and showed a sustained increase starting approximately 6 years before diagnosis. This pattern suggests a potential role for GP2 in early carcinogenesis, possibly through modulation of immune surveillance or epithelial barrier integrity. The consistent upregulation of GP2 in both tissue and plasma supports its candidacy as a circulating biomarker, though mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate its biological function in the prostate tumor microenvironment.</p><p>Importantly, our data demonstrate that the majority of predictive signal resides in a narrow subset of proteins &#8211; namely TSPAN1 and GP2 &#8211; rather than in large multiplex panels. Although the combination of TSPAN1, GP2, and CCL18 with demographics yielded the highest AUC (0.767) for 5-year prediction, this gain over the TSPAN1&#160;+&#160;GP2&#160;+&#160;demographic model (0.760) was marginal. For long-term risk prediction across the entire follow-up, TSPAN1 and GP2 consistently outperformed larger panels. Adding more proteins beyond these core markers contributed little to predictive performance and occasionally introduced overfitting, highlighting the value of a parsimonious and robust biomarker signature.</p><p>Analyzing protein concentration trajectories over the 14&#160;years preceding diagnosis revealed that TSPAN1 levels began to rise significantly 9&#160;years before PCa diagnosis. GP2, in contrast, showed significant separation from the normal group&#8217;s concentration curve starting 6&#160;years before diagnosis, making it another key predictive molecule for PCa. Integrating demographic features and other relevant factors is essential to develop a non-invasive, cost-effective, and accessible prediction algorithm for accurately assessing PCa risk. In addition to the protein panel, we incorporated demographic factors such as age, BMI, and TDI, which significantly improved the model&#8217;s predictive performance. The results indicate that the combination of plasma proteins and demographic features performs best in predicting PCa risk within 5&#160;years, with robust accuracy for predictions within 10&#160;years. However, the model&#8217;s performance for PCa risk beyond 10&#160;years was less effective.</p><p>While PSA remains the current screening standard<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>, it was unavailable in the UK Biobank, limiting direct comparison. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the protein-based model could aid early risk stratification, particularly among older men with low-risk proteomic profiles who might benefit from reduced screening frequency. Future studies should evaluate whether such protein-based stratification can complement or refine PSA-based protocols in clinical practice. Moreover, decision curve analysis and net reclassification improvement could not be conducted due to the absence of PSA and biopsy data, but future validations in independent cohorts with comprehensive clinical outcomes will be critical to defining actionable thresholds and assessing real-world decision utility.</p><p>Beyond diagnostic accuracy, our findings contribute to the broader understanding of PCa pathogenesis. The distinct temporal dynamics of TSPAN1 and GP2 point to heterogeneous molecular processes underpinning disease initiation. TSPAN1 may reflect early tumor microenvironment remodeling, while GP2 could be linked to later-stage immune escape or systemic dissemination. Further mechanistic studies &#8211; integrating transcriptomics, immune profiling, and spatial omics &#8211; are needed to contextualize their roles within gene&#8211;environment interactions and tissue-specific pathways.</p><p>Translationally, the non-invasive nature and high-throughput compatibility of plasma proteomics position TSPAN1 and GP2 as practical candidates for integration into primary care or risk-adapted PCa screening strategies. While PSA testing remains the current standard, its limited specificity often results in unnecessary imaging and biopsy procedures. A parsimonious plasma protein panel could complement existing pathways by improving risk stratification &#8211; either as a pre-PSA screening tool or to refine decision-making among individuals with borderline PSA values. This approach may help optimize downstream use of multiparametric MRI and biopsy, ultimately enhancing diagnostic precision and reducing overtreatment. Moreover, the Olink platform used in this study is compatible with large-scale clinical deployment, and the addition of two plasma biomarkers would entail minimal cost and logistical burden. Future efforts should focus on external validation, harmonization across proteomic platforms, and integration into prospective clinical trials to evaluate feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and clinical utility in real-world settings. Combining TSPAN1 and GP2 with PSA or imaging may ultimately enable multi-modal early detection strategies with improved accuracy and tailored patient management.</p><p>This study has several notable strengths, including the use of large-scale high-throughput proteomics sequencing and a large cohort with long-term follow-up. These features greatly enhance the reliability of our findings and facilitate the identification of previously unreported plasma protein biomarkers.</p><p>However, several limitations should also be acknowledged. First, PSA levels were not available in the UK Biobank, limiting direct comparison with current clinical standards. Second, detailed clinical information such as tumor stage, Gleason grade, and molecular subtypes was not accessible, preventing us from evaluating whether TSPAN1 or GP2 levels correlate with disease aggressiveness or progression. Third, plasma protein levels were measured only once at baseline, so temporal trajectories were inferred from cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data. As a result, our findings reflect population-level rather than within-individual dynamics. Fourth, external validation was not feasible due to the lack of large, independent proteomics cohorts. Although temporally split training-validation and cross-validation strategies were applied to enhance model robustness, platform-specific variability may limit the generalizability of absolute protein thresholds. This underscores the need for future multicenter replication. Fifth, the timing of PCa diagnosis may not perfectly coincide with the actual onset of disease, introducing potential misclassification in trajectory analyses. Sixth, the UK Biobank cohort is predominantly composed of White, UK-based individuals and lacks diversity in ancestry and clinical annotations, which may constrain broader applicability and mechanistic interpretation of the findings. Moreover, the absence of detailed histological or molecular subtyping data prevented us from examining subtype-specific associations, highlighting directions for future mechanistic and stratified research. Finally, although our proteomics-based approach identified key candidate biomarkers, their roles within gene&#8211;environment interaction frameworks remain poorly understood.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our findings underscore the promise of plasma proteomics in advancing early detection and risk stratification for PCa. TSPAN1 and GP2 represent robust, biologically plausible, and temporally informative biomarkers that merit further investigation for integration into future screening algorithms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Leveraging large-scale plasma proteomics and long-term follow-up from a population-based cohort, this study identified TSPAN1 and GP2 as robust predictive biomarkers for future PCa risk. These proteins showed consistent associations with disease onset across multiple analytical approaches and time windows. When combined with basic demographic variables, the resulting model achieved strong predictive performance, including up to 10&#160;years before diagnosis. Incorporating such biomarkers into early risk stratification frameworks may enable more accurate screening and timely intervention for individuals at increased risk of PCa.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Supplemental Digital Content is available for this article.
