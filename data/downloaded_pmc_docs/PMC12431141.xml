Introduction</title><p>In this study, a prototype system of a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), which was originally designed as a low-cost device for the general public as an alternative to lockdown measures [<xref rid="B1-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], was developed by modifying it to include estimation functions for respiratory flow and mask leakage, using a single differential-pressure sensor and a controller (microcontroller board: Arduino UNO R4 WiFi). The wearing status and leak status are displayed in real time on a smartphone application via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication.</p><p>Evaluation using a cylinder&#8211;piston-driven mannequin head confirmed that the disturbance flow (<bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>3e</sub></bold>), estimated solely from the differential pressure <bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold> and battery voltage <bold>V<sub>b</sub></bold>, showed high agreement with the measured value (<bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>3m</sub></bold>). In addition, a method for the automatic judgment of wearing and leakage based on the time-integrated value of <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>3e</sub></bold> was implemented.</p><p>In the future, this system is expected to be applied to societal-level infection control, particularly in extensions such as pressure control to assist breathing activity and health monitoring based on cough and respiratory pattern analysis.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic that began in early 2020 had a serious impact on societies worldwide [<xref rid="B3-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Even in the future, the emergence of variants or novel airborne infectious diseases may cause new pandemics [<xref rid="B5-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. While vaccines and therapeutic agents are available, non-pharmaceutical public health measures (PHSMs) such as physical distancing, mask-wearing, ventilation, event restrictions, travel restrictions, and quarantine have been widely implemented. However, if response measures are delayed, lockdowns may be enforced [<xref rid="B6-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which impose severe social and economic burdens. Therefore, the establishment of a strong and sustainable infection control method as an alternative to lockdown is an urgent challenge.</p><p>Among transmission routes, in addition to contact, oral, and droplet infection, airborne transmission exists. Airborne transmission via aerosols is especially difficult to contain as aerosols can float and diffuse widely in indoor spaces [<xref rid="B8-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is highly likely that airborne transmission will be a major route in the next pandemic. In particular, the dynamics of infection via aerosol particles cannot be accurately represented by conventional SIR models, and more sophisticated modeling is required [<xref rid="B10-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, except for vaccines, there are few effective countermeasures against airborne infection that are accessible to the general public, and even these have limited efficacy [<xref rid="B11-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Medical-grade powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are widely used as protective equipment with high performance against airborne infectious diseases. First, PAPRs are equipped with high-performance nonwoven filters such as HEPA filters. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), HEPA filters guarantee a collection efficiency of 99.97% or higher for the most penetrating particle size (MPPS), typically 0.3 &#181;m [<xref rid="B12-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This means they also perform well in removing both larger and smaller particles than those 0.3 &#181;m in size.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that the MPPS may vary depending on factors such as the filter material, electrostatic charge, and airflow rate; in some cases, MPPS can be as small as 0.1&#8211;0.2 &#181;m for non-electret filters, or even around 40 nm for electret types [<xref rid="B13-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While the MPPS cannot be strictly defined across all scenarios, HEPA filters have long been verified under rigorous standards and consistently demonstrate high performance in practical settings [<xref rid="B12-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, for high-reliability applications such as PAPR, HEPA filters remain an extremely effective protective measure.</p><p>Second, PAPRs maintain a positive-pressure environment inside the hood, which effectively prevents the intrusion of external aerosols. This pressure-based protection is especially prominent in helmet/hood-type PAPRs. According to manufacturer certification based on WPF or SWPF testing, Assigned Protection Factors (APFs) can reach up to 1000 [<xref rid="B14-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which is orders of magnitude higher than those for typical half-mask respirators (APF = 10) or N95 masks (equivalent to APF = 10). In contrast, negative-pressure respirators such as N95 masks may allow inward airflow through face gaps due to the inward negative pressure generated during inhalation. Note that APF is defined by OSHA as the ratio of external to internal concentration: APF = [external concentration]/[internal concentration] [<xref rid="B14-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Third, the use of PAPRs is expected to contribute to reducing infection risk by significantly lowering the number of virus particles inhaled. Although the infectious dose required to cause infection varies depending on the pathogen type, host immunity, and exposure route, it has inherent uncertainty [<xref rid="B16-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, for COVID-19, the analysis of actual superspreader events has estimated that the infectious dose (N<sub>0</sub>) is roughly between 300 and 2000 virus particles [<xref rid="B17-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Under such conditions, the use of PAPRs combining HEPA filtration and the positive-pressure suppression of external air inflow is highly likely to reduce inhaled particles below the infection threshold.</p><p>Therefore, from the standpoint of reducing the probability of infection establishment, PAPR use is expected to significantly contribute to infection risk reduction. The authors have prototyped low-cost, simplified PAPRs while maintaining performance equivalent to medical-grade devices and have examined the technical and social issues toward societal implementation. This initiative has three main contributions:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p>It diversifies infection control tools by introducing a new countermeasure alongside vaccines and behavioral changes.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p>It offers a practical alternative to lockdown, reducing social and economic losses.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(3)</label><p>It provides a sustainable infrastructure for future pandemic preparedness through the design and deployment of low-cost PAPRs for everyday use.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Thus, this paper proposes a new option for airborne infection control and contributes to enhancing societal resilience.</p><p>The superior performance of PAPRs compared to standard face masks lies in the positive pressure maintained inside the hood, which physically blocks inward airflow through facial gaps. Moreover, PAPRs remove virus-laden particles through mechanical filtration, allowing virus-independent protection.</p><p>The authors&#8217; prototype PAPR [<xref rid="B18-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] is equipped with a HEPA filter, fan, and battery, with a total component cost of about 40 USD. The system supplies purified air via a HEPA filter (removal efficiency &#8805;99.97% at 0.3 &#956;m) into the hood to maintain positive pressure. Even if slight gaps form between the hood and the face, the direct inflow of unfiltered air is prevented. Exhaust air passes through nonwoven filters via natural pressure-driven flow, and even if the user is infected, this design is expected to suppress viral emission. This basic functionality is equivalent to that of commercial medical-grade PAPRs.</p><p>Although PAPRs provide high protective performance, it is important to clarify their societal significance by comparing them with other common protective equipment. The prototype PAPR developed in this study has unique value not only in terms of performance but also in cost and usability compared with existing N95 masks and medical-grade PAPRs. N95 masks are inexpensive and widely used, but they face challenges in terms of fit and comfort during long-term wear. On the other hand, commercial medical-grade PAPRs provide high protection but are priced on the order of 1000 USD, and their weight and wearing configuration impose limitations on daily use by the general public.</p><p>The prototype PAPR presented in this study maintains protective performance equivalent to that of medical-grade PAPRs while ensuring comfort through weight reduction and structural simplification and achieving low cost by utilizing commercially available components. In addition, the positive-pressure design reduces breathing resistance, thereby balancing user safety with reduced physiological burden. As a result, this system opens the possibility of a sustainable protective device suitable not only for medical settings but also for industrial environments and daily use by the general public.</p><p>This study was part of a project to develop a public-oriented PAPR as a socially deployable technology to replace lockdowns in the control of airborne infectious diseases such as COVID-19. In particular, this paper focuses on the development and validation of a real-time estimation method for respiratory flow and wearing conditions aimed at improving wearing comfort&#8212;an important issue in PAPR practical use.</p><p>In the authors&#8217; previous study [<xref rid="B19-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the airflow responses of the supply unit and exhaust filter were analyzed by connecting them to separate pressure buffers and evaluating their fluid response using a respiratory simulator. In contrast, this study constructed a new test platform&#8212;the &#8220;Respiratory Airflow Testbench&#8221;&#8212;in which the PAPR was worn directly on a mannequin head equipped with a respiratory simulator to more realistically evaluate the actual wearing state.</p><p>The prototype PAPR includes an Arduino UNO R4 WiFi controller and a differential-pressure sensor (SDP810), enabling the real-time estimation of respiratory flow <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>3e</sub></bold> based on <bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold> and <bold>V<sub>b</sub></bold>. The accuracy of <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>3e</sub></bold> was verified by comparing it with measured values <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>3m</sub></bold> obtained from a flow sensor. Furthermore, a BLE-based smartphone application was developed that displays the wearing status and leak status in real time, providing feedback to the user.</p><p>These features suggest the feasibility of extensions such as dynamic pressure control based on breathing activity and the detection of abnormal breathing or coughs. In the future, a PAPR Wearing Status Network Management System [<xref rid="B1-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] is envisioned to visualize and share risk at the societal level through the networking of wearing data.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-sensors-25-05340"><title>2. Development of a PAPR Prototype with Respiratory Flow Estimation and Leakage Detection Functions</title><p><xref rid="sensors-25-05340-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the prototype of a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) equipped with respiratory flow estimation and leakage detection functions. A lightweight work helmet shell was partially cut and modified to serve as a support structure for the hood and the intake/exhaust units.</p><p>An &#8220;air-supply unit (airtight room)&#8221; was constructed using white styrene board with a thickness of 5 mm, and a Sirocco fan (model: San Ace B76, manufacturer: Sanyo Denki Corp., Tokyo, Japan, maximum static pressure: 150 Pa, maximum flow rate: 360 L/min) was installed inside.</p><p>A transparent PVC sheet (thickness: 0.5 mm) was used for the shield (transparent window), and a Tyvek airtight cap was cut and used for the hood part. The tension of the elastic sealing cord was adjusted to prevent any gaps between the hood and the user&#8217;s face.</p><p>At the front of the air-supply unit, a HEPA filter for air purifiers (PMMS-DCHF, Iris Oyama Ltd., Sendai, Japan) with an effective surface area of approximately 700 cm<sup>2</sup> was installed. A thin nonwoven fabric filter (approx. 25 cm<sup>2</sup> surface area) was positioned in front of the ears as the exhaust filter in a configuration that allowed the ears to remain exposed for acoustic considerations.</p><p>General-purpose adhesives and hot-melt adhesives (HMAs) were used to bond the shell components such as the supply unit, exhaust filter, shield, and hood.</p><p>The controller used was an Arduino UNO R4 WiFi. The differential pressure between the inside of the hood and the external air was measured using a differential-pressure sensor (Model: SDP810-500 Pa, manufacturer: Sensirion, St&#228;fa, Switzerland). This sensor was connected via a Qwiic connector through a multiplexer (model: 8ch I2C Hub TCA9548A, manufacturer: Grove, San Francisco, CA, USA). The multiplexer allowed additional reference flowmeters to be connected later.</p><p>The battery voltage was stepped down using four resistors (2.5 k&#937; each) connected in series and measured via the analog input pin of the controller. Power for both the fan and the controller was supplied by a lithium-ion battery (rated 12 V) mounted on the back of the helmet shell.</p><p>In terms of airflow, purified air is supplied into the hood by the supply unit, maintaining positive pressure within the hood. Exhaust air is discharged through the exhaust filter due to the pressure difference.</p><p>The controller transmits the judged wearing status (ON/OFF) and leakage status (Leak/No Leak) to a dedicated Android smartphone application (&#8220;PAPR Wearing Status Monitor&#8221;) at regular intervals (default: approximately every 3 s) via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). As explained later, wearing status is determined using only the measured values of differential pressure <bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold> [Pa] and battery voltage <bold>V<sub>b</sub></bold> [V].</p><p>The prototype PAPR was developed by the author as a custom system assembled from commercially available components. Its total mass was approximately 656.1 g, including the battery (174.4 g), and the continuous operating time was about 320 min (5 h 20 min). The operating time can be extended depending on the battery capacity, and even for this prototype, more than 6 h of use is expected with capacity expansion.</p><p>For comparison, the commercially available PAPR &#8220;Versaflo TR-300+&#8221; manufactured by 3M (Maplewood, MN, USA, listed in [<xref rid="B19-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Table 1 [A]) has a total mass of approximately 1419.6 g, consisting of the belt-mounted air-supply unit (about 1107.7 g), the supply tube (about 201.9 g), and the hood (about 110.0 g). The fact that the mass of the prototype PAPR is less than half of this value is attributed to its integrated helmet-type structure and the use of lightweight materials, which contribute to improved comfort during long-term wear. However, for product development, it will be necessary to ensure an optimal balance between strength and weight.</p><p>The smartphone application &#8220;PAPR Wearing Status Monitor&#8221; receives and displays the status transmitted by the controller. When the wearing status is OFF, the screen background is white. When wearing is ON and leakage is detected (YES), the screen turns red (warning).

For more accurate evaluation, a method that uses the slope of the median trend of the integrated respiratory volume would be preferable. Nevertheless, in this study, considering the computational capacity of the controller, the integrated value itself in each interval was used as the judgment parameter. In principle, leak detection should be realized by an algorithm that accurately captures the trend of the integrated respiratory volume&#8212;interpreting &#8220;no change&#8221; as &#8216;no leak&#8217; and &#8220;decrease&#8221; as &#8216;leak present&#8217;.</p><p>In this study, leak detection was performed not by using the slope of a regression line but by the terminal value of the cumulative flow <bold><italic toggle="yes">I</italic></bold> = &#8747;<bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>3e</sub></bold> d<bold><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></bold> (discrete integration) within each evaluation interval.

To reduce endpoint dependency, future improvements will consider a method that directly estimates the time trend (slope) of the integrated value.</p><p>Furthermore, in practical application environments, changes in the flow&#8211;pressure relationship model due to component failure or degradation of PAPR parts may cause false positives (judging as leak present when no leak exists) or false negatives (failing to detect an actual leak). Therefore, it will be an important future task to introduce on-site re-evaluation methods and dynamic correction algorithms for model characteristics. For example, mechanisms such as periodic zero-point calibration and self-diagnosis functions could be implemented to track model changes in real time, thereby reducing false alarms and maintaining the reliability of leak detection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-sensors-25-05340"><title>4.

Calibration Method for Daily Use</title><p>In the daily use of PAPRs by the general public, regular maintenance is essential. However, under the &#8220;PAPR for Everyone&#8221; concept envisioned in this study, it is assumed that individuals wear PAPRs during outdoor activities and similar situations, thereby contributing to a reduction in airborne virus concentration in the environment. This could potentially eliminate the need for intensive disinfection and strict management as required in medical settings.</p><p>For instance, each PAPR constantly purifies air at a rate of approximately 200 L/min, which far exceeds the wearer&#8217;s resting respiratory flow (6&#8211;9 L/min). Most of the exhaust air is also discharged through an exhaust filter. Therefore, in environments where many people are wearing PAPRs, the overall concentration of airborne virus particles is expected to decrease naturally.</p><p>The key to the societal implementation of this technology is the development of a simple and field-applicable calibration method that can account for time-dependent changes in the fluid characteristics of the supply unit and exhaust filter, which are used in estimating the disturbance flow <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>3</sub></bold>. This is based on the estimation equation:<disp-formula><bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>3e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>, <bold>V<sub>b</sub></bold>) = <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>2e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>) &#8722; <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>1e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>, <bold>V<sub>b</sub></bold>)</disp-formula></p><p>This section describes how to characterize and correct each component.</p><p>To calculate the estimated disturbance flow <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>3e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>, <bold>V<sub>b</sub></bold>), it is necessary to pre-characterize the supply flow characteristics of the intake unit, <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>1e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>, <bold>V<sub>b</sub></bold>), and the exhaust flow characteristics of the exhaust filter, <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>2e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>). In this study, <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>1e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>, <bold>V<sub>b</sub></bold>) was first measured independently and its regression equation was derived.</p><p>Next, the PAPR was mounted on a mannequin head (standard model without penetration holes), and under the assumption of &#8220;no leakage,&#8221; <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>2e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>) = <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>1e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>, <bold>V<sub>b</sub></bold>) was set. Based on this relationship, <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>2e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>) was expressed in the form <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>2e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>) = &#945;&#183;<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>, and the coefficient &#945; was determined to be 8.55.</p><p>In practical operation, HEPA filters in the supply unit can be used continuously for several months. However, clogging or deformation due to external force may alter their characteristics. To accommodate such situations, the following procedure is proposed as a simple calibration method that can be conducted in a home environment:</p><p>(1) Self-diagnosis through open operation of the supply unit</p><p>The PAPR is operated in an open-air condition. If the HEPA filter in the supply unit is clogged, the pressure loss at the filter increases. Although the response may vary depending on the control method, under normal conditions the pump driving current <bold><italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sub>p</sub></bold> changes in response to a given voltage. By pre-calibrating this relationship, it may be possible to estimate the degree of filter degradation (change in pressure loss characteristics) based on the voltage&#8211;current characteristics at the start of operation. Based on this, <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>1e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>, <bold>V<sub>b</sub></bold>) can theoretically be corrected. Ip can be easily measured by the controller (Arduino UNO R4 WiFi) as the terminal voltage across a standard resistor.</p><p>(2) Correction of <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>2e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>) by fitting the PAPR on a mannequin or human subject</p><p>After correcting <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>1e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>, <bold>V<sub>b</sub></bold>), the PAPR is mounted on a mannequin head and <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>2e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>) is redefined assuming &#8220;no leakage&#8221; by setting <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>2e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>) = <bold><italic toggle="yes">Q</italic><sub>1e</sub></bold>(<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>, <bold>V<sub>b</sub></bold>). Alternatively, a human subject can wear the device and hold their breath for a short period to achieve the same result.</p><p>(3) Calibration warning based on operational monitoring</p><p>During regular use, continuous monitoring of operating parameters (<bold>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold>, <bold>V<sub>b</sub></bold>, <bold><italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sub>p</sub></bold>) in the supply unit can be used to detect changes in pressure loss characteristics. The system could then notify the user when steps (1) or (2) need to be performed.</p><p>Regarding the service life of HEPA filters, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recommends the replacement of HEPA filters used for radioactive aerosol control in nuclear facilities every 10 years after manufacture. However, there have been reports of use beyond this duration [<xref rid="B22-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Other sources suggest that the maximum safe usage period is 10 years under dry conditions and 5 years under humid conditions (e.g., spray or high humidity) [<xref rid="B23-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, HEPA filters used in household air purifiers are generally recommended to be replaced every 6 months to 1 year.</p><p>In addition, the PAPR developed in this study has the potential to be applied to a mechanism for detecting time-dependent performance changes of HEPA filters. However, the detailed verification of this capability remains a future task. This is because the degradation factors of HEPA filter characteristics are not limited to simple clogging but may also include deformation due to external forces, the adhesion of organic substances, changes in electrostatic charge, and environmental humidity (the adsorption of water molecules), all of which act in combination. Consequently, the experimental conditions must be set with great care. At present, even the design of experiments comparing normal filters with intentionally clogged filters&#8212;aimed at evaluating detection capability through changes in related parameters&#8212;still poses technical challenges. Therefore, this paper does not address experimental demonstration of filter clogging detection, but instead identifies it as a future task, with plans to systematically classify degradation factors and design corresponding evaluation systems.</p><p>Furthermore, the long-term stability of the entire PAPR system must also be examined. In particular, during extended use, not only the clogging or deformation of the HEPA filter, as mentioned above, but also the degradation of pump components (such as the motor, bearings, and impeller), accumulation of dirt, and even time-dependent deterioration of electronic components (e.g., MOS-FETs for pump driving) may alter the fluid characteristics. Therefore, an important future task will be to conduct long-term stability tests that include not only the filter but also the electrical and mechanical components in order to evaluate the overall reliability of the system.</p><p>With regard to calibration methods for daily use, this paper remains at the conceptual level, and further verification is required concerning their feasibility and simplicity. In particular, from the perspective of user-friendliness, it remains unclear whether the proposed self-diagnosis and calibration methods are applicable to ordinary users and whether users can correctly maintain the equipment. Future work will involve verification through actual user trials and usability evaluations, with improvements made to the methods as necessary.</p><p>In addition, during long-term use or routine diagnostics, it is desirable to incorporate a mechanism that recognizes characteristic patterns of fluid property changes associated with typical errors&#8212;such as filter clogging, motor malfunction, and the damage or deformation of the flow path&#8212;and provides feedback to the user regarding the likely cause of the error. Such an error-feedback mechanism would encourage appropriate user responses and is essential for maintaining the reliability of the equipment.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-sensors-25-05340"><title>4.3. Expansion to Biosensing and Environmental Sensing</title><p>Under the concept of &#8220;PAPR for Everyone,&#8221; the envisioned PAPR is a device equipped with power, computational capabilities, and a head-mounted support system, designed to be worn continuously by the public during outdoor activities in a pandemic situation. Such a continuously wearable PAPR has wide potential applications in both biosensing and environmental sensing.</p><p>As an example of biosensing, the differential-pressure sensor used in this study can be utilized for cough detection and respiratory pattern analysis, enabling the estimation of the user&#8217;s health status. In addition, various sensors that measure biometric information&#8212;such as body temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and brain activity&#8212;can also be integrated. Examples include temperature sensors, photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, cuffless blood pressure estimation sensors, and EEG sensors. These could support daily health monitoring.</p><p>For environmental sensing, it is feasible to mount sensors that measure parameters such as the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, ambient temperature, humidity, illumination, particulate matter concentration (e.g., PM2.5), and noise level. In particular, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is a widely recognized indicator of indoor ventilation conditions and is strongly correlated with the volumetric concentration of exhaled aerosols and viral load in the air. As such, it can serve as a critical metric for evaluating infection risk [<xref rid="B24-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, in the field of gas detection technology, advances have been reported in high-sensitivity and high-selectivity sensors based on piezoelectric composites [<xref rid="B26-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the area of wearable biomonitoring, it has also been demonstrated that piezoresistive sensors based on nanofibers can sensitively detect respiratory patterns and pulse waves [<xref rid="B27-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, by constructing a network-based management system that collects and analyzes biosensing and environmental sensing data in real time from individual PAPR units, it may become possible to clarify infection mechanisms and establish more efficient control strategies through big data analytics. For instance, the system could function as a highly accurate contact tracing application. If abnormal respiratory patterns are detected in a specific area, the system could also assist in the early identification of infection clusters and the optimization of movement restrictions.</p><p>In such systems, where biometric and behavioral information is centrally collected, privacy protection and proper information governance are indispensable. In particular, when data are linked to personal identifiers or combined with location information, design and operational guidelines that ensure privacy&#8212;such as anonymization, decentralized management, and purpose limitation&#8212;will be required [<xref rid="B28-sensors-25-05340" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, to handle networked data securely, standard cybersecurity measures such as authentication, encrypted communication, and intrusion detection must be combined. In applications such as real-time alerts or the visualization of infection risk, it is also crucial to keep the transmission and processing delays of sensor information within acceptable limits. These challenges remain important issues to be addressed for the societal implementation of the proposed system.</p><p>Differences in fit arising from variations in head size and shape are directly linked to leakage and can become a major source of error in the estimation of respiratory parameters. Therefore, the optimization of the hood, particularly the sealing section, is desirable. Specifically, by fabricating the sealing part with a 3D printer based on individual 3D shape measurements, it would be possible to realize a PAPR that ideally fits each user. If sufficient tightness is ensured and leakage is suppressed, the method proposed in this paper is expected to enable the robust and accurate estimation of respiratory parameters using only differential pressure and battery voltage. The data presented in this study represent typical measurement results, and no significant variations were observed across multiple trials, suggesting a certain degree of validity in terms of reproducibility. In future work, additional experiments will be conducted with representative user groups to statistically verify the reproducibility and reliability of the measurements, and based on the results, we plan to evaluate the model accuracy and develop correction methods as necessary.</p><p>The results presented in this paper represent typical measurement examples and were not arbitrarily selected. In the developed Respiratory Airflow Testbench (<xref rid="sensors-25-05340-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), the cylinder&#8211;piston drive was operated manually to simulate respiratory airflow. However, with manual operation, it is difficult to systematically control respiratory amplitude and frequency. Therefore, future work will involve introducing a linear actuator drive to construct an experimental system capable of precisely controlling respiratory patterns. Furthermore, by equipping the system with two separate cylinder&#8211;piston drives for exhalation and inhalation; adjusting CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, O<sub>2</sub> concentration, and humidity on the exhalation side; and measuring the air composition on the inhalation side, it will be possible to reproduce (control and measure) the air circulation inside the hood. This approach is expected to enable the performance evaluation of the system under various workload and physiological conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-sensors-25-05340"><title>5.
