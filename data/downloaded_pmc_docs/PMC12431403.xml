Despite ongoing advancements in diagnostic and treatment methods, the prognosis for NSCLC remains poor, with the five-year survival rate remaining low [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, the five-year survival rate for NSCLC patients (all stages) is estimated at 26.4%, while for advanced or metastatic NSCLC, the five-year survival rate remains relatively low. For instance, the SEER database reports that the five-year survival rate for stage IV NSCLC patients is estimated at 5.8%. This rate is even lower for stage IV patients aged 65 years and older, at 4.6%, compared to 7.5% for patients younger than 65 years [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Notably, the epidemiological characteristics of NSCLC are undergoing significant changes due to shifts in population demographics and smoking patterns, with adenocarcinoma becoming the most common and rapidly increasing subtype [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, groundbreaking progress in NSCLC treatment strategies has led to an integrated therapeutic approach combining targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and traditional chemotherapy. Within targeted therapy, EGFR-TKIs, particularly osimertinib, have proven highly effective for patients with EGFR mutations due to their exceptional central nervous system penetration and favorable safety profile [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have become the standard treatment for patients with driver gene-negative tumors, while novel immunotherapies such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and bispecific antibodies show significant promise for future applications [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For patients with locally advanced NSCLC, the adoption of multidisciplinary collaborative treatment models and perioperative immunotherapy has significantly improved disease control [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, in clinical scenarios such as immunotherapy-resistant or driver gene-negative cancers, chemotherapy agents like docetaxel continue to provide essential therapeutic benefits [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Docetaxel is a semi-synthetic derivative of paclitaxel, commonly used as part of second-line treatment regimens for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly following the failure of platinum-based chemotherapy (such as cisplatin or carboplatin) [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, it is frequently combined with other therapeutic approaches, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, to enhance treatment efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the widespread use of docetaxel in combination or sequential therapies complicates the analysis of its adverse drug reactions (ADEs) [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The challenge arises from the difficulty in isolating and attributing ADEs specifically to docetaxel when it is used in combination with other drugs or as part of a multi-drug regimen. This often leads to confounding factors, making the identification of adverse effects directly caused by docetaxel more complex.</p><p>To minimize the impact of such confounding factors, this study excluded reports involving the co-administration of other drugs through sensitivity analysis. In this manner, we ensured a higher degree of accuracy in our data analysis, further clarifying the risks and patterns of docetaxel-related adverse reactions.</p><p>Since its FDA approval in 1996, docetaxel has established a central role in the treatment of various malignant tumors [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Docetaxel belongs to a class of chemotherapy drugs called taxanes [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This drug works by specifically binding to tubulin, preventing microtubule depolymerization, disrupting microtubule dynamics, and inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Taxanes block cell growth during mitosis, affecting both tumor cells and certain normal cells, which impacts normal tissue regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These actions make docetaxel a key agent in second-line treatment for NSCLC, especially after platinum-based therapies fail [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that combining docetaxel with immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly nivolumab, provides substantial clinical benefits for NSCLC patients who have previously failed immunotherapy, leading to significant improvements in progression-free and overall survival [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, combining docetaxel with radiotherapy and targeted therapies shows potential for synergistic effects [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Despite its significant clinical benefits, the use of docetaxel is limited by the development of resistance and severe adverse effects, including myelosuppression, neurotoxicity, and liver dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These challenges have driven ongoing research into the underlying resistance mechanisms and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies, providing new opportunities to improve clinical outcomes and advance personalized cancer treatments [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The widespread use of docetaxel in cancer treatment has resulted in an increasing number of reported adverse drug events (ADEs). However, comprehensive long-term efficacy and safety data are currently lacking, especially from large-scale real-world studies. To address this gap, this study conducted a thorough pharmacovigilance analysis using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. By analyzing docetaxel-related adverse event data from Q1 2004 to Q1 2024, we systematically assessed its specific side effects, temporal patterns, and gender differences. The findings from this analysis will provide valuable insights for medication monitoring and risk management in clinical practice, assisting healthcare professionals in optimizing treatment regimens and ensuring the safe use of docetaxel.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>2.1 Data sources, management, and study design</title><p>This study utilized data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, which collects spontaneous reports from consumers (CN), pharmacists (PH), physicians (MD), other healthcare professionals (HP), registered nurses (RN), and other individuals (OT). We included all adverse event reports from Q1 2004 to Q1 2024 in which docetaxel was identified as the primary suspected drug. The data management process strictly followed the FDA&#8217;s recommended procedures, focusing on two key steps: identifying and removing duplicate reports and standardizing adverse event terminology. Specifically, for reports with identical case identifiers (CASEID), the record with the most recent FDA receipt date (FDA_DT) was retained. If both CASEID and FDA_DT were identical, the report with the highest primary identifier (PRIMARYID) was kept. Adverse event terms were standardized using the MedDRA version 26.1 dictionary to ensure the accuracy of subsequent statistical analyses [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

We confirmed known adverse reactions listed in the drug&#8217;s labeling, including sepsis, pneumonia, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity reactions, thrombocytopenia, anorexia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, peripheral motor neuropathy, taste disturbances, arrhythmias, hypokalemia, hypertension, and bleeding. Additionally, we identified several adverse events not listed in the labeling, such as metabolism and nutrition disorders (e.g., dehydration, hyponatremia), blood and lymphatic system disorders (e.g., leukopenia), renal and urinary disorders (e.g., acute kidney injury, urinary tract infection), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (e.g., haemoptysis), gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., mucosal inflammation), and investigations (e.g., decreased white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase). Our findings highlight the ultimate importance of enhancing monitoring, especially within the first 30 days of treatment, to promptly identify and manage potential adverse reactions.</p><p>The association between docetaxel treatment and dehydration in NSCLC patients is particularly concerning. Our FAERS findings are supported by several key clinical trials. In the JAVELIN Lung 200 phase III study comparing docetaxel with avelumab, dehydration was reported as a serious adverse event in the docetaxel group, resulting in one treatment-related death [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The risk of dehydration appears to increase when docetaxel is combined with other drugs [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Several factors may contribute to docetaxel-induced dehydration: firstly, docetaxel can cause gastrointestinal toxicity, such as diarrhea, which was reported as a grade 3&#8211;5 adverse event in the JAVELIN trial, leading to fluid loss and electrolyte imbalance [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Secondly, as noted by Chouaid et al., anorexia and reduced oral intake associated with docetaxel may further exacerbate dehydration risk [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, healthcare providers should implement strict monitoring protocols to detect early signs of dehydration, particularly in elderly patients and those undergoing combination therapy. Preventive measures, such as adequate hydration support and patient education about fluid intake, may help mitigate this risk. Additionally, the economic impact of managing dehydration, which often requires hospitalization and supportive care, significantly increases the overall cost of managing adverse events in NSCLC treatment [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This analysis delves into the necessity of balancing docetaxel&#8217;s therapeutic benefits with the risk of dehydration-related complications, guiding clinical decision-making. Future studies should explore factors that predict susceptibility to docetaxel-induced dehydration and develop targeted prevention strategies.</p><p>Another significant adverse event is acute kidney injury. Our findings align with the JAVELIN Lung 200 study, which reported treatment-related deaths due to renal dysfunction in the docetaxel group [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Santana-Davila et al. further confirmed a substantial risk of acute kidney injury and dehydration-related complications in platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (29.2% vs. 15.5%, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01) [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying docetaxel-induced renal injury may include direct tubular toxicity, chemotherapy-induced dehydration, and individual susceptibility factors [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Consequently, it is recommended to assess renal function before treatment, monitor renal parameters regularly during therapy, provide timely hydration, and consider individualized dose adjustments for high-risk patients. These findings underscore the ultimate need for vigilant renal function monitoring and management during docetaxel treatment, and clinicians should be aware of the potential for acute kidney injury.</p><p>Hemoptysis during docetaxel treatment is a potentially fatal adverse event that is not adequately addressed in the drug&#8217;s labeling, significantly impacting its clinical application. Hemoptysis, as a life-threatening symptom, not only causes severe physical damage but also leads to considerable psychological stress and can jeopardize patient safety, potentially resulting in treatment discontinuation. Therefore, establishing a stringent monitoring protocol is essential, including regular evaluation of respiratory symptoms and bleeding risks. For patients experiencing hemoptysis, immediate hemostatic measures and airway management should be implemented, and treatment should be adjusted or discontinued if necessary to ensure patient safety. This proactive approach can effectively control symptoms and reduce the risk of fatal complications.</p><p>Our study also identified increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) as a significant adverse event in NSCLC patients treated with docetaxel. Liver dysfunction is common with chemotherapy drugs, and elevated GGT, an indicator of liver injury, requires particular attention. In the ASCEND-5 study, the incidence of GGT elevation in the chemotherapy group (including docetaxel) was 1% [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. GGT elevation may reflect hepatocellular damage, which could compromise treatment safety and necessitate treatment adjustments. Such liver dysfunction can affect drug metabolism and increase the risk of other complications. Given that GGT elevation is an important marker to monitor during docetaxel treatment, regular liver function monitoring is essential for NSCLC patients receiving docetaxel therapy [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This includes baseline liver evaluation before treatment, regular monitoring during therapy, and prompt adjustments if abnormalities arise. Proactively managing this adverse reaction through structured monitoring, timely interventions, and individualized dose adjustments is crucial for ensuring treatment safety and maximizing patient benefit.</p><p>The subgroup analysis of our study indicated that additional attention should be given to respiratory symptoms, such as dyspnea, respiratory failure, and interstitial lung disease, as well as infection-related complications like sepsis and neutropenic sepsis in male patients. In female patients, particular caution should be exercised regarding liver function abnormalities (e.g., elevated GGT, AST) and hair-related adverse reactions (e.g., alopecia, hair color changes). Notably, hair-related adverse events can cause significant psychological distress, especially in female patients [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Regarding age stratification, there were only nine reports for patients under 18, mostly involving off-label adverse events like urinary tract infections and herpes zoster. In the 18&#8211;65 age group, the most common adverse events were fatigue, alopecia, and anemia, which can severely impact quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In patients over 65, cardiovascular and respiratory complications, such as atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, and pulmonary embolism, should be closely monitored, as these may increase the risk of treatment-related mortality [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These age- and sex-specific adverse event patterns are crucial for tailoring individualized monitoring strategies and optimizing treatment plans. Clinicians should adopt appropriate preventive measures and monitoring plans based on the patient&#8217;s demographic characteristics when using docetaxel for treatment [<xref rid="pone.0331979.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the FAERS database, a voluntary reporting system used by consumers, doctors, and pharmacists, may contain incomplete or inaccurate data. For example, data on drug exposure in patients is not available. Second, the data analyzed in this study are limited, and larger datasets are needed to validate our findings. However, by focusing on both the drug itself and its indications, we have enhanced the specificity of the results. While disproportionality analysis effectively identifies positive signals for adverse events, it does not establish causality between docetaxel and these events. Future long-term prospective studies are needed to confirm the potential adverse reactions identified in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>This study offers a comprehensive analysis of docetaxel-related adverse events by utilizing data from the FAERS database, focusing on reports from the first quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2024.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;This is a well-written study that examined the real-world safety of docetaxel--a common chemotherapy agent used to treat several types of solid tumors--here specifically in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The authors leveraged adverse drug event (ADE) data from the publicly accessible FAERS from 2004 to 2024. Using several statistical methods, the authors identified multiple known ADEs but also several unlabeled events as well as age and gender differences in stratified analyses. The findings provide useful summary data to inform healthcare providers and patients regarding risk management in the use of docetaxel for NSCLC therapy. Nevertheless, the overall presentation could be significantly improved, and I have the following specific comments and concerns:</p><p>1. In the Introduction, the authors mentioned the five-year survival rate of NSCLC remains low. It would be more informative to provide actual number and source (e.g. 5-yr survival rate of late-stage NSCLC based on American Cancer Society&#8217;s Cancer Statistics (US) or WHO/IARC global survey). This allows readers to assess the updated information in context, especially in view of the recent improvement in lung cancer survival rates in some developed countries.</p><p>2. Regarding information on docetaxel, please briefly add the fact that it belongs to a general class of chemotherapy drugs (taxanes) that block cellular growth during mitosis, thus affecting both normal and tumor cells.</p><p>3. Since docetaxel is used primarily as a second-line drug or in combination therapy for NSCLC that has metastasized, it is sometimes difficult to tease out the ADEs of multiple treatments, even if docetaxel is reported as the primary suspected drug in the FAERS. Are data on first-line or combination treatment available so that investigators can sift through the cases to screen out confounding factors?</p><p>4. In the Methods section on statistical analysis, it is stated that an adverse event was identified as potential adverse reaction if any of the ROR, PRR, MGPS or BCPNN analysis methods met the positive determination threshold (as listed in Supplementary Tables 2). For example, the threshold criteria for ROR are the lower limit of 95% CI must be greater than 1 and number of events greater or equal to 3. However, when looking at the adverse events meeting the positive signal threshold (Supplementary Tables 3), I find some selected ADEs do not meet any of the positive threshold criteria. Again, as an example, the PT &#8220;malignant neoplasm progression&#8221; has ROR lower 95% CI=0.59 (not &gt;1); PRR= -0.72 (not&gt;=2); EBGM05=0.61 (not &gt;2); IC025= -0.75 (not &gt;0). Please explain and justify the threshold criteria. If there are any errors in this table, please correct.</p><p>5. It would be helpful to provide a website address or literature reference for the MedDRA dictionary mentioned in the Methods section.</p><p>6. In the study design (Figure 1), it shows that there are 1535 ADEs reporting docetaxel as the primary suspected drug and 4347 events of docetaxel induced ADEs. Please clarify the differences between the two searches and why only the former was included in the final analysis.</p><p>7. It seems the figure legends for Figures 1 to 3 are missing from the main manuscript. Also, Figure 3 is not cited in the text. Please add the missing information.</p><p>8. Please enlarge the font size and graph for Figure 2. It is difficult to view the variable labels as presented.</p><p>9. For Table 1, change the label for missing data from &#8220;Miss&#8221; to &#8220;Unknown.&#8221;</p><p>10. Please reformat Supplementary Tables 3 to 9 in the Supplementary Material file to ensure the table columns are wide enough to accommodate the numbers to prevent wrapping and allow clarity in viewing.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;This is a very interesting paper addressing the adverse effects of docetaxel. It presents a well-executed description of the findings, with an appropriate acknowledgment of the study&#8217;s limitations.</p><p>For the sake of improved clarity and readability, I would suggest the following:</p><p>Figure 1 could be refined, as it currently includes some dashes and symbols that seem out of place or may confuse the reader.</p><p>In the adverse effects graph, the categories "Investigations" and "Social circumstances" are unclear. It would be helpful to provide a brief explanation of what these terms refer to in this context.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Reviewer 1</p><p>1. In the Introduction, the authors mentioned the five-year survival rate of NSCLC remains low. It would be more informative to provide actual number and source (e.g. 5-yr survival rate of late-stage NSCLC based on American Cancer Society&#8217;s Cancer Statistics (US) or WHO/IARC global survey).</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you very much for your thoughtful comment and valuable suggestion regarding the inclusion of specific survival data in the Introduction. We truly appreciate your input, and, as you recommended, we have updated the manuscript to provide more precise figures on the five-year survival rate for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We have incorporated data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, which offers more detailed insights into the survival rates for NSCLC patients at various stages, including advanced or metastatic disease.</p><p>We hope that the revised text provides more context and up-to-date information, especially in light of recent improvements in survival rates in some developed countries.</p><p>Revised Text:</p><p>"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most prevalent form of lung cancer worldwide, comprising approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases [1, 2] and continuing to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths [3]. Despite ongoing advancements in diagnostic and treatment methods, the prognosis for NSCLC remains poor, with the five-year survival rate remaining low [2]. According to an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, the five-year survival rate for NSCLC patients (all stages) is estimated at 26.4%, while for advanced or metastatic NSCLC, the five-year survival rate remains relatively low. For instance, the SEER database reports that the five-year survival rate for stage IV NSCLC patients is estimated at 5.8%. This rate is even lower for stage IV patients aged 65 years and older, at 4.6%, compared to 7.5% for patients younger than 65 years [4]. Notably, the epidemiological characteristics of NSCLC are undergoing significant changes due to shifts in population demographics and smoking patterns, with adenocarcinoma becoming the most common and rapidly increasing subtype [3, 5]."</p><p>We hope this revision addresses your concern and enhances the manuscript's clarity and informational value.</p><p>2. Regarding information on docetaxel, please briefly add the fact that it belongs to a general class of chemotherapy drugs (taxanes) that block cellular growth during mitosis, thus affecting both normal and tumor cells.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We sincerely appreciate your thoughtful suggestion regarding the classification of docetaxel. As per your recommendation, we have revised the manuscript to clarify that docetaxel belongs to the taxane class of chemotherapy agents, which block cellular growth during mitosis. We have also highlighted how this mechanism of action affects both tumor cells and certain normal cells, which impacts normal tissue regeneration. We hope that this addition improves the understanding of docetaxel&#8217;s broader clinical implications.</p><p>Revised Text:</p><p>"Since its FDA approval in 1996, docetaxel has established a central role in the treatment of various malignant tumors [13, 14]. Docetaxel belongs to a class of chemotherapy drugs called taxanes [15, 16]. This drug works by specifically binding to tubulin, preventing microtubule depolymerization, disrupting microtubule dynamics, and inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [13, 17]. Taxanes block cell growth during mitosis, affecting both tumor cells and certain normal cells, which impacts normal tissue regeneration [15, 16]. These actions make docetaxel a key agent in second-line treatment for NSCLC, especially after platinum-based therapies fail [18, 19]. Recent studies have demonstrated that combining docetaxel with immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly nivolumab, provides substantial clinical benefits for NSCLC patients who have previously failed immunotherapy, leading to significant improvements in progression-free and overall survival [20, 21]. Additionally, combining docetaxel with radiotherapy and targeted therapies shows potential for synergistic effects [22]."</p><p>We hope this revision addresses your comment and enhances the clarity and completeness of the manuscript.</p><p>3. Since docetaxel is used primarily as a second-line drug or in combination therapy for NSCLC that has metastasized, it is sometimes difficult to tease out the ADEs of multiple treatments, even if docetaxel is reported as the primary suspected drug in the FAERS. Are data on first-line or combination treatment available so that investigators can sift through the cases to screen out confounding factors?</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you for your insightful and thoughtful comment regarding the challenges of isolating adverse drug events (ADEs) related to docetaxel, particularly in combination therapies or multi-drug regimens. We completely agree that this is a complex issue. In the revised manuscript, we have clarified that while docetaxel is widely used as a second-line treatment following platinum-based chemotherapy failure, its use in combination with other therapies does present challenges in distinguishing the specific ADEs caused by docetaxel alone.</p><p>To minimize the impact of confounding factors, we have conducted a sensitivity analysis that excluded reports involving the co-administration of other drugs. We hope this approach improves the accuracy of our data analysis and better clarifies the risks and patterns associated specifically with docetaxel-related ADEs.</p><p>Revised Text:</p><p>"Docetaxel is a semi-synthetic derivative of paclitaxel, commonly used as part of second-line treatment regimens for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly following the failure of platinum-based chemotherapy (such as cisplatin or carboplatin) [10]. Additionally, it is frequently combined with other therapeutic approaches, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, to enhance treatment efficacy [11]. However, the widespread use of docetaxel in combination or sequential therapies complicates the analysis of its adverse drug reactions (ADEs) [12]. The challenge arises from the difficulty in isolating and attributing ADEs specifically to docetaxel when it is used in combination with other drugs or as part of a multi-drug regimen. This often leads to confounding factors, making the identification of adverse effects directly caused by docetaxel more complex."</p><p>To minimize the impact of such confounding factors, this study excluded reports involving the co-administration of other drugs through sensitivity analysis. In this manner, we ensured a higher degree of accuracy in our data analysis, further clarifying the risks and patterns of docetaxel-related adverse reactions."</p><p>We hope that this additional explanation clarifies the steps we have taken to address the issue of confounding factors in our analysis and improves the overall quality of the manuscript.</p><p>4. In the Methods section on statistical analysis, it is stated that an adverse event was identified as a potential adverse reaction if any of the ROR, PRR, MGPS or BCPNN analysis methods met the positive determination threshold (as listed in Supplementary Tables 2). For example, the threshold criteria for ROR are the lower limit of 95% CI must be greater than 1 and number of events greater or equal to 3. However, when looking at the adverse events meeting the positive signal threshold (Supplementary Tables 3), I find some selected ADEs do not meet any of the positive threshold criteria. Again, as an example, the PT &#8220;malignant neoplasm progression&#8221; has ROR lower 95% CI=0.59 (not &gt;1); PRR= -0.72 (not&gt;=2); EBGM05=0.61 (not &gt;2); IC025= -0.75 (not &gt;0). Please explain and justify the threshold criteria. If there are any errors in this table, please correct.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you very much for your careful review and thoughtful comment. We appreciate your attention to the discrepancies between the adverse events listed in Supplementary Table 3 and the threshold criteria for statistical methods. After reviewing your comment, we can confirm that there was no error in the statistical analysis itself. However, we did identify that an incorrect version of the table was uploaded. Initially, we included both negative and positive signals in the table.</p><p>In response to your comment, we have now updated the table to only reflect those adverse events that meet the positive signal criteria as outlined in the Methods section. This ensures that the table is aligned with the threshold criteria for ROR, PRR, MGPS, and BCPNN analysis methods. We believe this change improves the clarity of the data presentation.</p><p>We hope this correction addresses your concern and provides a clearer view of the findings.</p><p>5. It would be helpful to provide a website address or literature reference for the MedDRA dictionary mentioned in the Methods section.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion regarding the inclusion of a reference or website address for the MedDRA dictionary. As you recommended, we have updated the manuscript to provide the official website for the MedDRA dictionary, which can be accessed for further information and the latest version. We have also added the relevant citation (reference 26) in the Methods section.</p><p>Revised Text:</p><p>"MedDRA dictionary information and the latest version can be accessed at the official website: [<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.meddra.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.meddra.org</ext-link>](<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.meddra.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.meddra.org</ext-link>)."</p><p>We hope this addition will help provide readers with a clearer reference for the MedDRA dictionary and its application in our analysis.</p><p>6. In the study design (Figure 1), it shows that there are 1535 ADEs reporting docetaxel as the primary suspected drug and 4347 events of docetaxel induced ADEs. Please clarify the differences between the two searches and why only the former was included in the final analysis.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you for your thoughtful question regarding the differences between the two searches and the inclusion of 1,535 reports in the final analysis. We would like to clarify that the 4,347 represents the total number of adverse events (AEs) recorded within these 1,535 reports. Since a single patient (or report) may experience multiple adverse events (for example, both "fever" and "neutropenia"), the total number of adverse events is much higher than the number of reports.</p><p>Therefore, it is not the case that only the 1,535 reports were included in the final analysis. The entire analysis was based on the 4,347 adverse events documented in these 1,535 reports. Frequency analysis and signal detection for adverse event types (such as Preferred Term (PT) terms) were performed using the total number of adverse events.</p><p>We hope this clarification resolves the confusion and provides a clearer understanding of our analysis approach.</p><p>7. It seems the figure legends for Figures 1 to 3 are missing from the main manuscript. Also, Figure 3 is not cited in the text. Please add the missing information.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding the missing figure legends for Figures 1 to 3 and the issue with Figure 3 not being cited in the text. We have reviewed the manuscript and made the necessary revisions:</p><p>Figure Legends: We have now added the legends for Figures 1 to 4 to ensure that all figures are clearly described.</p><p>Figure 3 Citation: We have ensured that Figure 3 is properly cited in the manuscript, particularly in the "3.6 Adverse Event Occurrence Time and Weibull Distribution Analysis" section.</p><p>Figure Legends:</p><p>Fig 1. Flowchart demonstrating the adverse event analysis process for Docetaxel using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database.</p><p>Fig 2. Proportion of adverse events by system organ class associated with Docetaxel. Explanation: The 'Investigations' category refers to adverse events related to abnormal laboratory test results. 'Social circumstances' refers to social factors that influence the patient's health status or reporting behavior.</p><p>Fig 3. Time to onset of Docetaxel-induced adverse events.</p><p>Fig 4. Cumulative incidence of Docetaxel-related adverse events over time.</p><p>We hope these revisions address your comment and improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p><p>8. Please enlarge the font size and graph for Figure 2. It is difficult to view the variable labels as presented.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding the font size and clarity of the graph in Figure 2. In response to your comment, we have made the following revisions to improve the presentation of the figure:</p><p>Font Size and Boldness: We have increased the font size and bolded the variable labels in Figure 2 to ensure they are clearer and more legible.</p><p>Image Resolution: We have also enhanced the resolution of Figure 2 to improve the overall clarity of the graph.</p><p>We believe these changes will improve the readability and overall quality of the figure.</p><p>9. For Table 1, change the label for missing data from &#8220;Miss&#8221; to &#8220;Unknown.&#8221;</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you for your helpful suggestion regarding the label for missing data in Table 1. We have made the requested change and updated the label from "Miss" to "Unknown." The revised table has been re-uploaded accordingly.</p><p>We appreciate your attention to detail and believe this modification improves the clarity of the manuscript.</p><p>10. Please reformat Supplementary Tables 3 to 9 in the Supplementary Material file to ensure the table columns are wide enough to accommodate the numbers to prevent wrapping and allow clarity in viewing.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion regarding the formatting of Supplementary Tables 3 to 9. We have adjusted the table columns to ensure they are wide enough to accommodate the numbers without wrapping, improving clarity and readability. The revised tables have been re-uploaded accordingly.</p><p>We appreciate your attention to detail and believe these changes enhance the presentation of the supplementary material.</p><p>Reviewer 2</p><p>1. Figure 1 could be refined, as it currently includes some dashes and symbols that seem out of place or may confuse the reader.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you for your constructive feedback regarding Figure 1. We have reviewed the figure and deleted the dashes and symbols that seemed out of place and could potentially confuse the reader. The revised figure has been re-uploaded accordingly.</p><p>We appreciate your suggestion, and we believe these changes enhance the clarity and presentation of the figure.</p><p>2. In the adverse effects graph, the categories "Investigations" and "Social circumstances" are unclear. It would be helpful to provide a brief explanation of what these terms refer to in this context.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding the clarity of the categories "Investigations" and "Social circumstances" in the adverse effects graph. In response to your suggestion, we have added explanations for these terms in the figure legend. Specifically:</p><p>The 'Investigations' category refers to adverse events related to abnormal laboratory test results.</p><p>The 'Social circumstances' category refers to social factors that influence the patient's health status or reporting behavior.</p><p>We believe this addition will help clarify these categories for the reader.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0331979.s010" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0331979.s010.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0331979.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0331979.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Yu</surname><given-names initials="G">Guocan</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Guocan Yu</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Guocan Yu</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj003" xml:lang="en" journal-id="PLoS One" journal-id-type="nlm-ta" ext-link-type="pubmed" xlink:href="40938818"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
