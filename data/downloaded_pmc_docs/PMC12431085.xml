In neurodegenerative disorders, these stressors are associated with accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) &#8211; organelles that store neutral lipids to provide energy and protect cells from lipid toxicity. However, the regulation of LD metabolism following TBI remains poorly understood. Using a <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic> model, we investigated how TBI influences LD accumulation, particularly in relation to aging and diet, other LD modulatory factors. Confocal microscopy of fly brains at one day after injury showed increases in both LD size and number. The rise in LD number occurred only in flies fed a carbohydrate-rich diet and was absent in those given a ketogenic diet (KD) or water, suggesting that glucose availability is necessary for LD formation post-injury and potentially underlying why KD and water do not elicit the deleterious outcomes observed with carbohydrates. Lipidomic analysis of fly heads further revealed elevated levels of triacylglycerol (TG) species typically stored in LDs, indicating enhanced lipid synthesis post-injury. By seven days post-injury, LD size and number returned to baseline levels observed in uninjured flies and remained stable through 14 days post-injury. However, by 21 days post-injury, uninjured flies showed a marked increase in LD number that was not observed in injured flies, although LD size increased in both groups. These findings suggest that TBI selectively impairs age-dependent production of new LDs without affecting the growth of existing LDs. Importantly, TG levels remained elevated in heads of injured flies, indicating that the reduction in LD number was not due to limited lipid availability. Together, our findings indicate that TBI acutely induces LD formation as a protective response but chronically impairs LD biogenesis, disrupting lipid homeostasis in an age- and diet-dependent manner that may contribute to neurodegeneration.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1NS114359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7042-9561</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Wassarman</surname><given-names>David A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number RF1NS114359 and by the UW-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, Graduate School, and Department of Medical Genetics.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="21"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its <xref rid="sec020" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its <xref rid="sec020" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI), resulting from external forces applied to the brain, affects millions of individuals worldwide each year, representing a major public health concern [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. TBI begins with a primary injury, followed by secondary injures that unfold over minutes to years [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Secondary injuries involve complex cellular and molecular processes that can lead to cognitive, emotional, and physical impairments as well as increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite extensive research, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying both short- and long-term consequences of TBI remain largely unresolved.</p><p>Identifying the cellular and molecular events that occur within minutes to hours after a primary injury is crucial for guiding treatment strategies, as these early responses are believed to influence both short- and long-term outcomes. Among the most important of these early responses are mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and neuroinflammation [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which initially engages the innate immune system. Notably, these same responses are also implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting shared mechanisms and offering insights into TBI pathology [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>One downstream consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation is the formation of lipid droplets (LDs), organelles that compartmentalize cytosolic lipids [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. LDs serve two main functions: they store lipids as a source of metabolic energy that can be accessed when needed, and they protect cells by sequestering excess or damaged lipids that could otherwise be toxic [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, LD accumulation may indicate increased lipid stress, including the presence of excess or toxic lipids. LDs consist of a core of neutral lipids, primarily triacylglycerol (TG) and sterol esters, surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer with associated peripheral and integral proteins that tend to be involved in lipid metabolism. Accumulation of LDs in the brain is influenced by a variety of biological and environmental factors, including aging and diet [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Aging may promote LD accumulation, potentially due to increased production of toxic lipids, while caloric restriction appears to limit this buildup by reducing lipid synthesis. Importantly, growing evidence suggests that LDs play a neuroprotective role in the face of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, acting as a cellular defense mechanism in response to metabolic stress [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>LD formation in glia is neuroprotective in a <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic> model in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated by selectively knocking down the <italic toggle="yes">ND42</italic> subunit of mitochondrial electron transport chain Complex I in photoreceptor neurons of the eye [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this model, neuronal ROS induces production of toxic lipid peroxides that are transferred to glia where they are incorporated into LDs. This lipid transfer depends on apolipoproteins, which have been linked to both TBI and AD. Genetic studies show that the <italic toggle="yes">apolipoprotein E4</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">apoE4</italic>) allele is associated with worse outcomes in both conditions [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition to LD formation protecting neurons from damage caused by lipid peroxides, a study of mammalian cells in culture indicates that astrocytes metabolize fatty acids in LDs through mitochondrial &#946;-oxidation to generate energy in response to increased neuronal activity [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Direct evidence linking LD formation to TBI has emerged from several models. In a mouse TBI model, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE); a byproduct of lipid peroxidation that impairs cellular function by forming covalent adducts with proteins, DNA, and phospholipids; accumulates in the hippocampus weeks and months post-injury, and LDs accumulate in hippocampal microglia &#8211; innate immune cells &#8211; months post-injury [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Early inhibition of mitochondrial fission reduces 4-HNE, LD formation, and neurodegeneration, implicating ROS production, a consequence of mitochondrial fission, in this response. Rodent TBI studies also consistently show that lipid peroxidation is an early and prominent feature of secondary injury cascades [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Finally, LD accumulation is observed in microglia in a zebrafish penetrating brain injury model and in postmortem cortical brain tissue from TBI patients [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Together, these findings support a neuroprotective role for LDs in TBI and highlight the need to understand how this mechanism intersects with other modulators of brain health that affect LD production, such as aging and diet.</p><p>To investigate effects of TBI on aging and diet mechanisms that control lipid and LD metabolism, we used a Drosophila TBI model in which brain injuries and associated polytrauma are induced using a High-Impact Trauma (HIT) device [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our previous studies support a role for LD metabolism in the primary injury response. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in LD metabolism are associated with early mortality following TBI, defined as death within 24 hours of injury [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Among these genes is <italic toggle="yes">lipid storage droplet-1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">lsd-1</italic>), the Drosophila ortholog of human <italic toggle="yes">Perilipin1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">PLIN1</italic>), which encodes an LD-associated protein involved in regulating lipolysis [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Additionally, neuroinflammation &#8211; triggered through innate immunity signaling pathways&#8211;is activated within 30 minutes of injury and remains elevated for at least 24 hours [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Inhibiting these pathways or specific downstream transcriptional targets, significantly reduces early mortality, implicating neuroinflammation as a major contributor to acute TBI-induced lethality [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Post-injury diet also plays a critical role in early mortality. Flies fed high-carbohydrate diets such as a standard cornmeal-molasses-yeast diet (CMYD) or &#8805;1 M glucose show significantly higher early mortality than those fed a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) or water, indicating that metabolism of carbohydrates &#8211; precursors for fatty acid and lipid synthesis &#8211; exacerbates early mortality [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Finally, flies that survive the initial 24 hours after TBI develop progressive neurodegeneration over the following weeks, underscoring the long-term effects of TBI in flies [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These findings suggest that investigating how TBI influences the effects of aging and diet on lipid and LD metabolism may reveal new strategies to improve TBI outcomes.</p><p>Using confocal microcopy, we observed that TBI triggered a rapid and substantial increase in both the size of individual LDs and the number of LDs per cell in fly brains. This effect was most pronounced in flies fed a high-carbohydrate diet after injury. Over the following weeks, the typical age-related accumulation of LDs was disrupted in injured flies. Furthermore, lipidomic analysis of fly heads shortly after injury showed an increase in TG species typically found in LDs. However, as flies aged, differences in the abundance of these lipid species no longer aligned with LD levels. These findings suggest that when exogenous carbohydrates are available, TBI initially causes an increase in lipids that are sequestered in LDs. However, over time, TBI impairs LD formation, possibly allowing age-related accumulation of lipids to contribute to long-term pathologies such as neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>TBI acutely increases LD size and number</title><p>To investigate LD dynamics following TBI, we used confocal microscopy of dissected fly brains to compare the size and number of LDs between injured and uninjured flies.

This multivariate statistical approach allowed visualization of overall differences between injured and uninjured samples and the identification of lipid species that most strongly contributed to group separation.

The top 20 differentiating lipid species were all TGs (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). The probability of this occurring by chance is exceedingly small (6.8 x 10<sup>-12</sup>), suggesting an important role for the TGs in the response to TBI. Furthermore, among these TGs, 97% of the fatty acid side chains had 12, 14, 16, or 18 carbon atoms, which are major energy substrates [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].

Accordingly, quantitation of at least 15 brains and 11,000 cells per brain for each condition, revealed that in both injured and uninjured flies, diet significantly affected individual LD size, LD number per cell, and total LD area per cell at 2 and 24&#8201;h (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332333.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

The underlying mechanism was activated by 2&#8201;h for glucose but not CMYD. The delay with CMYD may be due to the additional time required to digest complex carbohydrates to glucose.

These findings reveal a correlation between TBI-induced LD accumulation and early mortality across the different diets, suggesting that LDs either contribute directly to early mortality or arise as a result of processes that induce early mortality.

This may reflect the dual functions of LDs: under CMYD, increased LD abundance may result from the sequestration of lipid peroxides, which are associated with early mortality; in contrast, under KD, the increase in LDs may reflect storage of undamaged lipids for &#946;-oxidation, serving as an energy source that helps prevent early mortality [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0332333.g006" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0332333.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Confocal microscopy of LDs in the central brain of flies under different diet conditions.</title><p>Injured and uninjured 8-day old, female, <italic toggle="yes">w</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">1118</italic></sup> flies (rows) were fed different diets (CMYD, 2 M glucose, ketogenic diet, or water (columns)) and imaged 24&#8201;h post-injury.

Existing literature supports a three-step model of the brain&#8217;s response to TBI. (Step 1: initial response) TBI acutely triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation; (Step 2: lipid damage) this leads to rapid generation of ROS, lipid peroxidation, and production of toxic lipid species (<italic toggle="yes">e.g</italic>., 4-HNE); and (Step 3: LD formation) cells respond by sequestering lipids into LDs to prevent lipotoxicity and by trafficking LDs along microtubules to mitochondria to generate energy (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our findings extend this model by showing that high-carbohydrate diets post-TBI exacerbate LD accumulation (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332333.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), likely due to providing excess substrates for lipid synthesis. In contrast, low-carbohydrate diets may mitigate production of toxic lipid species. Additionally, while age-dependent accumulation of LDs likely serves as a protective mechanism against cumulative oxidative and metabolic stress, our findings indicate that in an injured brain, lipids are initially sequestered into LDs (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g002" ref-type="fig">Figs 2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332333.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332333.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), but over time, lipids accumulate to a greater extent (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) and are not properly sequestered into LDs (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332333.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), increasing the potential for lipotoxicity and contributing to neurodegeneration.</p><sec id="sec010"><title>Impaired trafficking of LDs along microtubules might contribute to CTE</title><p>The association of LDs with microtubules in axons of injured brains (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>) provides the first direct evidence, to our knowledge, that disrupted LD trafficking may contribute to the development of CTE pathology. CTE is characterized by microtubule disruption, impaired intracellular transport of cargoes, and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau, which destabilizes microtubules and compromises neuronal structural integrity [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our prior studies implicated the microtubule-associated proteins Lissencephaly-1 (Lis-1) and Patronin in TBI outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Lis-1 regulates dynein, the microtubule motor responsible for retrograde transport of many cargoes, including LDs [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], while Patronin stabilizes microtubules by protecting their minus ends from depolymerization [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. SNPs in the <italic toggle="yes">Lis-1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Patronin</italic> genes are associated with early mortality following TBI, and mutations in <italic toggle="yes">Lis-1</italic> enhance early mortality and neurodegeneration following TBI [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Furthermore, reduced expression of <italic toggle="yes">Lis-</italic>1 is associated with a late stage of CTE [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Together, these findings suggest that microtubule-dependent regulation of LD localization &#8211; particularly their trafficking to mitochondria (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>) &#8211; is a key component of the cellular response to TBI and defects in the process may contribute to the development of CTE pathology.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>TBI rewires effects of aging on LD accumulation</title><p>We found that a primary brain injury induces dynamic changes in LD abundance that can manifest weeks after a primary injury. LD size and number increased significantly at 24&#8201;h post-injury but returned to baseline within 7 days (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332333.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This resolution likely reflects recovery from the conditions that initially promoted LD accumulation &#8211; such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation &#8211; and may involve lipid breakdown by lipases or lipophagy, where LDs are engulfed by autophagosomes and degraded by lysosomes [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In the weeks following injury, LD number increased, consistent with prior observations in flies and mice [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. However, the typical age-related increase in LD abundance was attenuated in injured flies compared to uninjured controls (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g003" ref-type="fig">Figs 3B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332333.g003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). This difference was most pronounced at 21 days post-injured (<italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>., in 29 day old flies), when uninjured flies had significantly more LDs per cell (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) but similar LD size (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), suggesting that TBI impairs the formation of new LDs without affecting the growth of existing ones. This time point aligns with related physiological events in aging flies, suggesting that they may be functionally linked. First, brain lipid turnover peaks at around 25 days of age, as indicated by the ratio of newly synthesized lipids to total lipids during aging from 5 to 45 days [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Second, a transient spike in 4-HNE levels is observed in fly heads at approximately 38 days of age [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Third, flies injured at 0&#8211;7 day old and surviving the first 24&#8201;h exhibit normal survival for about 17 days, but begin dying at a higher rate than uninjured flies between 17 and 25 days of age [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Collectively, these findings suggest that TBI disrupts programmed changes in lipid and LD metabolism during aging, potentially contributing to neurodegeneration and other late-onset consequences of injury. In particular, a primary injury may acutely trigger LD metabolic events that typically occur later in life (<italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>., LD size and number in injured flies at 1 day post-injury was comparable to that of uninjured flies at 21 days post-injury) (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g003" ref-type="fig">Figs 3A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332333.g003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332333.t001" ref-type="table">Tables 1A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332333.t001" ref-type="table">1B</xref>). This early onset may contribute to accelerated, age-associated neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>TBI acts through diet-dependent pathways to influence LD accumulation</title><p>Our findings indicate that reducing carbohydrate intake &#8211; either by feeding KD or water immediately after TBI &#8211; may protect against injury-related damage by limiting production of toxic lipids, as reflected by the absence of new LD formation (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0332333.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2B</xref>). Similarly, carbohydrate-rich Western diets lead to worse TBI outcomes than KD in rodents [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Moreover, in a rat TBI model, KD-fed animals showed reduced oxidative stress and lower levels of 4-HNE-modified proteins at 6 and 24&#8201;h post-injury compared to those fed a high-carbohydrate, standard chow diet [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The protective effects of KD appear to be mediated by ROS scavenging and enhanced mitochondrial electron transport chain activity, suggesting that the absence of TBI-induced LD formation in KD-fed flies results from reduced upstream signals linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress.</p><p>Our prior data show that flies given only water post-injury experience substantially lower early mortality than those fed CMYD, with the protective effect most pronounced when water is provided between 2 and 8&#8201;h after injury [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Similarly, Davis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2008) showed in a rat TBI model that 24&#8201;h of water-only fasting after injury compared to unrestricted access to a balanced diet reduced lesion volume, mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS production, and lipid peroxidation and improved cognitive function [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>A major limitation of this study is that it was conducted in a single genetic background. Our studies in flies, along with studies in rodents and humans, demonstrate that genetic background strongly influences the outcomes of TBI [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Rodents receiving identical primary injuries can exhibit markedly different outcomes depending on their genotype [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. This variation underpins our GWAS analyses that identified associations between early mortality following TBI and SNPs in <italic toggle="yes">lsd-1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Lis-1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Patronin</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In our experiments using 30 inbred fly lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], early mortality following TBI varied substantially across genotypes [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Furthermore, factors such as age at the time of injury and post-injury diet influenced genetically distinct secondary injury pathways. For instance, while most DGRP fly lines showed higher early mortality when injured at an older age and when fed CMYD rather than water, DGRP439 was sensitive to age but not diet &#8211; indicating genetic-based resistance to the carbohydrate-driven early mortality pathway. In contrast, DGRP381 was diet-sensitive but not age-sensitive. These findings suggest that lipid and LD metabolism responses following TBI in <italic toggle="yes">w</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">1118</italic></sup> flies are unlikely to generalize across other genetic backgrounds. Understanding how genetics differences affect lipid and LD metabolism in flies may ultimately inform the development of personalized therapies for genetically diverse human populations.</p><p>Additionally, because flies that died were not examined, it remains unclear whether LD accumulation is protective or detrimental in the context of early mortality. The elevated LD levels observed in flies that survived one day post-injury is consistent with a protective role, potentially by sequestering toxic lipids and supplying energy to support neuronal recovery. However, it is also possible that excessive LDs accumulation is detrimental, and that survivors had lower LD levels than those that died. To resolve this, it will be necessary to compare animals that will survive to those that are fated to die within one day following TBI. This is feasible in flies, as increased intestinal permeability after TBI reliably marks individuals that will die within one day [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Therefore, to determine the functional role of LDs, their levels should be measured in flies exhibiting intestinal barrier dysfunction to determine whether LD accumulation correlates positively or negatively with early mortality.</p><p>Finally, an important confounding factor in the interpretation of both the confocal microscopy and lipidomic data is that these analyses were performed on bulk tissue &#8211; whole brains in the case of microscopy and whole heads for lipidomic analysis. As a result, these data represent an average signal across multiple cell types, potentially obscuring cell type-specific responses to TBI. LDs are known to vary in size, abundance, and function across different brain cell types [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Following TBI, it is possible that LDs increase in size and/or number in some cell populations while decreasing in others or that certain lipid species are differentially regulated depending on the cell type. Such heterogeneity could not only lead to misinterpretation of the directionality or magnitude of the response but also mask meaningful biological effects. Our microscopy data (<xref rid="pone.0332333.g001" ref-type="fig">Figs 1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0332333.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0332333.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0332333.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, and <xref rid="pone.0332333.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.) do not clarify whether TBI-, aging-, and diet-induced LD changes in LD size and number occur in neurons or glia. Demonstrating neuronal localization would be paradigm-shifting, as glia are currently considered the primary site of stress-induced LD accumulation [<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332333.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. To resolve these ambiguities, future studies incorporating cell type-specific labeling, sorting, or single-cell approaches will be critical to accurately characterize how TBI alters lipid and LD metabolism. Nonetheless, bulk tissue analyses presented here have been tremendously informative, providing foundational understanding of lipid and LD alterations after TBI and offering critical impetus for pursing more refined, cell type-specific investigations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec014"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Drosophila stocks and husbandry</title><p>Flies were maintained on a standard fly food, cornmeal-molasses-yeast diet (CMYD), at 25&#176;C, unless otherwise stated.

Normalized values for samples were then averaged (<italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>., each column was averaged) and each lipid species was divided by the average. Data from positive and negative ion modes were combined into a single file, and unique identifiers were added for lipid species with the same name. Normalized data were saved as a CSV file and analyzed by Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) using MetaboAnalyst 6.0, which generated <xref rid="pone.0332333.g005" ref-type="fig">Figs 5A</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332333.g005" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>.

A major issue is that although they detect a significant increase in LD number 21d after the injury, these are not detectable after further aging. Furthermore, the area of LDs is not significantly different at any of the later timepoints. Concerning the lipids, although there are also differences at 21d, later timepoints have not been analyzed and so it is unknown whether changes in the lipid composition persist that could be the basis for the increased susceptibility. Another concern is that the statement that there is abnormal trafficking of microtubule is not supported by experimental data and it is difficult to judge the effects on microtubule in figure 4A and B; although at 14d the number of LDs should be about the same in uninjured and injured flies from their data, there are more LDs in the picture of the uninjured flies and it is not clear whether the pictures are from comparable regions of the brain. The authors point out that it is an important question whether the LDs are in glia or neurons which could be easily addressed by neuronal markers.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript by Rimkus et al. reports a detailed investigation of brain lipid metabolism dynamics in a drosophila model of TBI. Previous investigations from this group are consistent with results obtained from other groups that investigate the fruit fly to model TBI using different injury mechanisms. The application of lipidomics is novel to fly TBI models and complements the advanced imaging techniques. The data from all fly-TBI groups is, wherever comparisons are possible, also consistent with the comparatively low-resolution knowledge obtained from mammalian models. This manuscript is well written. The authors go to great lengths in describing their results in detail which may render the manuscript somewhat cumbersome in some sections.</p><p>Comments</p><p>Abstract line 34-37 how do we know that TBI selectively impairs LD production as opposed to LD degradation?</p><p>Although our data do not definitively distinguish whether TBI affects LD production versus degradation at 21 days post-injury, our lipidomic results &#8211; along with findings from other studies (references 32, 47, 55, and 75) &#8211; support a role for impaired LD production. Therefore, we believe the interpretation that &#8216;These findings suggest that TBI selectively impairs age-dependent production of new LDs without affecting the growth of existing LDs&#8217; is accurate, while still allowing for the possibility that degradation may also be involved.</p><p>Introduction: line 58-59. This is an important statement and this reviewer would have appreciated higher-level references to substantiate it. A similar concern applies to reference 11, published in Heliyon. These references to somewhat nebulous review articles are in contrast to the high-quality references in the subsequent paragraphs.</p><p>The reviewer makes a good point. To address this, for TBI, we cited primary research articles and review articles that highlight mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation as early contributors to TBI outcomes (references 9-18). For neurodegenerative disorders, we cited reviews discussing roles of these same mechanisms in Alzheimer&#8217;s, Parkinson&#8217;s, and Huntington&#8217;s diseases (references 19-27).</p><p>What is the role of proteins in the formation and maintenance of LDs and could impaired protein (e.g. apolipoproteins) synthesis result in the observed changes?</p><p>Proteins, including apolipoproteins, are critical for formation and maintenance of LDs and contribute to TBI-induced changes. As noted in lines 116-121, our GWAS data implicate several LD-related proteins in early mortality after TBI; however, the current data are insufficient to propose specific protein-level mechanisms.</p><p>Therefore, the described changes in lipid metabolism described in this manuscript are a valuable addition to the fund of knowledge about mechanism of the secondary injury after TBI.</p><p>Side note: &#8216;cargo&#8364;s is inconsistently spelled in the discussion.</p><p>Cargos was changed to cargoes on page 14.</p><p>Line 365 ff: the references to clinical nutrition guidelines may be correct but the causality &#8211; use of saline instead of glucose-containing solutions is inaccurate. The reasoning was primarily avoidance of hypoosmotic solutions. It may be a bit too far stretched to cite antiquated clinical nutrition guidelines (which reflect decades old and frequently obsolete clinical insights) in a cutting-edge research paper. Supporting it with a &#8216;narrative review&#8217; (the least rigorous form of review ref 63) only weakens the argument. I would suggest leaving ref 62 and removing the rest of the paragraph lines 371-374.</p><p>We appreciate the insights of the reviewer and have followed their suggestion of deleting lines 371-374 and the accompanying citations.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript by Rimkus et al describes changes in lipids and lipid droplets that occur after TBI, suggesting that these could contribute to the susceptibility to develop neurodegeneration later.</p><p>A major issue is that although they detect a significant increase in LD number 21d after the injury, these are not detectable after further aging. Furthermore, the area of LDs is not significantly different at any of the later timepoints.</p><p>At 21 days, LD number increased in uninjured but not injured flies. As noted in lines 381-397, this may reflect other phenotypes that emerge around this time in uninjured flies (references 32, 47, 55, and 75). A significant difference in LD area was not only observed at 21 days but also 35 days (Figure 3C).</p><p>Concerning the lipids, although there are also differences at 21d, later timepoints have not been analyzed and so it is unknown whether changes in the lipid composition persist that could be the basis for the increased susceptibility.</p><p>We agree that additional time points would have helped determined whether changes in lipid composition persist. However, due to the high cost of lipidomic analysis, we were limited in the number of time points that could be included.</p><p>Another concern is that the statement that there is abnormal trafficking of microtubule is not supported by experimental data and it is difficult to judge the effects on microtubule in figure 4A and B; although at 14d the number of LDs should be about the same in uninjured and injured flies from their data, there are more LDs in the picture of the uninjured flies and it is not clear whether the pictures are from comparable regions of the brain.</p><p>We agree that the images in Figures 4A and B do not clearly support the text due to differences in microtubule orientation. To address this, we replaced Figure 4B with one that matches the orientation of Figure 4A.</p><p>The authors point out that it is an important question whether the LDs are in glia or neurons which could be easily addressed by neuronal markers.</p><p>It is possible to determine whether LDs are located in glia or neurons by labeling neuronal or glial cell membranes and performing 3D reconstruction. We plan to pursue this in future studies, but it is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0332333.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0332333.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Kobeissy</surname><given-names initials="F">Firas</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Firas Kobeissy</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Firas Kobeissy</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj004" xml:lang="en" journal-id="PLoS One" journal-id-type="nlm-ta" ext-link-type="pubmed" xlink:href="40938910"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
