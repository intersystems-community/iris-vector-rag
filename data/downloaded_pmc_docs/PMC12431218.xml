Such commitments can create hectic and stressful work schedules, which may impact on well-being and cognition. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that brief mindfulness coaching (three 1.5 hour online group sessions over 12 weeks) can benefit medical scientists. We conducted a waitlist-controlled intervention study (n&#8201;=&#8201;43) with M.D./Ph.D. preclinical or graduate students and post M.D./Ph.D. trainees/faculty. Assessments of quantitative outcomes included self-reports of burnout, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being, as well as objective neuro-cognitive assessments. The results showed no effect of intervention on self-report measures. However, amongst cognitive measures, selective attention performance was significantly improved following the intervention (bias corrected effect size, Hedges&#8217; g&#8201;=&#8201;1.13, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.005). Extent of improvement in selective attention correlated with suppression of visual alpha oscillations &#8211; a neural marker for distractibility &#8211; measured using electroencephalography (EEG) (r&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.32, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). Qualitative feedback showed that after receiving the intervention, participants in both study arms equally rated the overall experience as &#8220;very good&#8221; (3.70&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.98 out 5). They also appreciated that the intervention emphasized healthy lifestyle behaviors, and contributed to mindfulness, compassion, and a sense of community. A majority (57%) of the participants reported that they expect to change their well-being related behaviors because of the intervention. Overall, this study suggests the utility of brief mindfulness coaching to improve selective attention skills in medical scientists and that more needs to be done to enhance subjective well-being in this healthcare workforce.</p><p><bold>Trial registration:</bold> The study was registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry (ISRCTN16736293) at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.isrctn.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.isrctn.com/</ext-link>.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1T32GM121318-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>David M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32GM007198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Hemal H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004142</institution-id><institution>Society of The Friendly Sons and Daughters of Saint Patrick</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BX005229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Hemal H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, NIH/NIGMS 1T32GM121318-01 (DMR, HHP), involved UCSD-MSTP trainees supported by NIH/NIGMS 5T32GM007198, and a Research Career Scientist Award from the Veterans Administration (BX005229 to HHP).

Introduction</title><p>The path of training to become a physician-scientist can be a long and potentially isolating journey. Such a career aims to bridge biomedical research and clinical care [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is a unique role to learn from patient experiences that inspire new research questions and to use scientific discovery to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics. The training in the U.S. often consists of pursuit of a dual-degree program, M.D./Ph.D., sometimes in a NIH-supported Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). Such programs transpire over 8&#8211;9 years before graduates undertake clinical residencies [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Not only do these trainees toil through the rigorous workload of both medical school and graduate school, but their training integrates those environments and involves pressure to be efficient and accelerate through dual degree training. Transient states of belonging with peers can promote feelings of isolation among M.D./Ph.D. students, during post-M.D./Ph.D. training and for junior faculty [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For M.D./Ph.D. trainees, transitions between medical school and graduate school can be particularly stressful and are challenging for M.D.s who undertake laboratory efforts [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Physician-scientists in training may lack a supportive community and are at risk for poor well-being and burnout, a particular problem for individuals from groups underrepresented in the physician scientist community [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Physicians have a high rate of burnout, defined as &#8220;workplace stress that has not been successfully managed&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Some common symptoms of burnout are: feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; increased mental distance from one&#8217;s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one&#8217;s job; and reduced professional efficacy. This decline is evident through slower reaction times, increased error rates, or greater work fluctuations, ultimately leading to reduced work efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Based on prior reports on job demands and wellbeing, our theoretical assumption is that a high-pressure professional environment may affect the attentional capabilities and broader cognitive capacity of the physicians [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The restoration of this reduction in attentional capabilities can be explained by the attentional-resource or energetic-capacity model [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] that assumes depletion of a hypothetical reservoir of resources during work and recovery during rest. This model is based on Kaplan&#8217;s attention-restoration theory (ART) [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which emphasizes that &#8220;recovery is not only a function of leisure time but depends on the context where rest takes place.&#8221; ART is a psycho-sociological theory that explores the dynamics of recovery and stress within real-world contexts of work and leisure. Hence, in the current study we propose an intervention program that would equip physicians with skills, to use their period of rest actively to foster objectively measurable improvements in attentional or cognitive performance, as well as nurture subjective well-being.</p><p>Well-being can be defined as a positive state experienced by individuals, primarily focused on how people evaluate their lives, ranging from momentary moods to overall life satisfaction judgments [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Burnout rates in medical professionals are currently estimated at 44%, much higher than in other professions [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, the COVID19 pandemic exacerbated distress in healthcare workers and has been associated with dropout from training and reduction of work hours [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which ultimately impacts the entire healthcare system. A recent study on medical trainees demonstrated the link between the constructs of burnout and well-being, reporting occurrence of burnout when the well-being reservoir was depleted [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hence, a need exists for interventions that can help reduce burnout and promote well-being, especially for individuals training as medical scientists [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Research has shown that group-based wellness interventions, such as group counseling and psychotherapy, improve well-being and cognition, likely benefitting from shared experiences that facilitate cohesion and interaction among the group members [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the past three decades, mindfulness-based interventions have received attention for alleviating stress and burnout symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, it can be challenging for physicians to accommodate their schedules to participate in traditional mindfulness trainings, which usually last up to 8 weeks, requiring 2.5 hours per week for didactics and practice [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Also, having a fixed routine and coordinating in-person with a mindfulness coach can be a logistical challenge.</p><p>Given the need for implementing time-efficient well-being interventions for clinicians, particularly clinician scientists, we hypothesized that a digital intervention approach that integrates brief, online group mindfulness sessions led by expert coaches might be a useful way to enhance well-being. The intervention offered three coaching sessions, each for 1.5 hours, over one academic quarter (about 3 months), in addition to encouragement to practice at home. In each session the coaches conducted focused mindfulness exercises and led an interactive discussion on health, mindfulness, well-being, self-compassion and resilience, and leadership training. The group intervention was scheduled to accommodate the preferred times of the program participants. We evaluated change on self-report scales of burnout, mindfulness, self-compassion and well-being and compared outcomes to a control group that did not receive the intervention. Such self-report measures have been used in other mindfulness-integrated intervention studies [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and to test mindfulness programs in physician cohorts [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For example, a study on physicians (n&#8201;=&#8201;19) [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] demonstrated that video-module-based mindfulness intervention could significantly reduce the stress and symptoms of burnout, such as emotional exhaustion, but the study lacked a control group. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of mindfulness in physicians (n&#8201;=&#8201;33) [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] demonstrated the improvement in burnout symptoms and enhanced mindfulness. Yet, these studies only focused on self-report measures. Subjective measures offer the advantage of providing insight into participants&#8217; personal assessments and feelings; however, they are susceptible to biases such as demand characteristics or tendencies toward certain self-presentation styles [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To mitigate these biases, objective measures, including cognitive function measures and their associated neural mechanisms, can offer a more comprehensive understanding of the intervention program&#8217;s effectiveness. Moreover, given the evidence gap on objective outcomes in this literature, here we also sought to measure objective benefits of the intervention, specifically whether it enhances cognitive functioning abilities and engenders neuroplasticity. Thus, electroencephalography (EEG)-integrated objective cognitive assessments are a major strength and novelty of this study.</p><p>Cognitive abilities are fundamental to daily life functioning. There are several reports demonstrating that mindfulness-based interventions improve components of cognition such as attention and working memory [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Also the process of meditation itself encompasses a wide range of cognitive components during the practice itself such as selective attention, distractor suppression and conflict monitoring [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no research on physician trainees that has assessed the modulation of cognitive functions driven by mindfulness intervention. Hence, here we implemented a scalable platform, the Brain Engagement (<italic toggle="yes">BrainE&#169;</italic>) tool developed for free academic use by the Neural Engineering and Translation Labs (NEATLabs), for measuring core aspects of cognition. The <italic toggle="yes">BrainE&#169;</italic> tool delivers standard cognitive assessments synchronized with neural recordings using EEG [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We have validated the reliability of <italic toggle="yes">BrainE&#169;</italic> and shown its utility in measuring cognitive changes across the lifespan [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We have also demonstrated its relevance in predicting mental health, well-being and burnout [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Here we deploy the <italic toggle="yes">BrainE&#169;</italic> platform to measure post vs. pre-intervention changes in the mindfulness intervention group and compare outcomes with repeat assessments in a control group that controlled for practice effects of repeat assessments. Specifically, we investigated whether the intervention can alter foundational cognitive abilities of selective attention, working memory, and interference processing of both non-emotional and emotional distractors. It is important to study different facets of cognition in this context as it has been postulated that mindfulness training may variably impact different forms of cognition depending on several factors, such as style of practice, target cohorts, coach characteristics, and environmental factors [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>Multidimensional cognitive assessments are also justified given that a recent metanalytic study reported that burnout may impair memory, attention and executive functioning and recommended mindfulness training as a protective remedy [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Our theoretical assumption is that the mindfulness training offered to physician trainees may facilitate improvements in present-moment-awareness and focus by cumulative practice over the intervention period that would be reflected in improved cognitive outcomes as well as concurrent neuroplasticity [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Furthermore, there is very limited literature exploring the impact of burnout on brain neuroplasticity among physicians [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. EEG measures can provide insights into neural plasticity induced by the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], which has not been applied in the context of interventions for the healthcare community apart from a couple of recent studies [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]). In summary, we hypothesize that brief mindfulness training may equip physicians with mental skills that facilitate improvement of wellbeing, general cognition as well as neural changes that underlie those cognitive improvements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>2.

Most (33 of 43 or 77%) participants were recruited from the University of California San Diego Medical Scientist Training Program (UCSD-MSTP); 10 of 43 (or 23%) had graduated from M.D./Ph.D. programs and were UCSD physicians/junior faculty at UCSD.

Effect sizes were calculated a priori using the G*Power software (Faul et al. 2007), and reported as Hedges&#8217; g values that correct for the upward bias that can occur in Cohen&#8217;s d when estimating effect sizes from small samples [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].

Intervention</title><p>The intervention was delivered via Zoom with group mindfulness peer mentoring sessions always led by two psychological health faculty as coach mentors, who did not know the participants prior to intervention. The rationale for the intervention was based on Kaplan&#8217;s ART [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] that integrates the dynamics of recovery and stress within the real-world contexts of work and leisure, hence, the intervention program encompassed teaching skills that have real-world applications. In each session, the coaches conducted mindfulness exercises and led an interactive discussion on health, well-being, resilience, leadership training, and self-compassion as these topics relate to real life. For example, coaches taught that all activities or daily actions offer opportunities to be in practice by bringing awareness to them, e.g., &#8216;washing dishes meditation&#8217; and informal practice in our daily life by bringing mindful awareness to whatever we may be doing in any given moment.</p><p><bold>Coaching Logistics:</bold> For the coaching sessions, participants were divided into sub-groups by career stage: pre-clinical MSTP students, MSTP graduate students, or clinician/junior faculty, so that there was an equivalent number of participants of 4&#8211;8 per sub-group allowing for adequate interaction time between participants, and also so that participants could easily connect with each other&#8217;s challenges given they were all in the same career-stage in a coaching session, making for more cohesive sessions where everyone felt similarly engaged. The coaches led three sessions (each 1.5 hours) spread over one academic quarter for each sub-group. The group meetings were held virtually to maximize accessibility and comfort for the participants and were scheduled per the participants&#8217; mutual time preferences. Participants were asked to turn on their videos for the duration of the sessions and to share personal opinions and life experiences. In these sessions, the primary goal for the coaches was to listen attentively and promote well-being. They also aimed to validate and acknowledge challenges that participants faced as physician-scientists in training or as early career faculty. Different mindfulness tools and perspectives were suggested and discussed by the facilitators and by the participants themselves to address work-life challenges. The participants were encouraged to share their sources of support (e.g., exploring sources of strength, stress management techniques, and spending time with loved ones). Brief self-compassion exercise was offered and taught at each session such as soothing and supportive touch [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], and walking meditation modeled after the description provided in &#8216;<italic toggle="yes">Wherever You Go There You Are</italic>&#8217; [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The participants also discussed potential changes to the physician-scientist environment that would facilitate well-being, if implemented. At the end of each session participants were encouraged to have a tool or thought that was discussed and resonated with them, and to prepare to share one at the next session.</p><p><bold>Practices and Activities:</bold> We opened and closed each session with a practice that we encouraged participants to integrate in their daily lives. These practices built from simpler, basic foundational practices to more complex forms that required engaging interaction, and all selected practices had much utility in real life &#8211; both work and leisure activities. These included (1) Practices for starting and facilitating meetings; (2) Mindfulness and Self-Compassion; (3) Sharing Sources of Inspiration; (4) Sources of Strength Reflection; (5) Goal-setting; (6) Skills in humanistic communication and emotional regulation; (7) Tools for building connection with self; (8) Tools for fear management; and (9) Moral Injury, locus of control and ways to respond.

We discussed setting ground rules for this communication and healthy boundaries for maintenance of confidentiality. We encouraged developing mechanisms for people to share their ideas and concerns anonymously so that there is no fear of retaliation or concern for power inequities.

This involves paying attention on purpose to the cycle of walking, of shifting, lifting and placing, as well as the sensation of walking on the soles of the feet, in particular, and walking with or without a destination (a walk to a patient, a walk in the lab) and then standing and paying attention to breathing, and the shifting of balance rooted as a tree with roots beneath one&#8217;s feet spreading beneath the &#8220;ground&#8221; below. We discussed these as grounding exercises and ways to remain anchored yet be flexible throughout the training as a physician-scientist and beyond into the years as a faculty member.</p></list-item></list><p>More informal practices were also shared based on the challenges and issues that the participants brought up. Self-compassion and self-kindness (extending compassion to oneself in moments of perceived inadequacy, self-criticism, external or internal feedback, failure, or general suffering) were discussed. To prepare to apply compassion and kindness to ourselves, we first identified a deep wise part within ourselves, the part which offers perspective. We practiced strengthening that part and sending ourselves kindness and compassion after reflecting on and bringing to mind a moment of challenge, and called forth how we may offer this kindness and support to a friend and directed this same support and kindness to ourselves. The practice <italic toggle="yes">Soften, Soothe, Allow</italic> was then practiced as a form of mindful awareness of emotion expressed in the body [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. By applying body awareness in moments where we experience a difficult emotion, we may note a release in intensity, and connect body and mind &#8211; allowing the emotion to be noted and held by cultivating non-judgmental awareness and soothing the places of discomfort with gentle or soothing touch.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(3)</label><p>Sharing Sources of Inspiration: We invited participants to bring and share inspirational quotes, teachings, and music which have nourished them over the years.

We taught ways to identify sources of strength &#8211; the things and practices that helped them feel connected and supported [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], and remain aware of these sources of strength and nourishment in times of challenge. Sources of strength may include music, reading, time with family, faith, dance, sports, etc. The practice of writing a &#8216;Sources of Strength Prescription&#8217; can be practiced for self or others. It begins with identifying those activities and practices that help us stay connected with our deepest self and to practice them. We discussed that often in times of stress and illness, we let go of these practices just when we need them the most. Most of us go in our &#8216;heads&#8217; into survival mode. Although we have learned how to survive and these survival behaviors have helped us in the past, often when stress or illness present themselves, over time, this survival attitude can disserve us. Learning to stay connected with and practice our sources of strength, in an ongoing way, and especially in times of stress was explored with participants. Each participant was asked to share how they might practice their sources of strength in their current life in a realistic fashion.</p></list-item></list><p>For a number of participants, time with and support from family and friends as well as time in nature were important to them. We discussed the concepts of &#8216;family of origin&#8217; and &#8216;family of choice&#8217;. In relation to nature, we talked about not only looking at and walking among the trees or by the sea, but actually practicing, for a moment, &#8216;being the tree&#8217; or &#8216;being the flower.&#8217; A traditional practice was also shared, of once a day, going outside, into nature, and &#8216;pouring out our heart&#8217; and the rest of the day, practicing living life fully and &#8216;being in joy.&#8217; We also discussed &#8216;awe pauses&#8217;, stopping for a moment, in the middle of a busy day, to pause and look at a tree, a photo of a child or grandchild, or listening to or singing a favorite song, to connect with a sense of wonder.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(5)</label><p>Goal-setting: We addressed several tools for goal-setting, including a goal-setting activity in which one responds both what they seek for themselves and for the world [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].

We encouraged the practice of self-aware communication and deep listening in the learning and sharing space of the sessions; here, we encouraged each person to recognize what they may be feeling and integrate this into their interpersonal interactions.

We discussed the concept of locus of control and that ultimately, we had control over one thing &#8211; our attitude towards the event [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The concept of fierce compassion was introduced as a way to take a stand for what is called for to navigate change [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. At the same time, we need to offer ourselves compassion while raising our hand to stop an unjust action encountered in the system, when these actions are not in alignment with the values that may have brought us to pursue a career as a physician-scientist. We also addressed the possible risks of such behaviors. Additionally, we discussed <italic toggle="yes">Social Tai-Chi</italic>, a practice of centering oneself and then choosing the next move, forward, back to the side, as we work toward a shared attention or goal, and discussed moving from being a passive ally to a becoming an active co-conspirator in the fight for justice [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].</p></list-item></list><p>Overall, we encouraged participants to identify practices that were nourishing to them and to modify and embrace them in a way that would allow them to integrate them into their daily lives. We encouraged participants to continue these practices in their daily lives in an ongoing and realistic way and to develop gentle reminders for themselves to continue to use them, e.g., a sticker on their computer, or a message on their phone. After the first session, participants shared some ongoing examples of bringing some of these practices into their workplace, during time with their children, and when opening the door to see a patient.

Iso-luminant colors were ensured using luminosity measurements in Photoshop. Luminance values for iso-luminant stimuli were 128, estimated as 0.30*R&#8201;+&#8201;0.59*G&#8201;+&#8201;0.11*B (where RGB are the Red/Green/Blue values of the chosen stimulus color).

Response windows were adapted on congruent trials in a 3up-1down scheme (-33&#8201;ms after correct trials and +100&#8201;ms after incorrect trials) and incongruent trial response windows matched that of the previous congruent trial. The fish flanking the middle fish interfere with the discrimination of the direction of the middle fish (left/right), hence, the task assesses interference processing.

<underline>Working Memory</underline>: Participants accessed a game-like task, <italic toggle="yes">Lost Star</italic>, which was based on the visuo-spatial Sternberg task [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Post-fixation cue on each trial, participants viewed a spatially distributed test array of objects (i.e., a set of blue stars) for 1&#8201;sec. Participants were required to maintain the locations of these stars for a 3&#8201;sec delay period utilizing their working memory. A probe object (a single green star of 1&#8201;sec duration) was then presented in either the same spot as one of the original test stars, or in a different spot than any of the original test stars. The participant was instructed to respond whether the probe star had the same or different location as one of the test stars. 50% of task trials had the same probe star location as one of the test stars while 50% had different location, and presented in shuffled order. For each participant, we implemented this task at the threshold perceptual span, which was defined by the number of test star objects that the individual could correctly encode without any working memory delay. For this, a brief perceptual thresholding period preceded the main working memory task, allowing for equivalent perceptual load to be investigated across participants [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. During thresholding, the set size of test stars increased progressively from 1&#8722;8 stars based on accurate performance where 100% accuracy led to an increment in set size;<bold>&#8201;</bold>&lt;&#8201;100% performance led to one 4-trial repeat of the same set size and any further inaccurate performance aborted the thresholding phase. The final set size at which 100% accuracy was obtained was designated as the individual&#8217;s perceptual threshold. Post-thresholding, the working memory task presented 48 trials over two blocks. Unlike the two previous tasks, this task was not speeded but instead adapted the working memory period in a 3up-1down scheme; if correct, the working memory period increased by +0.9&#8201;sec or if incorrect, it decreased by &#8722;0.3&#8201;sec. Both task item span and the length of the adapted working memory period were monitored as outcome measures.</p><p><bold>(2D)</bold>
<underline>Emotion Bias</underline>: Participants accessed the game-like assessment, <italic toggle="yes">Face Off</italic>, adapted from studies of attentional bias in emotional contexts [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] The task integrated a standardized set of culturally diverse faces from the NimStim database [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. We used an equivalent number of male and female faces, each face with four sets of emotions: neutral, positive (happy), negative (sad) or threatening (angry), presented on equivalent number of trials in each task block. Post-fixation cue on each trial, participants viewed an emotional face with a superimposed arrow of 300&#8201;ms duration. The arrow occurred in either the upper or lower central visual field on equal number of trials. Participants responded to the direction of the arrow (left/right) within an ensuing 1&#8201;sec response window. For neutral emotion trials, this response window adapted in a 3up-1down scheme (-33&#8201;ms after correct trials and +100&#8201;ms after incorrect trials). All other emotion trials followed the same response window as their previous neutral emotion trial. This task evaluates emotion bias (or interference) as the emotional faces interfere with the discrimination of the direction (left/right) of the arrow on which they are superimposed. Participants completed 144 trials presented over three equipartitioned blocks. Processing speed across trials was monitored as the main outcome.</p><p>Mapping of the intervention practices as they may influence the study outcomes is summarized in <xref rid="pone.0330290.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> below.</p><p>EEG data were collected in conjunction with all cognitive tasks using a 24-channel saline-soaked electrode cap with electrode locations as per the 10&#8211;20 system attached to a wireless SMARTING<sup>TM</sup> amplifier.

Neural assessment analysis.</title><p>Neural data were analyzed for cognitive task(s) that showed any significant intervention-related cognitive performance effects. A uniform processing pipeline was applied to EEG data based on the LSL event markers. Data were pre-processed for computing event related spectral perturbations (ERSP) and for source localization. Data pre-processing utilized the EEGLAB toolbox in MATLAB [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. EEG data were first resampled at 250 Hz and filtered in the 1&#8722;45 Hz range to exclude ultraslow DC drifts at &lt;1Hz and high-frequency noise produced by muscle movements and external electrical sources at &gt;45Hz. EEG data were average electrode referenced and epoched to stimulus onset based on the LSL timestamps, within the &#8722;1.0 to +1.0&#8201;sec event time window. The epoched data were then cleaned using the <italic toggle="yes">autorej</italic> function of EEGLAB, which automatically removes noisy trials (&gt;5sd outliers rejected over max 8 iterations). EEG data were further cleaned by excluding signals estimated to be originating from non-brain sources, such as electro-oculographic, electromyographic or unknown sources, using the Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. This algorithm localizes EEG data similar to low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>] with sparsity constraints applied to protect against false positives that are not biologically plausible. SBL yields source configurations from a few active regions, akin to independent component analysis, and are maximally independent from one another. Data from non-brain sources are removed to obtain clean subject-wise trial-averaged EEG. We verified that for cleaned data, channel peak activity in individual participant data did not exceed 3 mad from average channel activity across all subjects (total n&#8201;=&#8201;40).</p><p>For ERSP calculations, we performed time-frequency decomposition of the epoched data using the continuous wavelet transform (cwt) function in MATLAB&#8217;s signal processing toolbox.

Visual ROIs included left and right visual striate pericalcarine ROIs and extra-striate lingual, lateral occipital, cuneus and fusiform ROIs.

Discussion</title><p>This study investigated the outcomes of a brief quarter-long mindfulness intervention among M.D./Ph.D. trainees and graduates. Our goal was to enhance wellness in this cohort and address burnout. The program included three online group sessions with psychological health experts who provided mindfulness skills and led discussions on how to manage work-life challenges. We evaluated both self-report and neuro-cognitive outcomes of the intervention in a randomized waitlist-controlled study design. Overall, the brief intervention was very feasible to deliver with all participants completing the intervention. Self-report outcomes of mindfulness, self-compassion, well-being and burnout showed no significant change, but neuro-cognitive assessments demonstrated that selective attention processing speed was improved. EEG-based neural results suggested that the improvement in selective attention speed may be related to on-task visual alpha suppression &#8211; a neural marker for suppression of distractions [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>].</p><p>While the intervention had full participation and completion, reasons for not observing significant changes on self-report measures could be due to dosing/duration of the intervention or differences in style of the intervention compared to prior studies. For example, Krasner et al. (2009) implemented an 8-week intensive educational program (2.5 hours/week, 7-hour retreat) in mindfulness, communication, and self-awareness in primary care physicians. Pflugeisen et al., (2016) also implemented a mindfulness program in physicians over 8-weeks with weekly one-hour group teleconference coaching calls, weekly 5&#8211;7 minutes mindfulness training videos, and three 90-minutes in-person sessions. The intervention in our study had only three 90-minutes online group sessions over three months, and during the interim period participants were encouraged to continue their daily practice at home. Yet, notably, the feedback surveys from both groups that underwent the intervention suggested an overall positive experience with emergent themes of learning mindfulness, compassion, sense of community and attention to lifestyle factors. Of all the participants, 57% reported that they would engage in lifestyle behaviors that support well-being as a result of the intervention, which suggests long-term benefit that can be evaluated by future follow-up assessments.</p><p>We measured cognitive outcomes in the domains of selective attention, interference processing, working memory and emotion bias. These assessments were adaptive and with a threshold to maintain accuracy at ~80% so that ceiling effects would not occur with repeat administration. Cognitive outcomes showed a significant post- versus pre-intervention improvement in selective attention processing speed in the mindfulness intervention group, while the control group had a decrease in performance at their repeat session. Such intervention-driven modulation of visual attention is consistent with prior studies of meditation-based psychosocial intervention [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Digital meditation practice in young adults and children over a 6&#8211;8 week period have also shown improvement in selective attention skills [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]; in those studies, worse performance with repeat test administration without intervention could be associated with boredom or because the rejuvenating meditative intervention was not offered to the control group. The pattern of current findings fits with the energetic-resource model, which proposes that the state of resource depletion is reflected in the gradual decline of task performance speed over time [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Hence, we interpret the observed improvement in processing speed in the intervention group might be due the replenishment of attentional resources by the practice of mindfulness. We also note that although we evaluated a battery of cognitive measures, selective attention results survived multiple comparisons correction across all tests and had large bias corrected between group effect size (Hedges&#8217; g&#8201;=&#8201;1.13). Nonetheless, our small study sample urges the need for follow-up studies with larger sample sizes.</p><p>Our prior digital meditation studies also found improvements in interference processing and interoceptive attention, which were potentially not observed here due to differences in intervention dose and style [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Indeed, a review of cognitive effects of mindfulness trainings by Chiesa et al [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] concluded that cognitive functions show differential sensitivity to mindfulness-based interventions governed by varying factors in empirical studies, such as intervention study design, duration and participating populations. It should also be noted that the intervention in the current study incorporated a broader spectrum of tools beyond mindfulness, such as compassion, inspiration, strength reflection, goal-setting and fear management, among others.</p><p>At the neural level, visual alpha oscillations were suppressed at the post- relative to pre-session that maybe linked with changes in selective attention speed as shown by the negative correlation between these measures. Alpha band oscillations are considered a sensory suppression mechanism in visual selective attention [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. These studies have shown that sensory visual alpha suppression is controlled by top&#8211;down signals from frontoparietal attention networks. Thus, suppression of visual alpha band power following a stimulus is thought to measure attentional selection. Selective attention requires one to simultaneously attend to goal-relevant target stimuli while ignoring goal-irrelevant non-target stimuli. Alpha suppression for target stimuli (but not for non-targets) can facilitate selection. Post-stimulus visual processing usually also shows theta/alpha band ERS related to underlying spiking of visual sensory neurons [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], which is distinct from alpha suppression driven by top-down modulation. Here, we found that target stimuli had greater visual alpha suppression at the post-intervention session, suggesting improved attention selection. However, both groups at the group-average level showed this effect, which might be attributed to practice effects with repeat exposure in the control group. To investigate individual level effects, i.e., whether this plasticity in visual alpha may be relevant to change in selective attention performance speed, we performed a partial correlation controlling for group as a factor. We found a significant inverse correlation between improvement in selective attention processing speed and negative change in visual alpha. This result suggests that visual alpha suppression may underlie the individual-level improvement in cognitive performance. The relatively small effect size of the neural modulation suggests future studies need to replicate this outcome with larger sample sizes and using stronger intervention and control groups.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized, controlled study of a mindfulness-integrated intervention conducted with medical scientists and that assessed self-report measures alongside neuro-cognitive outcomes of selective attention, working memory, interference processing and emotional bias processing. However, this study has several limitations. Firstly, the study uses a passive (waitlist) control condition, which limited our ability to disentangle the treatment effects from non-specific effects, including demand characteristics, social desirability, placebo, expectation, motivation, and contact with the group members and leaders. This limitation is quite common in mindfulness studies and has been pointed out in several review papers [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. For example, Davidson and Kaszniak (2015) noted that unlike pharmacological interventions, implementing a double-blind placebo-controlled design in meditation-based interventions is nearly impossible because participants can easily discern if they are assigned to a meditation condition, making it quite challenging to keep them unaware of the nature of the intervention. Additionally, Tang et al (2015) pointed out that participants often join the intervention with expectation and intention that may also confound the effect of the actual program. Given tight resource constraints, we were unable to design and implement an active control group in the current study. The second major limitation of the study was the small sample size of 43 participants, especially when we evaluated several self-report and cognitive measures albeit with statistical corrections applied for multiple comparisons. The third limitation of the study was potentially having too small an intervention dose, although feasible within the busy schedules of medical scientists, to show any detectable improvements particularly apparent in the null self-report outcomes. We note that prior interventions conducted with physician cohorts have used larger intervention doses such as 8-week intensive education programs [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, overall, the present study can be viewed as a pilot for a future study with larger sample size, an active control group, and potentially greater dose, i.e., frequency and duration of mindfulness coaching sessions to produce robust outcomes.</p><p>In addition to the low sample size of the pilot study, we further acknowledge that our study participants had low burnout on average, which may explain some of the null findings especially for the self-report measures. It is also possible that heterogeneity in our cohort of M.D./Ph.D. trainees and graduates may have led to variability in outcomes and contributed to null results. Hence, future work may consider focusing on a high burnout cohort that is also uniform with regard to the training stage of study participants. Notably, prior work has also suggested that organization-directed workplace interventions could be effective for addressing burnout [<xref rid="pone.0330290.ref134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. The need for structural change was noted in the feedback survey by ~5% of our participants. Hence, future studies may explore how mindfulness-integrated interventions can be deployed at a larger scale within an organizational framework that seeks to enhance physician well-being.</p><p>In conclusion, this randomized, controlled study sought to examine the effects of a mindfulness-integrated psychological intervention on improvement of subjective well-being related behaviors, cognitive functioning and associated electrophysiological dynamics. The inclusion of EEG-based cognitive assessments is a strength of this study. Despite the low intensity training, we found significant improvements in selective attention in the intervention group; this cognitive plasticity was correlated with neural alpha suppression in visual cortex. Participants rated their intervention experience as very good, and a majority of participants planned to change their well-being related behaviors as a result of the intervention. Participants liked that the intervention focused on lifestyle factors, mindfulness and compassion, and that the study offered a sense of community. Based on these findings, we believe that a larger scale implementation of such an intervention applied with greater intensity and integrated within the education curriculum may be useful for increasing well-being among physician scientist trainees and graduates. Overall, we posit that the well-being of our physicians and physician scientist workforce should be a pro-active and vital component of training to reduce burnout in this community and mitigate its deleterious consequences for the healthcare system.</p></sec><sec id="sec018" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0330290.s001"

You lumped all of them under data analysis. Kindly titled them outcome measures. The use of repeated measure ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis tests were appropriate.</p><p>Response. We thank the Reviewer for their thoughtful comments regarding the statistical approach in our study. Following the Reviewer&#8217;s suggestions we have updated the &#8216;Data Analysis&#8217; section as &#8216;Outcome Measures and Data Analysis&#8217;. We have also allocated separate subsections for each outcome measures (Demographics, Self-report, Cognitive Assessment and Neural Assessment).</p><p>To address the Reviewer&#8217;s concerns regarding the demographic characteristics we would like to clarify that our study did not intend to find any association between categorical variables such as gender and ethnicity. Our decision to conduct Chi-square testing was simply to ensure that the two groups did not differ in either their distribution of gender or ethnicity. Since age was a non-categorical variable, we used the Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare age between groups.</p><p>We have further addressed the Reviewer&#8217;s concern by adding the following statements under the heading &#8216;Outcome Measures and Data Analysis&#8217;:</p><p>All the study measures were tested for normality using the Levene&#8217;s test. The normally distributed data were evaluated with parametric repeated measure analysis of variance (rm-ANOVA) for group x session interactions, while non-normal data were evaluated using the non-parametric equivalent of ANOVA, i.e., Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test (McKight &amp; Najab, 2010). For any significant ANOVA results, post-hoc analyses were conducted within each group using either paired t-tests for normal data or the non-parametric equivalent Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-normal data, and between-group effects in the ANOVA were further interrogated using either the two-sample t-test for normal data or otherwise the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed.</p><p>My major concern. This is an intervention study, but the results presented in Tables 2 and 3 do not show the intervention's true effect. Authors only presented pre-post for intervention and control groups, but the true effect size, which is a difference in difference, was not presented, making it difficult to determine the true effect of the intervention. That is the change in the intervention group minus the change in the control, including the corresponding confidence interval, would represent the true effect size, which is the difference in differences estimate.</p><p>Response. We thank the Reviewer for raising this concern. Following the Reviewer&#8217;s suggestion we have revised Tables 2 and 3 to show the confidence intervals and effect sizes based on the change in the intervention group minus the change in the control group.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript.

Extensive terms and quotes have also been streamlined.</p><p>I appreciate the authors&#8217; thoughtful engagement with this important topic and look forward to future developments in this line of work. Please see the attached comments.</p><p>Page 5&#8211;Line 8: What is BrainE? Please define this term clearly upon first use. If it refers to a proprietary tool or software, consider presenting it as: &#8220;we have validated the reliability of BrainE, a [brief description, e.g., cognitive assessment] platform,&#8221; rather than &#8220;the reliability of this BrainE platform.&#8221;</p><p>Response. We thank the Reviewer for their comment. In this revision we have described BrainE with greater clarity as below:</p><p>&#8220;here we implemented a scalable platform, the Brain Engagement (BrainE&#169;) tool, developed for free academic use by the Neural Engineering and Translation Labs (NEATLabs), for measuring core aspects of cognition. The BrainE&#169; tool delivers standard cognitive assessments synchronized with neural recordings using electroencephalography (EEG) (Balasubramani et al., 2021; Misra et al., 2018). We have validated the reliability of BrainE&#169; and shown its utility in measuring cognitive changes across the lifespan (Balasubramani, Diaz-Delgado, et al., 2022; Balasubramani, Walke, et al., 2022; G. Grennan et al., 2021, 2022; Mo et al., 2023; Ramanathan et al., 2024). We have also demonstrated its relevance in predicting mental health, well-being and burnout (G. K. Grennan et al., 2023; Kato et al., 2022; Nan et al., 2022, 2024; Shah et al., 2021).</p><p>3. 5&#8211;34: Using EEG measures is a large part of this study; could the authors clarify whether this constitutes a truly novel approach specifically in the context of interventions targeting health professionals? Even if it&#8217;s not the first study to use EEG measures in this capacity, the inclusion of imaging techniques is great.</p><p>Response. We thank the Reviewer for this comment, and have modified the text for greater clarity as below:</p><p>&#8220;EEG measures can provide insights into neural plasticity induced by the intervention (Anguera et al., 2013; Mishra et al., 2014, 2015, 2020, 2021), which has not been applied in the context of interventions for the healthcare community apart from a couple of recent studies (Jaiswal et al., 2024, White et al., 2024).&#8221;</p><p>4. 5&#8211;42: The acronym &#8220;MSTP&#8221; is defined only at the end; it would improve clarity to define it upon first use.</p><p>Response. We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. The MSTP acronym has now been defined upon its first use as &#8220;participants were recruited from the University of California San Diego Medical Scientist Training Program (UCSD-MSTP)&#8221;.</p><p>4. 7&#8211;Figure 1:</p><p>- What were the inclusion criteria for participants?</p><p>Response. We have stated the inclusion criteria in the revised manuscript, &#8220;Inclusion criteria were current enrollment in the UCSD MSTP program or graduates of MD-PhD program.&#8221;</p><p>- Consider whether this figure is the most effective use of space. Much of the information is redundant with the adjacent text or could be simplified. For example, listing the allocation group along with the number who did not receive the intervention may be unnecessary when the box is already labeled &#8220;Allocation to Waitlist Control Group (n = X).&#8221; It may be more useful to detail participant characteristics within each group (e.g., pre-clinical MSTP).</p><p>Response. We totally agree with the Reviewer&#8217;s comment. However, it was a mandatory requirement requested by the Journal&#8217;s editorial team to provide a Consort Flowchart as Figure 1.</p><p>- There appears to be a discrepancy: the figure indicates that 0 participants were excluded from analysis, but the text on line 6&#8211;23 states that some data were missing and excluded. Please clarify this inconsistency.</p><p>Response. After the enrollment stage, no participants were excluded from allocation and analysis stages. For transparency, we have explicitly detailed how many participants had their data missing on what measures in the manuscript text. To avoid confusion, we have deleted the following sentence, &#8220;Missing data were excluded from analyses.&#8221; The final number of participants in both groups represents correct number of participants whose data were analyzed.</p><p>Were there any subgroup differences?

No there were no subgroup differences.</p><p>That said, several aspects of the manuscript would benefit from further clarification and r</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0330290.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0330290.s005.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0330290.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0330290.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Steinborn</surname><given-names initials="MB">Michael B.</given-names></name><role>Section Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Michael B.

<bold>Comments to the Author</bold>
</p><p>1. If the authors have adequately addressed your comments raised in a previous round of review and you feel that this manuscript is now acceptable for publication, you may indicate that here to bypass the &#8220;Comments to the Author&#8221; section, enter your conflict of interest statement in the &#8220;Confidential to Editor&#8221; section, and submit your "Accept" recommendation.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;All comments have been addressed</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;(No Response)</p><p>**********</p><p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p><p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Yes</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>3. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Yes</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p><p>The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Yes</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p><p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Yes</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p><p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;All my previous comments have been duly addressed by the authors. They also provided further clarification where necessary.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Thank you for your thoughtful and comprehensive revisions in response to my initial feedback. I appreciate the care taken to clarify the intervention rationale, streamline terminology, and better define methodological components such as the use of EEG and participant grouping. The manuscript is now much clearer and more cohesive.</p><p>I have just a few remaining points for clarification or consideration before finalizing:</p><p>1. Table Mapping Practices to Outcomes</p><p>Thank you for elaborating on the rationale for not including a table linking mindfulness practices to targeted outcomes. I understand your concern regarding oversimplification, and the revised text provides helpful context. That said, even a brief summary figure or schematic&#8212;indicating general outcome domains (e.g., attention, emotion regulation)&#8212;might support reader understanding while preserving nuance.</p><p>2. Novelty of EEG Use</p><p>The inclusion of EEG-based cognitive assessments is a strength of this study. To further underscore the contribution, consider framing the novelty of this application more explicitly.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
