The underlying mechanism for this metabolic disorder has not been fully elucidated.

Ghrelin was administrated subcutaneously and in third ventricle (3V) to evaluate its effect on muscle wasting and hypothalamic molecules. Regulated AgRP expression by adenovirus vector approach and modulated hypothalamic JAK2/STAT3 activation by AG490 and colivelin injection were employed to study their role on muscle wasting. The effects of enteral nutrition (EN) on muscle wasting and hypothalamic molecules were also tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both peripheral and 3V ghrelin administration could decrease atrophy genes expression, increase hypothalamic growth hormone secretagogue receptor-1a and AgRP gene expression, and lower hypothalamic JAK2/STAT3 pathway activation in septic model rats. Inhibiting AgRP expression has little effect on atrophy genes expression and hypothalamic JAK2/STAT3 pathway activity in sepsis, but it would mitigate the protective effect of ghrelin on muscle wasting. Inhibiting hypothalamic JAK2/STAT3 pathway partially restored AgRP expression, reduced hypothalamic IL-1&#946; expression, and attenuated muscle wasting caused by sepsis. Of note, activate hypothalamic JAK2/STAT3 pathway evoked hypothalamic inflammation and neuropeptides alteration, as well as muscle wasting in sham subjects. Although AgRP over-expression could mitigate sepsis-induced muscle wasting, it has little effect on hypothalamic JAK2/STAT3 pathway activity and inflammation. EN could ameliorate sepsis-induced muscle wasting, but requiring AgRP expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Ghrelin could regulate sepsis-induced acute skeletal muscle wasting via hypothalamic JAK2/STAT3 and AgRP pathway.

Ghrelin or its analog supplement can ameliorate the cachexia status and increase body weight in cancer<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. But, its role in sepsis-induced acute muscle wasting has not been investigated. Study has shown peripheral interleukin-6 (IL-6), Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling were activated during muscle wasting<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, and hypothalamic IL-6 was involved in the fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. Yet, whether hypothalamic JAK2/STAT3 pathway was involved in the regulation of sepsis-induced muscle wasting was unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the central role of ghrelin in sepsis-induced muscle wasting.

Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery was performed to establish sepsis model in adult male Sprague&#8211;Dawley rats. Peripheral ghrelin was administrated subcutaneously every 12&#160;hours at a low (50&#160;&#956;g/kg) or high dose (100&#160;&#956;g/kg) until 48&#160;hours after CLP. Intraventricular ghrelin (5&#160;&#956;g in 5&#160;&#956;L), JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor AG490 (20&#160;nmol in 5 &#956;L), or agonist colivelin (20 pmol in 5 &#956;L) were administrated through third ventricle (3V) cannula immediately after CLP. Adeno-associated virus was used to inhibit or increase AgRP gene expression. For subject receiving EN, 2 mL peptison (Nutricia Co.) was administrated every 12 hour intragastrically after CLP. Each group with different treatment at least has eight subjects.

As shown, subjects displayed with obvious systemic inflammation and severe muscle wasting starting from 12&#160;hours after CLP (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a&#8211;d; Supplemental Digital Content Figure 1, available at: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/JS9/E444" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/JS9/E444</ext-link>). To test whether ghrelin could alleviate acute muscle wasting and explore the possible mechanism, we subcutaneously administrated ghrelin at a low (50 &#181;g/kg) and high (100 &#181;g/kg) dose in septic rats. Compared with CLP and low dose group, rats in high dose group showed lower atrophy genes expression (&#8722;37.0% and &#8722;31.5% for MuRF1, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01;&#160;&#8722;47.0% and &#8722;36.9% for MAFbx, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01), higher muscle fiber CSA (+21.6%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01;&#160;+13.6%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), as well as higher hypothalamic GHSR-1a (+67.0%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01), AgRP (+1.30 fold, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01) mRNA expression (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e&#8211;h).

Septic subjects receiving EN showed reduced atrophy genes expression (&#8722;24.1% and &#8722;18.4%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), increased muscle fiber CSA (+13.5%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), elevated ghrelin and IGF-1 level as well as increased hypothalamic GHSR-1a and AgRP expression (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a&#8211;f, Supplemental Digital Content Figure 6a&#8211;c, available at: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/JS9/E444" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/JS9/E444</ext-link>). However, in those subjects with AgRP downregulated, the reduction of atrophy genes expression and elevation of serum IGF-1 disappeared (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a&#8211;f, Supplemental Digital Content Figure 6a&#8211;c, available at: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/JS9/E444" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/JS9/E444</ext-link>). Therefore, EN could mitigate the acute skeletal muscle wasting induced by sepsis, probably through the ghrelin/AgRP central pathway (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g).<fig position="float" id="F3" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>EN mitigating sepsis-induced muscle wasting.

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This research highlights the central mechanism of ghrelin combating sepsis-induced acute muscle wasting. More interestingly, the protection of enteral feeding also related with the central effect of ghrelin.</p><p>Compared to other neuropeptides, AgRP expression displayed with a remarkable elevation after ghrelin administration. This may relate with intrinsic neuron GHSR-1a expression difference, given most of GHSR-1a was expressed in NPY/AgRP neurons<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Increased IGF-1 may account for the protective effect of ghrelin and AgRP. Our data shown serum IGF-1 was elevated after peripheral and central ghrelin treatment. Meanwhile, hypothalamic proinflammatory JAK2/STAT3 pathway was activated in sepsis and the muscle protection of ghrelin was accompanied with hypothalamic JAK2/STAT3 inhibition. This was in line with Katashima&#8217;s research which demonstrated the hypothalamic inflammation controlled fatty acid metabolism in the skeletal muscle<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. As shown, downregulation of AgRP has little effect on the activity of JAK2/STAT3 pathway in both sham and CLP group. On the contrary, inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 activation could alleviate the decrease of AgRP induced by sepsis. These results indicated AgRP were the downstream of this inflammatory pathway.</p><p>To our knowledge, for the first time we demonstrated EN alleviate skeletal muscle wasting through ghrelin/AgRP axis. This was supported by a previous research, which shown low-calorie EN could effectively increase ghrelin by reducing intestinal damage and suppressing POMC expression to ameliorate hypercatabolism<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. However, the exact responsible nutrient and optimal composition remains to be determined. This study was limited to the short duration of experiment and species difference when extrapolated to clinical contexts. Hence, future clinical research was required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study indicates that gastrointestinal hormone ghrelin can ameliorate sepsis-induced acute skeletal muscle wasting through hypothalamic JAK2/STAT3 and AgRP pathway.
