Despite significant advances in vaccine and antiviral development, the high mutability of human coronaviruses (HCoVs), such as SARS-CoV-2, presents a major challenge in treating these infections. Effective, broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are urgently needed to address both current and future HCoV outbreaks. Here, we conducted high-throughput screening of a natural product library containing 3407 compounds to identify potential antiviral agents against HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. We identified several natural products with inhibitory effects on HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and the SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.5) <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> without evident cytotoxicity. Among these, dibenzoylmethane (DBM) not only demonstrated broad-spectrum anticoronavirus activity <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> but also effectively inhibited HCoV-OC43 replication in a BALB/c mouse model. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that DBM, when administered orally, maintained effective concentrations in the blood over an extended period, suggesting its suitability for oral administration. Mechanistically, DBM was found to regulate caspase-6, a host factor that suppresses interferon signalling and promotes HCoV replication. These findings highlight DBM as a promising candidate for the development of therapeutics targeting HCoVs, offering potential for treating infections by both established and emerging HCoVs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>In this study, we investigated the potential of dibenzoylmethane (DBM), a natural compound, as a therapeutic agent against human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, as well as more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our findings demonstrate that DBM effectively inhibits viral replication and exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Through mechanistic analysis, we identified that DBM functions by modulating the host protein caspase-6, which is crucial for viral-induced suppression of the immune response. In animal models, DBM was shown to reduce viral replication without causing significant toxicity, highlighting its therapeutic potential. These results suggest that DBM could serve as a valuable candidate for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral treatments, particularly in response to emerging coronavirus infections. Our study underscores the promising role of natural products in antiviral drug discovery, offering a novel approach to combat viral diseases, especially in the context of rapidly evolving pathogens.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Key Research and Development Plan of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2024YFC2607300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Gengfu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>National Key Research and Development Plan of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2022YFC2303300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Leike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U22A20379</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Gengfu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>92169202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Shang</surname><given-names>Weijuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Major Project of Guangzhou National Laboratory</institution></funding-source><award-id>GZNL2024A01008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Gengfu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Hubei Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars</institution></funding-source><award-id>2022CFA099</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Leike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution>Key R&amp;D Program of Hubei Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>2021BCD004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Leike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Plan of China (2024YFC2607300 to GX, 2022YFC2303300 to LZ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (U22A20379 to GX, 92169202 to WS), the Major Project of Guangzhou National Laboratory (GZNL2024A01008 to GX), Hubei Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (2022CFA099 to LZ), the Key R&amp;D Program of Hubei Province (2021BCD004 to LZ).

Historically, several coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have caused significant public health crises. In addition to these more notorious viruses, other human coronaviruses, including HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, are common pathogens responsible for mild symptoms such as fever, rhinitis, pharyngitis, and abdominal discomfort [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, these viruses can also lead to severe acute respiratory infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitis, and may be life-threatening in immunocompromised individuals, including children, adults over 65 years of age, and patients with underlying conditions such as cardiopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and immunosuppression [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Notably, SARS- and MERS-like CoVs found in bat populations have demonstrated the ability to efficiently infect primary human airway cells [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], underscoring the potential for future cross-species transmission of CoVs.</p><p>Currently, effective treatments for coronavirus infections are limited, particularly given the high variability of these viruses. The efficacy of existing antiviral drugs and vaccines may be diminished or even rendered ineffective as the virus undergoes mutation [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 generated multiple variants that exhibited significant differences in transmissibility, pathogenicity, vaccine escape, and drug resistance [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this context, the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs is highly important.</p><p>One common approach for discovering antiviral compounds is high-throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast to the process of de novo drug development, drug repurposing presents numerous advantages, including a reduced timeline for development, sustained safety profiles, a lower incidence of adverse effects, and increased cost-effectiveness. These attributes render drug repurposing a promising strategy for discovering therapeutic options for both emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Natural products (NPs) encompass a vast array of biologically active compounds. Some NPs have been proven to be ideal reservoirs for repurposing against viral infection [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, most of these NPs have shown mild to modest effects, and very few of them have been investigated or found to be effective <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> with favourable pharmacokinetics and treatment routes.</p><p>In this study, we carried out high-throughput repurposing screening of a natural product library containing 3407 compounds to identify active antivirals against HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. In total, 5 NPs inhibited both OC43 and 229E <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> without obvious cytotoxicity. Among these compounds, DBM showed broad-spectrum anti-HCoV activity <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and potently suppressed HCoV-OC43 replication in BALB/c mice. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic and metabolic stability studies suggested that DBM is a safe and well-absorbed compound for oral treatment. Mechanistically, we found that DBM exerts anticoronavirus activity by regulating caspase-6, a host factor that suppresses interferon (IFN) signalling and facilitates coronavirus replication. Taken together, our results suggest that DBM is a potential candidate for combating HCoV infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Identification of hits through HTS that prevent cell death caused by coronavirus infections</title><p>HTS has become an indispensable tool in modern drug discovery, enabling the rapid evaluation of large compound libraries for potential therapeutic activity. By systematically testing thousands of compounds, HTS provides a powerful means to identify candidates with specific biological effects, including antiviral properties. In this study, we developed an HTS platform to evaluate the effectiveness of compounds that protect cells from cell death caused by two common human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. We screened a library of 3407 compounds from the Natural Product Library Plus (MedChemExpress, HY-L021P) with the CellCounting-Lite 2.0 Reagent (Vazyme, DD1101) to assess cell viability after inoculation with the viruses in the presence or absence of natural compounds from the library (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Through this screening, 20 natural compounds were identified to be able to protect cells during infection with HCoV-229E and/or HCoV-OC43 (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). We subsequently determined the 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values of the 20 valid compounds for inhibiting HCoV-229E in Huh-7 cells and HCoV-OC43 in RD cells by analysing the amount of viral RNA released by the infected cells. Furthermore, the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>) was assessed with the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, GlpBio), and compounds with high selectivity indices (SIs), including columbianadin, DBM, erythromycin estolate, ingenol 3,20-dibenzoate, and veratramine, were selected for further evaluation (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>).

A group of mice receiving menstruum orally quaque die (QD) was used as the control group. The other groups were treated with columbianadin at 50&#8201;mg/kg (mpk) QD, DBM at 400 mpk QD, erythromycin estolate at 300 mpk QD, veratramine at 10 mpk QD, ingenol 3,20-dibenzoate at 10 mpk QD, or VV116 at 25 mpk QD.

Moreover, the mice treated with DBM or VV116 did not experience weight loss during the experiment, indicating that DBM protected the mice from disease-related symptoms. The number of viral RNA copies from the brain, spinal cord, lungs, and kidneys were analysed via qRT-PCR, which targeted the HCoV-OC43 nucleocapsid gene sequence.

The Western blot results indicated that DBM-induced caspase-6 downregulation was not related to any of the aforementioned protein degradation pathways (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>). Moreover, we observed that in DBM-treated cells, the relative level of CASP6 mRNA was decreased starting at 12 hours after compound inoculation, which explained the terminal reduction in the level of the caspase-6 protein (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5H</xref>). Interestingly, for cells transfected with the caspase-6 expression plasmid with alternative promoter elements, the relative level of caspase-6 mRNA was also decreased by DBM treatment, which suggested that DBM may affect the mRNA stability of caspase-6 (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5I</xref>). Eventually, the decrease in the amount of caspase-6 mRNA and protein led to the decrease in the activity of caspase-6 in DBM-treated cells (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5J</xref>). To further validate the important role of caspase-6 in DBM-mediated antiviral mechanisms, we constructed a <italic toggle="yes">CASP6</italic> knockout RD cell line to evaluate the antiviral activity of DBM and Z-VEID-FMK, a peptidomimetic inhibitor that covalently binds to caspase-6.

Caspase-6, caspase-3 and caspase-7 are apoptosis-executing caspase, and we found that knockdown of CASP3 or CASP7 expression did not effectively inhibiting HCoV-OC43 replication (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1013492.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig</xref>).

Next, we evaluated the EC<sub>50</sub> values of virus strains passaged with or without DBM.

After infection, the cells were cultured overnight, and the quantities of viral nucleocapsid protein and caspase-6 were analysed by Western blot. The results indicated that both DBM and Z-VEID-FMK inhibited virus replication and that both activity inhibition and downregulation of caspase-6 inhibited coronavirus replication (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Although DBM demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral effects against a wide range of coronaviruses, namely, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and the SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.5), DBM exhibited no antiviral activity against other viruses, such as enterovirus EV71 (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>), which indicated that the antiviral mechanism of DBM may be related to certain unique mechanisms of coronavirus infection. When evaluating the inhibitory effect of DBM against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, the antiviral activity was found to be cell line-dependent. DBM demonstrated efficacy in HEK293T-AT cells, but not in Vero E6 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>).

On the basis of this finding, we hypothesized that DBM downregulates caspase-6, reduces the cleavage of nucleocapsid proteins, and thereby enhances IFN signalling to inhibit viral replication. To test this hypothesis, we incubated cells transfected with plasmids expressing coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins in the presence or absence of DBM or Z-VEID-FMK. To simulate the apoptotic environment typically found in coronavirus-infected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], staurosporine (STS), an apoptosis inducer known to activate caspase activity, was added to the culture medium. In the STS-treated groups, apoptosis was successfully induced, resulting in partial cleavage of caspase-6 (zymogen form, P33) to its active form (P18). In the DBM-treated groups, the levels of caspase-6 (P18) were significantly reduced, leading to a decrease in the cleavage of coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins. A similar reduction in cleaved nucleocapsid proteins was observed in the Z-VEID-FMK-treated groups, attributable to the inhibition of caspase-6 activity by Z-VEID-FMK. These results demonstrate that, compared to the control, DBM treatment downregulates caspase-6 and significantly reduces the levels of cleaved HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). As the reduction in cleaved nucleocapsid protein fragments could theoretically suppress IFN signalling, we sought to investigate the relationship between DBM treatment and IFN signalling. To this end, we further transfected cells with plasmids expressing both caspase-6 and coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins, and subsequently incubated the cells with or without DBM. Analysis of <italic toggle="yes">IFNB1</italic> and representative IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as <italic toggle="yes">IFIT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">IFITM3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">OAS1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">TRIM22</italic>, revealed that DBM reversed the suppression of IFN signalling by caspase-6 and nucleocapsid proteins (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.g006" ref-type="fig">Figs 6E</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1013492.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8B</xref>).

Furthermore, we examined the expression of <italic toggle="yes">IFNB1</italic> and its downstream IFN-stimulated genes following DBM treatment in the context of HCoV-OC43 infection (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8D</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1013492.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8E Fig</xref>). The results demonstrated that DBM treatment enhanced IFN signalling in HCoV-OC43-infected cells, leading to a significant upregulation of mRNA expression of <italic toggle="yes">IFNB1</italic> and associated ISGs. Additionally, the antiviral activity of DBM was markedly reduced when the cells were pretreated with ruxolitinib (a JAK1/2 inhibitor) or IFN alpha-IFNAR-IN-1 hydrochloride (an IFN-I and IFNAR inhibitor) (<xref rid="ppat.1013492.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

However, there are very few broad-spectrum anti-HCoV drugs and vaccines available for clinical use. The COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented international research effort on essentially all aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology, with high-efficacy vaccines and antivirals produced in record time. The worldwide efforts to combat SARS-CoV-2 have also accelerated studies of pancoronavirus inhibitors due to concerns about known HCoV infections and unknown zoonotic coronaviruses that may be transmitted to humans in the future. While most anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, such as remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir, can also inhibit other HCoVs, including OC43 and 229E, all of these approved inhibitors are DAAs. DAAs, while highly specific and potent, face significant limitations. They are prone to resistance due to viral mutations, have a narrow spectrum of activity, and may cause side effects in certain populations. In contrast, by targeting host cellular mechanisms, HTAs reduce the risk of resistance and can provide broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of new, broad-spectrum HTAs that target various sites in currently circulating and future emerging HCoVs to prepare for future outbreaks of yet unknown HCoVs.</p><p>Natural products are an enormous family of bioactive compounds derived from plants, animals, and microbes, and the most well-known pharmaceutical development of NPs is for anticancer or antiparasitic purposes, such as paclitaxel, ivermectin, and artemisinin [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In comparison, the contribution of NPs to the development of antivirals is less prominent. In this study, we conducted an HTS assay to simultaneously identify inhibitors of both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E from a natural product library. Through two rounds of cell-based screening, columbianidin, DBM, erythromycin estolate, veratramine, and ingenol-3,20-dibenzoate were highlighted due to their low cytotoxicity and high inhibitory activity <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. In suckling BALB/c mice, veratramine and ingenol 3,20-dibenzoate were highly toxic at doses as low as 10 mpk, possibly because of the neurotoxic effects of veratramine and the proinflammatory effects of ingenol-3,20-dibenzoate [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our preliminary <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> study indicated that, among the natural products tested, DBM was the only compound that effectively inhibited HCoV-OC43 replication in mice. Further animal studies revealed that oral treatment with 100&#8211;500&#8201;mg/kg DBM significantly suppressed OC43 viral loads in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, DBM attenuated inflammation in the central nervous system caused by viral infection. Furthermore, DBM treatment protected brain cells and reduced lung damage in HCoV-OC43-infected mice. Notably, a pharmacokinetic study in SD rats revealed high values for Cmax (4760&#8201;ng/ml) and T<sub>1/2</sub> (2.91&#8201;h) when DBM was administered orally, suggesting that DBM could represent a promising candidate for further exploration in antiviral drug development. This study is the first to demonstrate that DBM has anti-HCoV activity, in particular, a potent inhibitory effect against OC43 <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> with favourable pharmacokinetics.</p><p>DBM and its derivatives exhibit remarkable potential as multifunctional therapeutic agents, with preclinical evidence highlighting their efficacy in cancer prevention and treatment across diverse models. Their biological activities are underscored by potent cytotoxic effects against cancer cells, achieved through induction of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. For instance, the derivative DPBP demonstrates selective killing of melanoma cells (IC&#8325;&#8320;&#8201;=&#8201;6.25 &#956;g/mL) with a high selectivity index, while intercalating into DNA to disrupt its structure [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In vivo, dietary DBM profoundly inhibits mammary tumorigenesis in mice, reducing tumor incidence by 97% via suppression of cell proliferation and DNA adduct formation, and similarly arrests the cell cycle in prostate cancer cells at the G&#8321;/S phase [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Beyond oncology, DBM acts as a phase 2 enzyme inducer to promote carcinogen detoxification and exhibits antimutagenic properties by inhibiting DNA adduct formation. Notably, preclinical data support its safety, with no signs of hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity observed in treated animals [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These findings collectively position DBM derivatives as promising candidates for chemoprevention and therapy, particularly for skin, breast, and prostate cancers, though clinical translation requires further investigation into optimal formulations and long-term safety profiles.</p><p>The results of a series of cell-based assays proved that DBM inhibits HCoV-OC43 at the postentry and prebudding stages. LC-MS revealed that the expression levels of several host proteins were affected by DBM treatment. Some of the upregulated proteins, including SPRK1, STX12, and UQCRH, have been reported to be relevant to viral infection and replication [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The downregulated proteins were validated by siRNA knockdown. The reduction in caspase-6 expression inhibited viral replication in HEK293T cells, suggesting that caspase-6 is one of the host factors for OC43 propagation. The downregulation of caspase-6 was proven to be achieved at the mRNA level, as DBM treatment may decrease the quantity of CASP6 mRNA by impairing its stability. On the basis of this evidence, we believe that caspase-6 is the host factor downregulated by DBM during the antiviral process. The virus did not develop significant resistance after 17 consecutive passages in the presence of DBM. This finding suggested that DBM, as an HTA, is not susceptible to drug resistance.</p><p>Caspase-6 has been identified as an important host factor for influenza A virus (IAV), as caspase-6 deficiency increases susceptibility to IAV infection both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, as reported previously [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, in the case of coronaviruses, caspase-6 facilitates virus replication by inhibiting the host IFN signalling pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The inhibition of caspase-6, whether by decreasing the quantity or by inhibiting enzyme activity, can restrict coronavirus replication. In this study, we found that the downregulation of caspase-6 by DBM further decreased the amount of cleaved coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins, which were reported to be associated with IFN signalling suppression. After DBM treatment, the levels of intracellular <italic toggle="yes">IFNB1</italic> and downstream IFN-stimulated genes were elevated, which could explain why DBM does not function well in IFN signalling-deficient cells or in the presence of IFN signalling suppressants. Given that coronaviruses possess a distinct mechanism for inhibiting IFN signalling, caspase-6 inhibitors have been shown to exhibit antiviral activity against a range of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43 [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, in addition to the antiviral activity against HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and the SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.5) demonstrated in this study, we hypothesise that DBM may also possess broad-spectrum antiviral effects against other coronaviruses. Moreover, caspase-6 has been implicated in a range of non-viral diseases, with dysregulated caspase-6 activity linked to conditions such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, Huntington&#8217;s disease, and preeclampsia [<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1013492.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this study, DBM was identified as a potent inhibitor of caspase-6, suggesting its potential therapeutic application could be extended to the treatment of these diseases.</p><p>In summary, we identified a series of active compounds from a natural product library through HTS that effectively inhibited HCoV-OC43 or HCoV-229E. Among them, DBM was demonstrated to broadly inhibit HCoVs, including OC43, 229E, and SARS-CoV-2 variants, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, we found that oral treatment with DBM potently inhibited HCoV-OC43 in suckling mice, with the desired pharmacokinetics confirmed in SD rats. Mechanistic studies revealed that the DBM inhibits HCoV-OC43 infection by downregulating the expression of caspase-6, a host factor that facilitates coronavirus replication through the inhibition of the IFN signalling pathway, and that DBM also prevents the cleavage of viral nucleocapsid proteins to suppress the expression of <italic toggle="yes">IFNB1</italic> and IFN-stimulated genes.

Pregnant mice with the same expected delivery date were acclimated in individually ventilated cages under standard conditions within an SPF environment. Food and water were available ad libitum. The mice were anaesthetized by isoflurane inhalation before any operation that may have caused potential discomfort. Before the experiment, suckling mice were randomly allocated into 6 distinct groups, namely, the healthy group, the vehicle group, the groups receiving DBM at 500&#8201;mg/kg (mpk) orally quaque die (QD), 200 mpk QD, and 100 mpk QD, and the group receiving VV116 at 25 mpk orally QD. Each group was comprised of 5&#8211;6 suckling mice. On the initiation day (Day 0) of the experiment, 5&#8211;6-day-old BALB/c suckling mice were intranasally infected with 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>4</sup> TCID50 of HCoV-OC43. Two hours postinoculation, the mice were orally treated with either a placebo or varying doses of the drugs on the basis of their respective groupings as outlined earlier. This oral treatment regimen was continued for several days. The body weight changes of the mice were monitored daily. On Day 5, all the mice in each group were sacrificed for virological and histopathological analyses. Various organs and tissues, such as the brain, spinal cord, lungs, and kidneys, were collected from the mice on ice. Portions of the organs and tissues were homogenized with DMEM and subsequently centrifuged at 3000&#8201;rpm for 10&#8201;min at 4 &#176;C. Viral and host RNA from the organs and tissues were extracted and analysed as described above. For histologic examination, mouse organs and tissues were promptly collected after euthanasia and preserved in 4% paraformaldehyde for more than 5 days. The tissues were subsequently embedded in 3.5-mm paraffin. Fixed tissue samples were subjected to haematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) and immunofluorescence staining to detect the HCoV-OC43 antigen with anti-HCoV-OC43 nucleocapsid protein rabbit serum (ABclonal).

After entering the host cells, DBM can reduce the production of N protein cleavage products by down-regulating the load of caspase-6 protein at the mRNA level, which antagonises the natural immunosuppression dominated by coronavirus N protein and caspase-6.
