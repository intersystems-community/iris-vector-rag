</p></notes></front><body><sec id="inr70104-sec-0060"><label>1</label><title>Background</title><p>Nurses are crucial members of healthcare systems worldwide with significant potential to influence population health outcomes. Nursing has transitioned from a vocational profession to an academic discipline with increasing emphasis on global health impacts (Collins and Hewer&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The globalization of healthcare has resulted in the expansion of nursing education frameworks to align with global health priorities and equip nurses with the competencies required to address emerging global health challenges, including communicable and noncommunicable diseases, population mobility, and health systems disparities (Frenk et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The origins of international nursing collaboration date back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when global health organizations and nursing associations began forming networks to address public health crises and workforce shortages. The establishment of the International Council of Nurses (ICN) in 1899 marked a pivotal moment in the formalization of global nursing efforts, fostering international dialogue and setting professional standards for the profession (ICN&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). The push for advancing nursing and nursing education gained traction with the World Health Organization (WHO) and its global campaigns, such as the Nursing Now Campaign, to elevate nursing as a cornerstone of healthcare systems (WHO&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>).</p><p>Within academic settings, nursing schools established dedicated global offices and initiatives to address students&#8217; global health competencies, promote global health research, and advance nursing's involvement in health policymaking (Garner et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Gimbel et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Initiatives to develop global nursing offices (GNOs) occurred within the context of wider university mandates to internationalize, leading to increased diversity of university members, enhanced cross&#8208;cultural competence of faculty and students, and better prepared graduates who could tackle the challenges of a globalized world (Nguyen et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>). Canadian universities have played a long&#8208;standing and influential role in international nursing development and global health. One notable example is the collaboration between McMaster University and the Aga Khan University (AKU), where McMaster supported the development of AKU's nursing diploma and baccalaureate programs (McMaster University&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). The Canadian Association of Schools of Nursing has similarly advanced international efforts through its work accrediting nursing programs in countries without established accreditation frameworks, ensuring quality standards, and supporting the development of nursing education globally (Canadian Association of Schools of Nursing&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Ethical concerns also emerged in relation to equity and the risks of unequal benefits where more privileged institutions in higher&#8208;income countries would benefit from partnerships at the expense of less&#8208;resourced academic institutions in middle&#8208; and low&#8208;income countries (LMICs) (Alyafei and Malkawi&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>; Amisi et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Luthuli et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>; Yarmoshuk et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The ways that nursing initiatives foster global academic partnerships and the influence of these initiatives are less explored and are the objectives of this case study.</p><p>Through partnerships with global institutions, Canadian nursing programs have shaped education policies, strengthened workforce capacity, contributed to health initiatives, and promoted knowledge exchange. Among the academic nursing leaders in Canada at the forefront of these efforts, the Faculty of Nursing (FoN) at the University of Alberta (UoA) stands out. Through its International Nursing Centre (INC), which later became the GNO, the FoN has championed initiatives that strengthen nursing education, promote international research collaboration, and reduce barriers to global engagement. By positioning itself as a hub for global nursing scholarship, the GNO has helped shape international education, policy, and practice. This paper aims to examine the historical trajectory of this office with a focus on how progress was made toward advancing nursing education and the global health agenda.</p></sec><sec id="inr70104-sec-0070"><label>2</label><title>Sources of Evidence</title><p>A historical document analysis was used to examine internal records, institutional documents (including internal faculty newsletters and committee agendas), and reports to capture the evolving role in international collaborations and policy engagement of the FoN between the 1970s and 2020s. Document analysis is a systematic procedure for reviewing or evaluating documents to elicit meaning and develop empirical knowledge (Bowen&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). We adhered to the READ framework (ready materials, extract data, analyze data, and distill findings), which emphasizes rigor and transparency in document analysis (Dalglish et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Document selection was comprehensive and included any document in the digital and analog file collections of the GNO that referenced international partnerships, visiting scholars, or global initiatives (such as student exchanges, research projects, short&#8208;term programs, and curriculum development) in the GNO. A total of 13,000 documents were reviewed, and the list of documents cited in this case study is referenced in Table&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The historical document analysis approach used for this case study had some limitations, such as gaps in the available records which were not formally archived, potential biases in source material, and potential misinterpretation due to lack of context. Documents often reflected the perspectives of those in leadership or administration in the office at a given time, which might differ from the perspectives of students or academic visitors from other countries.</p><p>To supplement the document analysis, we conducted in&#8208;depth interviews with one previous director and three prior associate deans of the GNO to corroborate and enhance contextual understanding of key findings from the document analysis. The four GNO leaders had been faculty members in the FoN and were known for their leadership in international activities. These interviewees were purposely selected to add insights on major projects and milestones in the GNO. Data saturation was not sought, as this was a focused historical case study, but key events, decisions, and achievements were corroborated via the interviews. Two interviewers, a doctoral student (AH) and a doctoral prepared researcher (JS), with qualitative research training, completed the interviews. Interviewees were retired or previous colleagues of JS but had not previously met AH. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Alberta Research Ethics Board (Pro00139597_CLS1) prior to the interviews, and written informed consent was provided by the four participants. Interviews lasted one to two hours on average and were transcribed verbatim. A narrative analysis with a constructivist lens was used to add insights to the existing historical timelines and events drawn from the document analysis. Two participants read the final historical report and provided feedback to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness. One of the co&#8208;authors (PP) had also been in the FoN for an extended period of time and was able to provide contextual insights for many of the documents obtained during the document analysis.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="inr70104-tbl-0001" content-type="TABLE" orientation="portrait"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Reference List of Historical Documents.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><thead><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">In&#8208;text citation</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Name of document</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Projects, initiatives, and partnerships: An overview of the International Nursing Centre&#8208;Report July 1, 2001&#8211;June 30, 2005</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GNO digital folders</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strategic plan, GNO Digital Repository, 1996, SP&#8208;1996&#8208;01</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GNO digital folders</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Faculty of Nursing, Acting Dean report: Council meeting minutes, 1982 (acc#96&#8208;61, box 1, file 9)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">UoA archives</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Council meeting: Report on graduate education and research development, 1983 (acc# 96&#8208;66, box 1, file 12)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">UoA archives</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GNO historical report, Digital Repository, 1995, IR&#8208;1995&#8208;04</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GNO digital folders</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strategic plan, GNO Digital Repository, 1998, SP&#8208;1998&#8208;02</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GNO digital folders</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Memorandum of Understanding file, GNO Digital Repository, 1998, MOU&#8208;2015&#8208;03</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GNO digital folders</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Faculty travel log, GNO Digital Repository, 2007, FTL&#8208;2011&#8208;04</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GNO digital folders</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Faculty of Nursing, GNO and PAHO/WHO Collaborating Centre council reports 2010&#8211;2019</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GNO analog folders</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) Project final report, GNO Digital Repository, 2005, CIDA&#8208;2005&#8208;9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GNO digital folders</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strategic plan, GNO Digital Repository, 2001, SP&#8208;2001&#8208;04</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GNO digital folders</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Faculty of Nursing, 2002a, Spring, International Nursing Centre creates valuable linkages.

In its earliest phase, international activities were initiated by faculty members who independently pursued collaborations abroad. These efforts focused on conducting research, developing nursing education, consulting with international nongovernmental and governmental bodies, and supporting the small number of international students admitted to the UoA in the 1980s and early 1990s. Though decentralized, these early initiatives established a foundation of global responsibility that gradually became embedded in the faculty's culture, mirroring internationalization trends seen in nursing education globally (Garner et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Gimbel et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). As global health concepts evolved, so did the faculty's language and framing from using the term &#8220;international&#8221; to &#8220;global,&#8221; recognizing that health inequities transcend geographic boundaries and exist in both local and international contexts. This reframing reflected socially accountable and inclusive educational models of the time (Allen and Ogilvie&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and helped expand the scope of global health to include underserved populations within Canada, emphasizing that global health is relevant in all settings.</p><sec id="inr70104-sec-0090"><label>3.1</label><title>1970s: Foundations of Global Engagement</title><p>In the early 1970s, long before formal institutional structures were established for internationalization, individual faculty members took part in global work through WHO consultancies, curriculum development in Iran and Thailand, and advising nursing leadership in Malawi, Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, and Pakistan (1). These efforts included primary healthcare workshops and educator training programs (2). Some faculty members continued contributing internationally post&#8208;retirement, teaching nursing in Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh (2). This period reflects the initial shift from isolated individual efforts to a shared culture of global nursing responsibility embedded in the faculty's ethos.</p></sec><sec id="inr70104-sec-0100"><label>3.2</label><title>1980s: Early Institutional Steps</title><p>The 1980s marked a significant transition from individual&#8208;led initiatives to faculty&#8208;supported internationalization. In 1981, faculty members presented research at international conferences (3). In 1982&#8211;1983, foundational institutional visits and collaborations with American universities began, involving research collaboration on nontraditional healing, biological sciences, and gerontology (4). A notable early milestone came in 1986, when the faculty hosted the second International Nursing Research Conference, attracting 800 nurses from 38 countries. Through targeted fundraising, 13 nurses from LMICs were able to attend, demonstrating an early commitment to equity in global knowledge exchange (2). This decade laid the groundwork for the structured and strategic global initiatives that would emerge in the 1990s.</p></sec><sec id="inr70104-sec-0110"><label>3.3</label><title>1990s: Foundations of Internationalization</title><p>During the early 1990s, internationalization gained momentum across Canadian universities, including the UoA (Ogilvie et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Additionally, the first PhD program in nursing in Canada was initiated at the UoA in 1991, which was an important milestone that led to an increase in the number of international students over time. Students from countries like Chile, Pakistan, Ghana, and Iran began enrolling in the graduate nursing program (5). Partnerships in Latin America, Africa, and Asia were strengthened with a focus on nursing curriculum development and primary healthcare (1). In 1993, the FoN led the teaching of the UoA's first interdisciplinary undergraduate course on international health (taught by other faculties since the late 1980s), and in 1994, the FoN launched the First International Day, aimed at raising awareness about global nursing issues for Canadian nursing students (1). By 1996, a key planning document, <italic toggle="yes">The Internationalization of the Faculty of Nursing</italic>, laid out three major strategic goals: Capacity&#8208;building, research collaboration, and student global exposure (6). The INC was formally established in 1998, and the FoN signed multiple memorandum of understanding (MOU) with universities across Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas with partnerships spanning 14 countries (7).</p></sec><sec id="inr70104-sec-0120"><label>3.4</label><title>2000s: Strengthening Infrastructure and Expanding Global Networks</title><p>The INC supported a surge of partnerships, faculty mobility programs, and academic visitor exchanges across Brazil, Ghana, Mexico, and Thailand, often co&#8208;teaching and co&#8208;developing curricula (8). In 2002, a major institutional milestone was reached when the FoN was designated a Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization Collaborating Centre (PAHO/WHO CC) in Nursing and Mental Health (9). A two&#8208;decade Ghana Partnership also began with the launch of a five&#8208;year agreement in 1999 between the UoA&#8211;FoN and the University of Ghana (UoG), funded by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and managed by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (Ogilvie et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The project aimed to establish a high&#8208;quality, sustainable Master's in Philosophy (MPhil) Nursing program at UoG. The UoA was selected as a partner due to long&#8208;standing professional and personal relationships between faculty at both universities. Close to 100 Ghanaian students would go on to visit the UoA for a short&#8208;term research training course as a requirement to completing their MPhil program. This initiative also set the foundation for the first and only doctoral nursing program in Ghana (10). Further, the INC collaborated with other FoN offices that were leading innovation in their areas, such as the International Institute for Qualitative Methodology (IIQM), founded in 1998, which became a global driver of methodological innovation (11). Hosting large international conferences and providing residencies to doctoral and postdoctoral scholars, the IIQM fostered a robust qualitative research ecosystem that complemented the FoN's global nursing agenda (12, 13).</p></sec><sec id="inr70104-sec-0130"><label>3.5</label><title>2010&#8211;2020: Strategic Expansion and Renaming as GNO</title><p>In March 2010, the INC was rebranded as the Global Nursing Office (GNO), a philosophical pivot emphasizing global responsibility within and beyond national boundaries (14). From 2011 to 2020, the GNO ran short&#8208;term exchange programs for undergraduate and graduate students from international universities (15). These 1&#8211;2&#8208;week experiences included seminars on Canadian healthcare, Indigenous health, ethics, simulation learning, and site visits to healthcare facilities. International visitors from 32 countries, totaling over 430 participants, engaged in academic exchanges with Ghana and Brazil, sending the largest student cohorts (16). The UoG remained a cornerstone partner, providing support for Canadian FoN students to complete clinical practicum placements in Ghana. Indigenous health equity also emerged as a focus area within the GNO via a community&#8208;based project in Guatemala that integrated cultural perspectives into healthcare improvement strategies (17). This era was marked by expanding to local initiatives with marginalized communities, extensive mentorship of academic visiting scholars, and a focus on integrating global health competencies into nursing education, with over 30 MOUs to facilitate international collaborations (18).</p></sec></sec><sec id="inr70104-sec-0140"><label>4</label><title>Notable Impacts and Lessons Learnt</title><sec id="inr70104-sec-0150"><label>4.1</label><title>Advancing Nursing Students&#8217; Global Health Competencies</title><p>Early calls for collaboration among nursing faculties to foster international partnerships emphasized curriculum development as a key mechanism for advancing the nursing profession (Allen and Ogilvie&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Sochan&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Curriculum development plays a pivotal role in helping nursing faculty build cross&#8208;cultural competencies, reflect critically on pedagogical practices, and enhance educational standards across diverse settings (Sochan&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). This was reflected in our conversations with prior GNO leaders: &#8220;We certainly learned that health is dealt with differently in different countries&#8230;. You have your eyes opened&#8221; (Professor &amp; Director, INC, 2005&#8211;2008) and &#8220;We had an amazing group of visitors from around the globe; their insights were invaluable. Their different approaches to nursing education prompted us to rethink our curriculum&#8221; (Professor &amp; Director, GNO, 1998&#8211;2000). The Ghana Partnership was notable for its early attention to bidirectional student exchange, which allowed Ghanaian students to participate in learning opportunities in Canada and Canadian students to visit Ghana. This reciprocity provided tailored learning objectives for students from both countries. Most global health programs prioritize the mobility of students from high&#8208;income countries to LMICs (Fruhstorfer et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>) with the goal of advancing students&#8217; global citizenship (Simpson et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Equally important is expanding opportunities for students from low&#8208;resource settings to engage in study and training in new practice environments. The FoN has hosted hundreds of short&#8208;term exchange students, predominantly from LMICs. A major limitation, particularly noted in the Ghana Partnership, was the inability of visiting students to participate in clinical placements in Canada due to nursing regulatory restrictions. In contrast, Canadian students were able to engage in clinical nursing practice in Ghana. This asymmetry has drawn criticism (Marfo and Urindwanayo&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) and raises concerns about unequal knowledge exchange and learning opportunities between LMICs and high&#8208;income countries. The financial and logistical demands of international exchanges, exacerbated by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, have spurred interest in virtual global health education within GNOs. Virtual exchange programs provide opportunities for students to learn about international health systems, engage in intercultural dialogue, and collaborate with peers across borders (Kumpula and Krumwiede&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; King et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Galan&#8208;Lominchar et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). While these innovations are promising, further research is needed to evaluate their effectiveness and sustainability.</p></sec><sec id="inr70104-sec-0160"><label>4.2</label><title>Advancing Nursing Research Capacities for Health Equity</title><p>The commitment to advancing nursing research expertise globally was exemplified in the long&#8208;standing partnership between the UoA and the UoG. This collaboration supported nursing graduate students to conduct research in Ghana, the development of a graduate nursing curriculum in Ghana, and the preparation of a new generation of Ghanaian nursing researchers and educators, with some becoming graduate students at the UoA. These efforts significantly advanced the nursing profession as most Ghanaian scholars returned to their home country to take on leadership roles within government, healthcare, and academia (Aziato et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Marfo and Urindwanayo&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Ogilvie et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>):

Key lessons from the Ghana Partnership for future GNOs are the need to attend to partnership goals, collaborative processes, and, most importantly, the contexts in each country that influence the partnership, including faculty expertise, finances, institutional resources, nursing regulation, and the cultural and social conditions external to academia.</p></sec><sec id="inr70104-sec-0170"><label>4.3</label><title>Attention to Sustainability: Navigating Ethics and Resource Constraints</title><p>Among the most impactful components of the FoN's global engagement was the emphasis on mutual capacity&#8208;building (Astle&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Mackavey et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Sustaining international partnerships depended on internal support within the FoN, support from the broader university community, such as the UoA International Office, and securing government and nongovernmental sources of funding:
<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>You need a commitment from the leaders in the Faculty to make this a success. There is some funding that you need to put towards long&#8208;term engagement. And I think the reciprocal relationship is very important. It can't be just one way&#8212;us using them. We also have to bring benefits to other countries. (Professor &amp; Associate Dean, GNO, 2016&#8211;2021)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Faculty members consistently reflected on the inherent complexities of international collaboration, including power imbalances, inequitable access to resources, and differing institutional capacities. Global health nursing initiatives must be grounded in ethical frameworks that prioritize equity, co&#8208;creation, and sustainability (Astle&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Gimbel et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Leffers and Mitchell&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). A proposed model for scaling nursing and midwifery international partnerships identifies foundational elements essential for success, which include cultural humility, mutual respect, a commitment to sustainable, reciprocal partnerships, and alignment with organizational priorities through integration with the institution's and professional associations&#8217; strategic priorities (Spies et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Despite changes in leadership and fluctuations in funding, the commitment of individual faculty members at the UoA played a central role in sustaining international priorities. Faculty members with strong international experience and training, many of whom completed doctoral research abroad or had extensive global volunteer work, led foundational initiatives:
<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>It was probably one of the happiest times of my life as an academic. I'm fluent in Spanish and worked in Colombia for four years. It really helped having traveled around and having the language to be able to set up partnerships. I focused on Latin America, that was my prime interest&#8230; I had wonderful opportunities to teach in Mexico City and I did that in Lima, Peru. I had a research project with colleagues in Chile&#8230; I was working with Bolivian colleagues. (Professor &amp; Director, INC, 2005&#8211;2008)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Administrative leaders, especially deans, played an instrumental role in the growth and innovation witnessed in the GNO. Their willingness to invest in international work and support faculty engagement was crucial to institutionalizing global initiatives and was described by prior GNO leaders as a critical component of success for the FoN's international progress:
<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>At the time we started applying for the project in Ghana, we had five volunteers on our faculty who had worked internationally. We had a lot of people with international experience to draw on &#8230; and we had a risk&#8208;taking dean for a period of 11 years. (Professor &amp; Director, GNO, 1998&#8211;2001)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>The UoA&#8211;GNO exemplar highlights the importance of long&#8208;term leadership planning and intentional capacity&#8208;building. While early faculty expertise may have emerged organically, current and future global engagement efforts require a more deliberate approach to faculty development. Preparing nurses to engage in global health policy, education, and research must be embedded in training programs and supported through structured modules and mentorship (Bellegarde&#8208;Armstrong and Potter&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>). Sustainability is particularly challenged when partnerships depend on a few individuals. However, when initiatives are intentional, reciprocal, and respectful, with equity at their core, and are scoped appropriately within specific themes, they are more likely to thrive (Gimbel et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). GNOs would benefit from developing collaboratively with their faculty's strategic plans in alignment with faculty priorities and resources. This can be followed with targeted partnerships that are fostered over time with attention to sustainability and capacity&#8208;building of both faculty and students.</p></sec></sec><sec id="inr70104-sec-0180"><label>5</label><title>Implications for Nursing and Global Health Policy</title><p>To meet the sustainable development goals, GNOs must strengthen international solidarity, partner with nurses worldwide, and contribute to policy development (Rosa et&#160;al.&#160;<xref rid="inr70104-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The UoA&#8211;GNO has grown in response to the faculty's vision, aligning with university priorities and addressing broader societal and nursing&#8208;related issues in Canada and beyond. Engaging in reflection and reviewing the history of nursing initiatives help nurses identify approaches that can be maximized for success in the future. Looking ahead, nursing schools must continue to build international partnerships while broadening their focus to tackle global health challenges such as conflict, climate change, and socioeconomic inequality. Key takeaways from this GNO's successful partnerships include: (1) commitments to reciprocity, where all partners benefit and contribute equitably; (2) building strong personal relationships as a foundation for institutional collaborations; and (3) securing required leadership support and resources.</p></sec><sec id="inr70104-sec-0190"><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>This historical case study of the GNO at the University of Alberta demonstrates how academic nursing leadership can serve as a catalyst for advancing global health, education, and policy over several decades. The GNO's trajectory, from faculty&#8208;led initiatives to an institutionalised structure with enduring international partnerships, highlights the importance of reciprocity, sustainability, and cultural humility in global collaboration. Its contributions to student learning, research capacity&#8208;building, and health equity illustrate the potential of GNOs to operationalise the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals within academia. By embedding global health into nursing education and practice, GNOs provide a model for other institutions seeking to strengthen the profession's role in addressing health inequities worldwide. Looking forward, sustained leadership support, ethical partnership models, and responsiveness to emerging global challenges such as climate change and conflict will be essential for ensuring that GNOs remain effective drivers of global nursing advancement.</p></sec><sec id="inr70104-sec-0200"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Study design: JS and PP.
