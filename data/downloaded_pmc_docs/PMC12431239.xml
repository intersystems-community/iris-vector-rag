Numerous factors involved in the precise regulation of the spermatogenesis, and any disruptions or alterations in these regulatory mechanisms can lead to spermatogenesis arrest, which may result in male infertility. Among these factors, genetic influences play essential role in regulating the process. This study aimed to identify genes that are differentially expressed in relation to spermatogenesis arrest. Testicular biopsy samples were collected from 22 non-obstructive azoospermic patients diagnosed with spermatogenesis arrest (cases) and nine obstructive azoospermic patients (controls). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on five samples from the 22 non-obstructive azoospermic patients and compared to previously published transcriptomic data from obstructive azoospermic patients, which served as the control group. Differential expression analysis of the RNA-seq data identified 1,915 differentially expressed genes, comprising 337 upregulated and 1,578 downregulated genes. Among these, several key candidate genes were identified for further analysis, including the upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">FOS, FOSB, RGS1, and CXCL8</italic>, as well as the downregulation of <italic toggle="yes">TNP2, SPRR2C, LINC02314, and C16orf78</italic>. RT-qPCR validation confirmed the RNA-seq findings for these genes in the tested samples. Subsequently, RT-qPCR was performed on the remaining 17 non-obstructive (n&#8201;=&#8201;17) and obstructive azoospermic samples (n&#8201;=&#8201;9) collected in this study. The results from these additional samples were consistent with the RNA-seq data, further supporting the findings. Using gene ontology (GO) analysis and published literature, we linked these genes with spermatogenesis arrest, identifying promising targets that could serve as potential biomarkers for this condition in the future.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019004</institution-id><institution>Deanship of Research, Jordan University of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022044. the funder had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, desigen to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>Deanship of Research at Jordan University of Science and Technology (Grant No. 2022044).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All RNA sequence files are available from the SRA database (BioProject accession number PRJNA1233842).

This condition affects approximately 1% of males worldwide and 10&#8211;15% of males experiencing infertility [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Azoospermia is classified into two primary types: obstructive azoospermia (OA) and non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). OA is caused by blockages in the vas deferens or seminal ducts, whereas NOA typically arises from disruptions in spermatogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Spermatogenesis is a highly synchronized, multi-phase process that leads to the formation of mature spermatozoa [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This process encompasses cell renewal, proliferation, differentiation, epigenomic remodeling, and a sequence of mitotic and meiotic divisions that produce millions of sperm in the testes [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Disruptions at any stage&#8212;whether spermatogonia, spermatocytes, or spermatids&#8212;can lead to spermatogenesis arrest (SA) and, consequently, male infertility [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Such disruptions may be influenced by genetic factors such as mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, and/or gene expression mediated by RNAs, including small RNAs and other non-coding RNAs, which are essential in the regulation of spermatogenesis and male infertility [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Recent advances in high-throughput transcriptome analysis have facilitated the discovery of numerous genes that influence semen quality and testicular histology [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These developments have improved our comprehension of the function of both coding and non-coding transcripts in spermatogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Research has demonstrated significant correlations between various RNAs and sperm motility, count, and, to a lesser extent, morphology [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, transcriptomic approaches have uncovered over 60,000 transcripts within the sperm transcriptome, including approximately 11,000 that exhibit differential expression between infertile and fertile men [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, there exists a considerable gap in high-throughput investigations that specifically examine the coding and non-coding transcriptomes in men with azoospermia, particularly those with spermatogenic arrest at the levels of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, or spermatids [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In spite of notable advancements in elucidating the genetic and epigenetic factors that contribute to male infertility, the exact molecular mechanisms that underlie various stages of spermatogenic arrest remain inadequately understood. The majority of current diagnostic assessments depend on histological evaluations and hormonal analyses, which fail to fully represent the intricate gene expression dynamics linked to testicular dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Consequently, thorough transcriptomic profiling&#8212;especially via RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)&#8212;presents a promising strategy for revealing molecular signatures associated with specific arrest stages in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). Such revelations are essential not only for enhancing our biological understanding of spermatogenesis but also for identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets specifically designed for NOA-related conditions.</p><p>This work utilized RNA-seq to investigate the transcriptomic profile and pinpoint differentially expressed transcripts in human testicular tissues from NOA patients at various stages of spermatogenic arrest, in comparison to control males with OA who exhibited normal testicular interstitial compartments. The findings of our results lay the groundwork for the identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers for various forms of male infertility. Additionally, our transcriptomic insights may aid in the identification of therapeutic targets for the future treatment of male infertility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Sample collection and processing</title><p>The study received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Jordan University of Science and Technology/King Abdullah University Hospital (Nr. 44/2022) and subsequently from the IRB at King Hussein Medical Center (Nr. 5/2022).

Zinc is vital for stabilizing the sperm mitochondrial sheath and chromatin [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and its deficiency has been correlated with reduced male fertility. <italic toggle="yes">TNP2</italic> interacts with zinc ions through arginine- and cystine-rich protamines, which assist in stabilizing protein structure and chromatin remodeling during spermatogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, elevated zinc levels can induce mitochondrial oxidative stress due to its pro-oxidant properties [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Genetic variations in the <italic toggle="yes">TNP2</italic> gene are associated with defects in sperm quality and quantity, potentially contributing to SA due to its critical role in chromatin condensation [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>In this work, we observed a notable decrease in <italic toggle="yes">TNP2</italic> expression within the SA group, aligning with earlier studies that indicate reduced <italic toggle="yes">TNP2</italic> levels in individuals diagnosed with NOA, including SA and Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS) [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Notably, while diminished <italic toggle="yes">TNP2</italic> expression is associated with impaired sperm quality, elevated <italic toggle="yes">TNP2</italic> expression has been linked to abnormal sperm morphology and teratozoospermia [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These findings underscore the importance of maintaining <italic toggle="yes">TNP2</italic> expression for optimal spermatogenesis and favorable fertility outcomes.</p><p>The progression of germ cells from the spermatogonial stage to the production of mature sperms is influenced by several pathways, including the MAPK pathway [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This pathway is essential in the regulation of spermatogenesis, as it facilitates the proliferation of Sertoli cells and spermatogonial germ cells, in addition to promoting germ cell growth and apoptosis.</p><p>In this study, we have identified <italic toggle="yes">FOS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FOSB</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CXCL8</italic> as significantly upregulated genes, all recognized as downstream targets of MAPKs and potentially implicated in SA. <italic toggle="yes">FOS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">FOSB</italic>, which are part of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, play a role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival via the MAPK pathway [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, our study observed elevated expression of <italic toggle="yes">FOS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">FOSB</italic> in the SA group, while a previous study reported a decrease in expression of these genes among infertile men [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This discrepancy may arise from differences in study design and sample characteristics. Our study included cases arrested at various spermatogenic stages, from spermatogonia to spermatids, whereas the previous study mainly focused on maturation arrest and SCOS cases [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Additionally, the previous study utilized immunohistochemistry to measure <italic toggle="yes">c-</italic>FOS protein expression without distinguishing between its phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms. Their findings showed predominantly negative expression in germ and somatic cells, with positive expression limited to type B spermatids [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In contrast, our study employed gene expression analysis, demonstrating elevated <italic toggle="yes">c-FOS</italic> expression in NOA cases compared to OA. These differences likely reflect variations in sample composition and methodology. The previous study included samples lacking germ cells, such as those from SCOS, and those with spermatid stage arrest. Whereas our study focused exclusively on SA cases, covering a spectrum from the spermatogonial to the spermatid stage. This distinction in sample types likely played a significant role in the observed variation in gene expression patterns.</p><p>The C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (<italic toggle="yes">CXCL8</italic>) gene encodes the interleukin-8 (IL-8), a chemokine protein, that is vital for the activation of the MAPK pathway. Chemokines, along with cytokines, are essential for facilitating intracellular communication, particularly in mediating inflammatory responses [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. IL-8is secreted by various immune cells, including mononuclear cells, T lymphocytes, and macrophages, as part of the body&#8217;s defense mechanism against infection. Its function involves binding to G-protein-coupled receptors, leading to the release of beta and gamma G-protein subunits that activate downstream pathways such as MAPK. Additionally, <italic toggle="yes">CXCL8</italic> contributes to microtubule cytoskeleton reorganization, thereby enhancing the migration of the immune cells [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our findings revealed that <italic toggle="yes">CXCL8</italic> was significantly overexpressed in the SA group compared to the FC group, consistent with previous studies linking elevated <italic toggle="yes">CXCL8</italic> expression with heightened production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive ROS levels induce DNA fragmentation in sperm, which hinders sperm functionality and contributes to male infertility [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These findings suggest that while <italic toggle="yes">CXCL8</italic> plays a protective role in immune activation and signaling pathways, its overexpression may negatively impact fertility through ROS-induced DNA damage.</p><p>In similar manner, the regulator of G protein signaling 1 (<italic toggle="yes">RGS1</italic>) gene exhibited elevated expression levels in the SA group. RGS1 belongs to the regulator of G-protein family and is crucial in modulating G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], which are vital for cellular responses to extracellular stimuli such as hormones and chemokines [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The RGS1 protein encoded is localized on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane and contains a specialized RGS domain. Although no direct evidence links <italic toggle="yes">RGS1</italic> to SA, its potential role in spermatogenesis has been proposed. Spermatogenesis involves a complex interaction of signaling pathways, including GPCR pathways, that are essential for the proper functioning of germ cells, Sertoli cells, and Leydig cells [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">RGS1</italic> facilitates the deactivation of G-proteins, a critical process for regulating GPCR-mediated actions [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A defect in <italic toggle="yes">RGS1</italic> could disrupt the GPCR pathway, consequently affecting processes governed by this pathway, including spermatogenesis. The <italic toggle="yes">RGS1</italic> gene&#8217;s involvement in GPCR signaling highlights its importance in regulating pathways that may be critical for spermatogenesis and male fertility.</p><p>The <italic toggle="yes">LINC02314</italic> gene, classified as a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), has been observed to be downregulated in patients with SA [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This gene is recognized for its role in regulating both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression, as well as its involvement in RNA and DNA binding. Despite direct evidence linking <italic toggle="yes">LINC02314</italic> to SA is limited, it is high expression in testicular tissues implies that it may influence key regulatory mechanisms, such as chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and post-transcriptional processing [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These processes are vital for proper chromatin condensation and spermatogenesis in germ cells.</p><p>A small proline-rich protein-2C (<italic toggle="yes">SPRR2C</italic>), a pseudogene product linked to the development of the cornified epithelial cell envelope (CE), has been detected in testicular tissue, indicating a potential role in testicular epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The CE serves as a protective barrier [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], while epithelial cells in the testis are essential for sperm maturation, storage, and preventing autoimmune responses [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Specifically, Sertoli cells, specialized epithelial cells located within the seminiferous tubules, provide structural and nutritional support to germ cells and regulate hormonal activity during spermatogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The presence of SPRR2C in testicular tissues indicates its possible involvement in maintaining the epithelial environment that is essential for spermatogenesis and the overall health of sperm.</p><p>The <italic toggle="yes">C16orf78</italic> gene, found to be downregulated in SA patients, is currently unannotated and has one known transcript. Its precise function remains unclear, however, transcriptome analyses indicate that its expression is predominantly restricted to testicular tissue among various human organs [<xref rid="pone.0332025.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This tissue- specific expression suggests a potential involvement in spermatogenesis or other testicular functions, necessitating additional research to clarify its exact role.</p><p>This study has several limitations. One important point is the small sample size used in the RNA-seq analysis (n&#8201;=&#8201;5 per group), which inherently reduces statistical power and increases the risk of false positives or negatives. This limitation arose from several unavoidable constraints, including the unavailability of informed consent from all biopsy patients, histopathological exclusions, and the need to preserve some biopsy material for IVF use.</p><p>Moreover, some samples failed RNA or cDNA quality control thresholds. To overcome these difficulties, we used RNA-seq as a discovery tool and complemented it with RT-qPCR validation in an expanded, independent cohort (n&#8201;=&#8201;22 SA, n&#8201;=&#8201;9 OA), which significantly strengthened the reliability of our findings. Another key limitation is the inconsistency in the sources of control samples: RNA-seq controls were obtained from a public dataset due to technical failure in local control RNA preparations, while RT-qPCR controls were locally sourced. This raises the possibility of ethnic or technical variability. We mitigated this by carefully selecting a public dataset with matched clinical features and sequencing protocols, and emphasized validation using local samples. Additionally, the RT-qPCR validation cohort was not stratified by arrest stage due to limited sample sizes, which may obscure stage-specific expression patterns. Nonetheless, we performed post hoc subgroup analyses of the validated genes across different SA stages (data are not shown), which revealed no statistically significant differences. The number of validated genes (eight in total) was also constrained by cDNA yield, especially in low-quality clinical samples, though we applied strict statistical (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 and log2FC&#8201;&gt;&#8201;&#177;2) and biological relevance criteria to prioritize gene selection. Another limitation is the absence of Y chromosome microdeletions screening prior to sample inclusion, which may confound transcriptomic results. Lastly, although efforts were made to harmonize sequencing conditions between in-house and public datasets, the risk of batch effects cannot be entirely ruled out.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the study successfully identified biologically relevant DEGs and dysregulated pathways (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">MAPK, p53, GPCR</italic>), using an integrative approach combining RNA-seq, RT-qPCR, and functional enrichment analyses. Notably, genes such as <italic toggle="yes">TNP2, CXCL8, FOS, FOSB,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">RGS1</italic> emerged as potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets. These findings lay important groundwork for future research into the molecular mechanisms of spermatogenic arrest and the development of clinically useful biomarkers or treatment strategies for non-obstructive azoospermia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec011"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our study emphasizes the potential involvement of certain genes in SA, either through direct effects on germ cells or by influencing the microenvironment, such as the function of Sertoli cells. RNA-seq analysis has revealed numerous genes potentially associated to this condition, including several that may serve as stage-specific markers of arrest. From this extensive dataset, the association of eight genes with SA was validated through qRT-PCR. Nevertheless, additional functional studies are essential to ascertain the precise roles of these genes and to deepen our understanding of their genetic contributions in the spermatogenesis process.</p></sec><sec id="sec012" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0332025.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Clinical Characteristics of Included Subjects.</title><p>Control samples with OA, n&#8201;=&#8201;9, Spermatogenic arrest (SA), n&#8201;=&#8201;22, Mean values were reported with their corresponding standard deviation of the mean (SD), Statistical significance was determined using a non-parametric Mann&#8211;Whitney U test, with a significance threshold set at P&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0332025.s001.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0332025.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Details of Control Samples from Published Datasets of Obstructive Azoospermic Males Following Vasectomy Reversal.</title><p>S2 Table provides comprehensive details regarding the control samples used in the comparison with our SA samples, including chromosomal analysis results, and diagnosis.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0332025.s002.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0332025.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Accession number of RNA-seq data.</title><p>S3 Table represents the BioProject accession number corresponding to our samples, together with the accession numbers of each sample.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0332025.s003.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0332025.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>qPCR Primer Sequences and Annealing Temperatures.</title><p>S4 Table shows the qPCR primers used to assess the expression levels of each gene.

Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English??&gt;</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Yes</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Summary of the Study</p><p>The authors conducted a comparative transcriptomic study to identify differentially expressed genes in non-obstructive azoospermic men with spermatogenesis arrest, compared to obstructive azoospermic (OA) men with normal spermatogenesis. They performed RNA sequencing on testicular tissue biopsies (n=5 SA, n=5 OA) and validated selected DEGs via RT-qPCR in an expanded sample cohort (n=22 SA, n=9 OA). They found 1,915 DEGs (337 upregulated, 1,578 downregulated), identifying eight key genes (FOS, TNP2, CXCL8) potentially involved in SA. Functional enrichment (GO and KEGG) analyses highlighted pathways such as MAPK signaling and p53 signaling as critical in spermatogenesis regulation.</p><p>Merits</p><p>&#8226; Novelty and Relevance: The study targets a significant clinical problem&#8212;male infertility due to spermatogenic arrest. By focusing on NOA with testicular histological staging, the authors address an underexplored but critical area.</p><p>&#8226; Methodological Rigor:</p><p>1. RNA-seq quality control, alignment (STAR), and statistical analysis (DESeq2, Benjamini-Hochberg) were correctly implemented.</p><p>2. External public datasets were used as OA controls due to RNA quality issues, which is a practical solution given sample constraints.</p><p>3. RT-qPCR validation across a broader sample base strengthens the findings.</p><p>&#8226; Comprehensive Bioinformatics Analysis: Functional annotations (GO/KEGG), PCA, volcano plots, and correlation matrices provide strong visual and statistical support for the findings.</p><p>&#8226; Data Accessibility: Raw sequencing data has been deposited in the SRA (BioProject PRJNA1233842), fulfilling PLOS ONE&#8217;s open data policies.</p><p>3. Limitations and Areas for Improvement</p><p>A. Major Concerns</p><p>1. Small Sample Size for RNA-Seq (n=5 SA): This is a serious limitation for robust differential expression analysis. Statistical power is restricted, potentially inflating false positives/negatives.</p><p>2. Control Sample Source Inconsistency: The OA samples used for RNA-seq were from a public dataset, while qPCR controls were locally collected. This raises concerns of ethnic variability, and technical heterogeneity despite efforts to align sequencing protocols. If authors do not have to do with this, then they should consider it as major limitation of their study.</p><p>3. Gene Selection Justification: The basis for selecting the eight genes (4 upregulated, 4 downregulated) is not fully justified biologically or statistically. Were these the top DEGs by p-value, fold-change, or literature relevance? A more systematic, data-driven method, like using adjusted p-value alongside biological relevance, would be stronger. Authors should discuss why they have emphasized on these genes leaving other significantly differentially expressed genes.</p><p>4. While RT-qPCR validation on 17 more SA samples is good, the lack of stratification by arrest stage in this cohort is a weakness. Genes might behave differently and express differently across these stages. If authors could not do to rectify this, then at least they should consider it as their limitation.</p><p>B. Minor Issues</p><p>1. Figures are not clear, may be due to submission related deformation. Figure and Table legends should be more descriptive to allow understanding without the main text.</p><p>2. The term &#8220;spermatogenesis arrest&#8221; is sometimes abbreviated as SA and sometimes written out&#8212;consistency is advised.</p><p>4. Suggestions for Improvement</p><p>1. Clarify statistical thresholds and gene selection: Mention precise thresholds for DEG selection (adjusted p-value, log2FC) and how the final eight genes were shortlisted.</p><p>2. Discuss broader implications: Expand on how these candidate genes could be targeted or screened clinically, or how they relate to known pathways in spermatogenic regulation.</p><p>3. Line no 92 to 100: This part may not be required and seems to be irrelevant with the article. This portion can be omitted.</p><p>4. Materials and methods: Inclusion criteria regarding case sample selection should be more precise. Whether case patients were checked for Y chromosome microdeletion or not is to be confirmed. Y chromosome microdeletion is an important consideration as it can strongly influence the gene expression profile.</p><p>5. Quality of the figures should be enhanced.</p><p>Recommendation</p><p>Major Revision</p><p>The manuscript presents a well-executed and promising study on spermatogenesis arrest using transcriptomics. However, above mentioned issues are to be and must be addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;This is a technically sound and well-structured manuscript investigating the transcriptomic landscape of spermatogenesis arrest (SA) in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients. The use of high-throughput RNA-sequencing and validation by RT-qPCR on testicular tissue samples represents a valuable approach to better understand molecular mechanisms underlying male infertility.</p><p>The authors clearly define their objectives, and the methods are described in sufficient detail to allow reproducibility. The integration of bioinformatics analysis, including differential gene expression, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment, and PCA, is appropriate and strengthens the conclusions drawn. The results are consistent and well presented. The correlation between RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data is particularly convincing.</p><p>However, I have a few minor revisions to suggest:</p><p>Figures:</p><p>All figures currently lack descriptive titles or clear legends. Please provide informative captions for each figure, explaining what is shown, group comparisons, statistical indicators, and the meaning of colors or symbols used.</p><p>The quality of the figures is suboptimal. They appear blurry, which makes them difficult to interpret. Please upload high-resolution versions.</p><p>Supplementary Material:</p><p>Ensure that all supplementary tables referenced in the text (e.g., Table S1, S2, S3, S4) are available and properly labeled in the submission package.</p><p>Clarify the use of control data:</p><p>Since RNA-seq control samples were obtained from previously published datasets, please clearly state any differences in data acquisition or batch effects that may have occurred and how they were addressed in the analysis.</p><p>Gene validation rationale:</p><p>While the selection of top up/down-regulated genes is valid, a brief explanation for choosing these specific genes for RT-qPCR (e.g., biological relevance, novelty, expression intensity) would enhance clarity.</p><p>English Language and Formatting:</p><p>The manuscript is generally well written. However, a minor revision by a native English speaker or language editor would help improve fluency and consistency.</p><p>For example, correct terms like &#8220;SPRR2C, a pseudogene&#8221; &#8594; &#8220;a small proline-rich protein-2C, a pseudogene product involved in...&#8221;, or revise redundant phrases for conciseness.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>The discussion is comprehensive and rich in references. However, a brief paragraph summarizing the clinical implications of the findings (e.g., potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets) at the end would strengthen the conclusion.</p><p>Overall, this is a solid and promising manuscript that contributes new insights to the understanding of testicular transcriptomics in male infertility. I recommend minor revision before acceptance.</p><p>**********</p><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ext-link-type="uri">what does this mean?</ext-link> ).
