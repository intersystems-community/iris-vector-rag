Subsequently, biomedical knowledge, medical practice, health systems, and related industries will be changed. This change will ultimately lay the foundation for the new generation of medicine or high-performance medicine, so-called personalized medicine. The results of this renovation are already emerging at five levels: knowledge level, patient level, therapist level, health system level, and industry level. A national roadmap is the right way to shape the future in a conscious, effective, and preconceived way.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we provide a roadmap to expand systems biology approach in Iran, which can serve as a model for other countries with similar resources and strategic situation. We begin with field studies to map the current situation in the field and potential promoters and deterrents. We then identify key players and evaluate their power and benefit from expansion of systems biology approach. Finally, we provide strategies, key action areas, and feasible actions, as well as achievable goals and realistic vision and mission in a 10-year timeline, all in light of guidance from experts and pioneers in the field of systems biology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified the strategic position of Iran at WO area, which means the need to focus on conservative strategies to minimize the weaknesses leveraging opportunities.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of our suggestive 10-year roadmap will enhance the current situation of Iran in systems biology field to be the pioneer in west asia and a major player in the world.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Big data</italic></kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">bioinformatics</italic></kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">holism</italic></kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">integration</italic></kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">systems biology</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>

These cells, whether part of single-celled organisms or multicellular systems with billions of cells, contain molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and metabolites. In advanced living systems, these cells organize into tissues and organs that function collectively for survival. Biological complexity is evident across all these levels, from intracellular responses to the coordinated growth of entire organisms.</p><p>The study of living systems has fascinated philosophers and scientists for centuries. Advances in molecular biology, chemistry, and physics have transformed this curiosity into systematic exploration, particularly after the sequencing of the human genome in 2001. This milestone marked a revolution, yet as our comprehension of cellular and molecular components and processes advances it also highlights the challenges of understanding the intricate interplay among molecular and cellular components. While molecular biology, excelled at identifying these components, it struggled to connect them into cohesive networks and explain their collective behavior.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The past two decades have witnessed an explosion in high-throughput technologies, enabling the collection of vast biological datasets. These datasets encompass comprehensive views of cellular components such as the genome, proteome, and metabolome. Concurrently, the emergence of bioinformatics methods and tools has facilitated the analysis and integration of these datasets, fostering a more holistic understanding of biological systems.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>To address the complexity of living systems, two primary approaches are employed: the reductionist approach and systems thinking. Reductionism dissects systems into smaller components to understand their behavior, which has been pivotal in elucidating the chemical basis of numerous living processes. However, this approach falls short in addressing the emergent properties of highly complex biological systems. Systems thinking, by contrast, adopts a holistic perspective, integrating diverse information and examining interactions among components and with their environment.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Systems biology applies systems thinking to study the dynamic interactions within biological systems. It uses computational tools and mathematical models to analyze complex networks and regulatory mechanisms. This approach views diseases as imbalances within these networks and emphasizes restoring equilibrium through targeted interventions. Systems biology&#8217;s integrative nature holds transformative potential for fields such as pharmacology, biotechnology, and clinical research.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><sec><title>Systems biology: Definition and scope</title><p>The foundation of systems biology, known as systems thinking, is based on three main aspects of (i) recognizing all actors and stakeholders related to a system, (ii) determining communication networks among them, as well as (iii) gaining a quantitative and scalable understanding of the impact of these networks on each other and the environment.[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, the exact definition of systems biology, varies among researchers,[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] mainly due to differences in the definition of systems.[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>While some equate systems biology with bioinformatics, the former is broader.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Bioinformatics specializes in computational analysis of high-throughput data, whereas systems biology demands a holistic viewpoint and an interdisciplinary foundation.[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Therefore, although knowing bioinformatics tools and computational methods are necessary to enter this field of science, these are not equivalent to each other.</p><p>Systems biology can be viewed as an &#8220;umbrella&#8221; encompassing various &#8220;omics&#8221; disciplines, including genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, as well as their integration within cells, tissues, and organs.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This comprehensive approach ensures that researchers avoid the pitfall of focusing narrowly on a single omics layer.[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Instead, they analyze diverse networks and interactions across components, requiring expertise in biology, mathematics, biostatistics, informatics, and data science.</p><p>In another point of view, the definition of systems biology is based on the definition of its components. &#8220;Biology&#8221; is the study of living things and &#8220;system&#8221; is &#8220;a separate unit whose existence can be maintained through the interrelationships of its components.&#8221; By this point of view, it seems that conducting systems research requires the use of both reductionist and integrated approaches to be able to identify both the properties of components and their complex interactions. This finally determines how these components and their interactions lead to the permanence of this whole unit.[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>In a more applied view, systems biology means the analysis of the interaction of biological molecules and cells at the system level in both health and disease.[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] By fostering collaboration across disciplines, systems biology can reshape healthcare systems and drive innovation in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Integrating clinical perspectives with cutting-edge analytical technologies, interdisciplinary research can not only extend our understanding of biological systems but also improve disease diagnosis and treatment.[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This breadth is critical for tackling complex diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, which are characterized by intricate molecular and cellular imbalances.[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Systems biology seems to be a general scientific term which can be rephrased to make it more specific. Systems medicine is an example, which is the application of systems biology in medical concepts, research, and services. Systems medicine applies mathematical, statistical, and advanced modeling, aiming to identify complex networks that describe underlying mechanisms of diseases, the reasons for their progression and regression, how they respond to treatment, and how to reduce side effects of these treatments, alongside with methods to prevent their occurrence.[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Finally, Leroy Hood (the American scientist who first introduced the term systems biology) in 2009 defines systems biology as an attempt to provide a holistic view of biological science. The only possible way to understand the features of a system is to define its components, the interactions between them, and then look at how they change in response to stimuli. Employing this method, the first step is to define a model that can describe the system. Subsequently, by making changes in that system, various hypotheses are tested and examined to see whether the obtained results are in accordance with the desired model. Finally, although understanding of the system cannot be achieved all in once, models are developed that can gradually more and more accurately predict the behavior of a system.[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p></sec><sec><title>Systems biology: A paradigm-shift in biology?</title><p>The importance of the emergence of systems biology approach is such that some consider it as a paradigm shift in biology.[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The term &#8220;paradigm shift&#8221; refers to a psychological process that, by gradually transforming patterns and ideas, can eventually alter the way projects are done.[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Biology has undergone paradigm shifts at several points, the most important of which are the developments after Mendel and Darwin. Some do not see the emergence of systems biology as a shift in paradigm, but according to the definition provided, some consider it to be the latest conceptual evolution in biology.[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The emergence of this approach has undoubtedly fostered a new mindset among life scientists and has gradually altered patterns and concepts in perspectives and related research.</p></sec><sec><title>Challenges and opportunities</title><p>Despite its promise, systems biology faces significant challenges, particularly in data integration and analysis. The sheer volume, heterogeneity, and complexity of omics and clinical data exacerbate the &#8220;big data to knowledge&#8221; issue, requiring advanced computational models capable of simulating complex interactions while delivering accurate, reproducible results. Interoperability among datasets, standardization of data formats, and overcoming biases in datasets are persistent issues that hinder effective integration and generalizability.[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Another notable challenge lies in the translation of computational models into actionable insights. While theoretical frameworks and simulations are abundant, their validation in real-world experimental and clinical settings is often limited, delaying the application of systems biology findings in precision medicine and drug development. Furthermore, ethical concerns, including data privacy, informed consent, and equitable access to systems biology-driven healthcare innovations, present critical obstacles.</p><p>By addressing these challenges, systems biology can revolutionize biomedical research and healthcare. Its interdisciplinary nature not only advances scientific understanding but also bridges gaps between biology, engineering, and computational science. As the field matures, it will play a pivotal role in addressing global health challenges and driving the next wave of innovation in life sciences.[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p></sec><sec><title>Current state and future prospects</title><p>The rapid evolution of systems biology has created a growing market for its applications in personalized medicine, drug discovery, and biotechnology. For example, the global market for systems biology is expected to grow significantly as industries adopt omics technologies and integrate them with computational tools. Countries such as the United States, Germany, and Japan have established comprehensive systems biology initiatives, often backed by government funding and interdisciplinary consortia. These initiatives underscore the importance of aligning science and technology policies with market needs, promoting innovation through collaboration among academia, industry, and policymakers.</p><p>Iran&#8217;s roadmap for systems biology must draw inspiration from these global examples, prioritizing funding, infrastructure development, and workforce training. Establishing national centers of excellence, fostering international partnerships, and creating platforms for interdisciplinary research will be essential. Policymaking frameworks should focus on long-term sustainability, with policies that encourage public&#8211;private partnerships and provide incentives for research and development.</p><p>According to the urgent need to promote systems biology in the presence of upfront challenges, a systems biology roadmap is imperative. Designing such a roadmap will help to promote systems biology while appropriately handling the above challenges.</p><p>Designing and implementation of new projects requires continuous planning. A prerequisite for this is understanding the current situation by examining the internal and external factors affecting the projects. Strategists and analysts should identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats around field. Analyzing external factors will illuminate opportunities and threats. Based on these insights, as well as the internal strengths and weaknesses, goals, procedures, and policies are then determined. Strategic analysis, and strategy formulation and selection, are two important primary components of the strategic management process, which requires the identification and analysis of internal and external influencing factors. Here we provide a roadmap to promote systems biology in Iran and appropriately overcome current challenges, in the view of expert opinions and strategic analysts.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>First, we identified the current status, internal and external influencers (promoters and opponents), stakeholders, and strategic factors, using field studies including interviews with experts at different levels.

Experts in the factor weighting questionnaire expressed their views on the impact of each internal and external factor by choosing a decimal number between 0 and 1 (With 0 and 1 meaning the minimum and maximum effect of the factor on the development of systems biology approach, respectively). In the factor scoring questionnaire, the opinion of experts regarding the current situation of each internal and external factor in the country was assessed according to the Likert scale[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] with a numerical allocation between 0 and 4 (0 = very bad, 1 = bad, 2 = average, 3 = good, and 4 = very good).</p><p>The second questionnaire was designed to evaluate the stakeholders, based on their power and benefit upon the development of systems biology approach. Here, power means the current ability and level of authority of the stakeholders or the ability and level of authority imagined for them in the future to act to achieve the expected results of the project. The power of stakeholders can consist of legal-, financial-, or knowledge power. The profit and income that stakeholders will gain if the project goals are met, are considered as benefits. In this questionnaire, the experts expressed their views on the level of power and benefit of the stakeholders by specifying a number between 0 and 4 according to the Likert scale[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] (0 = very low, 1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high, and 4 = very high).</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation and analysis of strategic factors and stakeholders</title><p>After collecting questionnaires and receiving expert opinions, and to determine the strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities for each internal and external factor, the average opinions of respondents regarding the weight and score of each factor were calculated. In the internal factor analysis section, if the final score of each factor, i.e., the average score of the respondents, is &lt;2, that factor is considered as a weakness and if it is more than 2, the factor is considered as the country&#8217;s strength in developing the systems biology approach. In addition, if the total score, i.e., the average score of all internal factors is more than 2, it indicates that internal factors are strong in total, and if this score is &lt;2, it indicates the weakness of the country in developing this approach.</p><p>Similarly, in the external factor analysis section, if the final score of each factor, i.e., the average score of the respondents, is &lt;2, that factor is considered as a threat, and if more than 2 is calculated, the factor is considered as an opportunity to develop the systems biology approach. Furthermore, if the total score of external factors, i.e., the average score of all factors in this category is more than 2, it indicates that external factors are an opportunity to develop the systems biology approach, and if this score is less than 2, external factors are considered as a threat to the development of this approach.</p><p>These scores are eventually normalized according to the given weights as follows: First, weights of each internal or external category (strength/weakness/opportunity/threat) are summed up and each weight is divided by the summed value to give a normalized weight. Second, each score is multiplied by the normalized weight to give a normalized score. These scores are then used as the basis for defining country&#8217;s general strategic position in SWOT matrix.</p><p>The overall strategic position of Iran is then defined in SWOT matrix, by showing the average score of internal factors on x-axis, and the average score of external factors on y-axis, with 2 at the center of matrix (x = 2 and y = 2).</p><p>For evaluating the stakeholders, we used the power&#8211;benefit matrix to categorize them and identify the key actors. We chose this method for stakeholder analysis because of its ability to differentiate stakeholders based on the type of interaction with them. Henceforth in the next steps, appropriate strategies can be used to communicate with each of the stakeholders. Based on the two criteria of power and benefit, stakeholders were divided into four categories: key actors, founders, institutions, and the public.</p><p>All these helped to draw realistic vision and mission, aims, and indices for the purpose of this project.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats &#8211; Strategies, key areas, and actions</title><p>Among many techniques that can be used to analyze strategic cases, we used the SWOT matrix as a very popular approach.[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Developing macrostrategies and proposing strategic measures to develop the systems biology approach was based on the identified opportunities and threats, strengths and weaknesses, as well as the strategic position obtained. The information obtained from data analysis in the previous section was used as input at this stage to develop practical strategies. Analyzing the situation and determining the practical strategies constituted a strategic balance between the driving factors (including environmental opportunities and strengths) against the deterrents (environmental threats and weaknesses) and to eliminate them.</p><p>In SWOT analysis, four strategic positions emerge from the intersection of opportunities and threats with strengths and weaknesses:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Offensive position (SO)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reversible or conservative (WO) position</p></list-item><list-item><p>Diversity&#8211;competitive position (ST)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Defensive position (WT).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>We define the Iran&#8217;s general strategic situation and propose strategies in any of the above categories to maximize the opportunity of timely meeting the project goals in developing systems biology approach. In the SO area, opportunities should be taken advantage of by utilizing strengths to develop a systems biology approach. In the WO situation, we must take advantage of opportunities to minimize the country&#8217;s weaknesses in developing this approach. In the ST section, we should use the country&#8217;s strengths to avoid threats in developing a systems biology approach. Moreover, finally in the WT part, efforts should be made to minimize weaknesses and avoid potential threats in the development of a systems biology approach.</p><p>After drawing strategies, we identified key areas in which strategic actions need to take place and specified practical actions along each strategy, all in light of expert opinions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec

Since the overall strategic position of Iran falls within the WO range, the strategies defined in this range have higher priorities for implementation. Therefore, six strategies, namely WO1 to WO6 have been proposed as shown in <xref rid="jmss.jmss_66_24-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> to leverage opportunities to address weaknesses. For instance, the WO2 strategy has been proposed to cover the weaknesses W1, W9, and W10 by utilizing the opportunities O3 and O4. Furthermore, alongside the main WO strategies, strategies were defined for the other three positions, i.e., SO, ST, and WT, as shown in <xref rid="jmss.jmss_66_24-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, so that they can be used in defining actions if needed.</p><fig position="float" id="jmss.jmss_66_24-f003" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Defined strategies in each of the four strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats strategic situation categories</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="JMSS-15-26-g003.jpg"/></fig><p>In strategic planning, aligning strategies helps to establish a vision for the subject at hand.

The successful development of systems biology in the country requires participation and cooperation among various organizations and experts across biology, engineering, computational sciences, and other related disciplines.</p><p>This study marks a significant effort toward laying a foundation for systems biology development by adopting a structured and comprehensive approach. Initially, extensive analyses were conducted to examine the measures taken by leading countries, serving as a benchmark for best practices. The SWOT was then identified through expert input, providing critical insights into the nation&#8217;s potential to embrace this transformative field. These findings informed the formulation of a clear vision, mission, strategic goals, and practical measures to advance systems biology.</p><p>Despite the strengths highlighted in this study &#8211; such as access to talented and motivated personnel &#8211; there are several limitations worth discussing. The SWOT analysis, while a valuable tool, is inherently subjective and depends on the perspectives and experiences of the experts consulted. In addition, the lack of quantitative data to support certain identified factors limits the robustness of the conclusions. Future studies should aim to complement expert opinions with data-driven methodologies, such as bibliometric analyses and economic assessments, to better substantiate the identified SWOT.</p><p>The findings of this study have implications not only for advancing systems biology in Iran but also for guiding its implementation in resource-limited settings. The proposed roadmap emphasizes the need for strategic investments in education, infrastructure, and international collaboration, while also addressing the challenges of interdisciplinary training, data integration, and ethical considerations. However, significant barriers remain, including limited funding for large-scale initiatives, the need for cross-sector collaboration, and the potential resistance to change from traditional academic and research structures.</p><p>By addressing these barriers, this study could serve as a catalyst for systems biology development in the region, enabling innovative solutions to pressing health and environmental challenges. It underscores the importance of establishing a cohesive framework to guide stakeholders in building the necessary infrastructure, policies, and partnerships. The systematic approach described here could be adapted and scaled to similar contexts, further amplifying its global relevance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides a critical first step toward realizing the vision of systems biology development in Iran. It highlights both the immense potential of this interdisciplinary approach and the need for coordinated efforts to overcome implementation challenges. Future work should focus on refining the proposed strategies, fostering cross-disciplinary collaborations, and addressing gaps in infrastructure and policy to ensure the sustainable growth of systems biology in the country.</p><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This project was ordered and supported by the Biotechnology Development Council of the Vice-Presidency for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and in consultation with the Iranian Society of Systems Biology.
