Tubal pregnancy, accounting for over 95% of ectopic pregnancies, refers to the implantation of a fertilized ovum within the fallopian tube [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Under normal physiological conditions, the fertilized ovum traverses the fallopian tube and implants in the endometrial lining. However, in tubal pregnancies, impaired tubal function&#8212;caused by factors such as inflammation, adhesions, surgical history, or congenital anomalies&#8212;prevents the embryo from migrating to the uterus, resulting in ectopic implantation.</p><p>The incidence of tubal pregnancy has been rising globally, accounting for approximately 1&#8211;2% of all pregnancies [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a common obstetric emergency, untreated tubal pregnancies may lead to fallopian tube rupture, massive hemorrhage, and life-threatening complications [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Current treatment modalities include both conservative and surgical approaches, each associated with varying rates of subsequent intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) and recurrent ectopic pregnancy (REP) depending on the chosen intervention [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Treatment options for tubal pregnancy vary and include expectant management, methotrexate (MTX) therapy, salpingectomy, and salpingostomy. A prospective study demonstrated higher(OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.29&#8211;2.01) postoperative spontaneous pregnancy rates in patients undergoing salpingostomy compared to those who underwent salpingectomy [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], underscoring its advantage in preserving reproductive potential. Studies indicate that MTX treatment does not achieve a 100% success rate in hemodynamically stable EP patients [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similarly, salpingostomy carries a risk of retained trophoblastic tissue, which may necessitate adjuvant medical therapy or repeat surgical intervention [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. While growing attention has been directed toward reproductive outcomes in EP patients, particularly those desiring future fertility, treatment failure rates remain a critical concern due to their direct impact on patient recovery time and healthcare costs [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, <italic toggle="yes">it is important to clarify</italic> the failure rates associated with different treatment modalities for tubal pregnancy to guide optimal therapeutic decision-making.

For randomized controlled trials, we evaluated the quality of evidence for each outcome based on the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, publication bias, and imprecision. For observational studies, we evaluated the quality of evidence for each outcome based on effect size, dose-response relationship, and negative offset. The evaluation was performed independently by two researchers. In case of disagreements, a third reviewer was consulted to reach a consensus. The quality of evidence was classified into four levels: high, moderate, low, and very low. High-quality evidence was defined as evidence from RCTs (without factors that could cause the quality of evidence to be downgraded) or observational studies that were upgraded in quality by two levels. Moderate-quality evidence is defined as evidence from RCTs that were downgraded by one level or observational studies that were upgraded by one level. Low-quality evidence was defined as evidence from RCTs that were downgraded by two levels or observational studies. Very low-quality evidence is defined as evidence from RCTs that were downgraded by three levels, observational studies that were downgraded by one level, case series, and case reports [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>1.8 Ethical approval</title><p>All analyses were based on published studies and did not require ethical approval or patient consent.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec015"><title>2 Results</title><sec id="sec016"><title>2.1 Literature search process and characteristics of the studies</title><p>An initial search yielded 609 articles.

The confidence intervals did not include 0, indicating a significant difference in efficacy between the two treatments, with salpingostomy combined with methotrexate demonstrating greater effectiveness.

This approach is particularly vital for patients desiring fertility, especially those with contralateral tubal dysfunction or absence. Conversely, other studies reported no significant differences in intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) or repeat ectopic pregnancy (REP) rates between salpingostomy and methotrexate (MTX) therapy [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>MTX, a folate antagonist, terminates pregnancy by inhibiting cellular proliferation and disrupting trophoblastic cells. Single-dose MTX regimens are widely recognized as safe and effective for hemodynamically stable patients with early-diagnosed ectopic pregnancies [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>However, our analysis shows that in general, the failure rate of methotrexate (MTX) is higher than that of salpingostomy; while the subgroup analysis indicates that the failure rate of single-dose MTX treatment is higher than that of salpingostomy, and the failure rate of the double-dose MTX regimen does not show a significant difference compared to salpingostomy. These suggest that a single-dose intervention with methotrexate may be associated with a higher risk of treatment failure, while two doses administrations do not show a significant difference, indicating that in clinical practice, it may be necessary to optimize the methotrexate administration regimen (such as increasing the dose) to reduce the failure rate, but this needs further verification.</p><p>Our meta-analysis shows also that the failure rate of salpingostomy combined with methotrexate treatment for tubal pregnancy is significantly lower than that of simple salpingostomy. Through network meta-analysis, it is further confirmed that salpingostomy combined with MTX treatment is the most effective, and compared with methotrexate and simple salpingostomy, salpingostomy combined with MTX has a lower failure rate while preserving the function of the fallopian tube.</p><p>According to our meta-analysis results, when hemodynamics were stable, we observed that the levels of blood HCG on days 4 and 7 following the first treatment with methotrexate were unsatisfactory, that is, the decrease in blood HCG levels is less than 15%. If hemodynamics were still stable, we could inject methotrexate again to treat the tubal pregnancy.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that laparoscopic salpingostomy remains the most cost-effective approach. Multi-dose MTX is considered cost-effective only when serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentrations are below 3,000 IU/L, whereas single-dose MTX becomes cost-effective at hCG levels below 1,500 IU/L [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For patients with initial hCG levels between 1,500 and 3,000 IU/L, the costs of salpingostomy and MTX are comparable; however, MTX becomes more expensive when hCG levels exceed 3,000 IU/L [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) studies indicate that systemic methotrexate (MTX) therapy is linked to greater impairments in physical, role, and social functioning, as well as poorer health perception, increased pain, and higher rates of depression compared to surgical management [<xref rid="pone.0332169.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Though salpingostomy combined with MTX reduces failure rates, multimodal therapy may be result in more side effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>4 Strengths and limitations</title><p>A key strength of this study is the integration of conventional meta-analysis and network meta-analysis to evaluate treatment outcomes for tubal pregnancies. The inclusion of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) across diverse clinical settings enhances the generalizability of the findings to real-world scenarios. The pooled effects in standard meta-analyses demonstrated robust statistical power, and sensitivity analyses confirmed the stability of the results.</p><p>However, there are several limitations, including: 1. A limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) necessitates the conduct of higher-quality studies to strengthen the conclusions. 2. Small sample sizes in some of the included studies may potentially amplify publication bias.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec031"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>For hemodynamically stable patients with a desire for future fertility, salpingostomy combined with methotrexate is an excellent option for treating tubal pregnancy. This approach has a lower failure rate compared to either methotrexate or salpingostomy alone and appears to have minimal impact on the patient&#8217;s quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="sec032"

If the reviewer comments include a recommendation to cite specific previously published works, please review and evaluate these publications to determine whether they are relevant and should be cited. There is no requirement to cite these works unless the editor has indicated otherwise.&#160;</p><p>Additional Editor Comments:</p><p>This munuscript&#160;is quite interesting, but there are some issues that must be addressed.</p><p>First, regarding study inclusion, in addition to the factors already listed by the authors, geographic region and ethnicity are also critically important, as they directly impact treatment effectiveness.</p><p>Second, the figures and tables in the article suffer from inconsistent font styles and cluttered formatting, which need to be improved for better readability and presentation.</p><p>Third, in the Discussion section, much of the current content would be more appropriately placed in the Introduction. The discussion should instead focus on your findings and their interpretation.</p><p>Although the two reviewers did not raise many concerns, I still strongly recommend that this manuscript undergo thorough revision.</p><p>[Note: HTML markup is below.

Review Comments to the Author</p><p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;I thank the author for taking out time to carryout this very important piece of work.</p><p>There are few queries I would want the authors to adress</p><p>1. There are continuing concerns with recurrent ectopic pregnancy following salpingotomy/salpingostomy due to scarring. Kindly address this.</p><p>2. In selecting the works on medical management of tubal pregnancy, did you consider the size of the ectopic mass? If yes, what was the eligible maximum diameter for medical management. This is very important as this, in addition to the level of hCG, is a determinant of success rate.</p><p>3. Justify your use of decrease of less than 20% on days 4 &amp; 7 as your definition of failure of medical management. A change of &lt;15% between the day 4 and 7 values is widely used and we know that it is usual not to have a significant decrease or even an increase level on day 4 level following medical management.</p><p>4. You appear to interchange the use salpingotomy and salpingostomy eventhough they are different procedures. Can you rectify this please.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;While the manuscript generally reflects scientific research that supports its conclusions, some parts of the discussion&#8212;particularly those addressing quality of life and cost&#8212;lack accompanying data analysis.
