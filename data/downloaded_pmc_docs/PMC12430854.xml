Overall, the unmet need for mental health care is high across the globe in different socio-demographic and ethnic populations. There have been efforts to understand the barriers to reducing the treatment gap globally and in India. It is evident that in different populations and countries, there are variations in barriers to accessing mental health care. A systematic understanding of barriers and facilitators to accessing care would be the first step toward bridging the gap in mental healthcare needs. This systematic review seeks to identify the factors that either enable or hinder adolescents in accessing care for their mental health concerns in India.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology:</title><p>The electronic search was conducted in March 2023 on two databases: PubMed and Google Scholar. A detailed search strategy with relevant search terms was developed. The search yielded 1402 articles, which were further screened using inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 242 such articles were thus screened for abstract, of which 26 articles were screened for full paper, and finally, five articles were included in the review.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Barriers and facilitators to access to care are represented using the ecological model of behavior change. Facilitators at each level of this model help a person move closer to accessing health care, while barriers at each level take a person away from accessing health care. At the individual and interpersonal level, factors such as knowledge, awareness, and willingness to seek care, and treatment are predominant factors. At the institutional level, i.e., at the school level, awareness among teachers is an important facilitator, whereas stigma is a crucial community-level barrier to accessing health care. Most facilitators and barriers identified during this systematic review are related to policy-level issues such as quality of health care and Human Resource (availability, training, etc.), healthcare setup, Health Care Funding, etc.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Evidence for access to mental healthcare-related barriers and facilitators for adolescents in India is very scanty. More research is needed to understand these aspects from varying socio-cultural and demographic backgrounds.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Access to care</kwd><kwd>adolescents</kwd><kwd>barriers and facilitators</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>systematic review</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>Nil.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>B<sc>ACKGROUND</sc></title><p>Mental health issues among adolescents are a significant public health concern globally. One in seven aged 10&#8211;19 years has a mental disorder, accounting for 13% of the global disease burden in this age group. Depression, anxiety, and behavioral disorders are among the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Recent global epidemiological data state that up to 20% of children and adolescents have a mental illness and that up to 50% of all adult mental disorders have onset in adolescence.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Systematic review and meta-analysis of the global prevalence of unmet needs of mental health care among adolescents showed an overall pooled prevalence of 54% and 58.1% in adolescents with mental health disorders.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Even in India, the proportion of mental health disease burden among adolescents is too high. According to the National Mental Health Survey of India, the overall prevalence of any psychiatric morbidity among adolescents was 7.3%, with a similar distribution between males and females (M-7.5% and F-7.1%).[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, the prevalence of adolescent mental health morbidity reported among different studies in India varies significantly, ranging from 12.5%[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] to 33.3% (Malhotra and Patra, 2014).</p><p>Overall, the unmet need for mental health care is found to be high across the globe in different socio-demographic and ethnic populations.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] As per the WHO World Mental Health Survey, unmet needs for mental health treatment are pervasive and especially dire in underdeveloped countries.[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In India, this treatment gap ranged between 70 and 92% for different disorders: viz., common mental disorder &#8211; 85.0%; severe mental disorder &#8211; 73.6%; psychosis &#8211; 75.5%; bipolar affective disorder &#8211; 70.4%; alcohol use disorder &#8211; 86.3%; tobacco use &#8211; 91.8%. Even in high-income countries, the treatment gap in adolescents&#8217; mental health is high.[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>There have been efforts to understand the barriers to reducing the treatment gap globally and in India. Some of the globally reported barriers are financial burdens, competing life demands, difficulty navigating the healthcare system, childcare needs, stigma and low mental healthcare literacy,[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] language,[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] preference for self-management and stigma,[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] low perceived need for treatment, desire to handle the problem on one&#8217;s own,[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] stigma, low mental health resources.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Similarly, a policy document from India on mental healthcare unmet needs of adolescents states important barriers such as the shortage of mental health professionals, low capacity and motivation of non-specialist health workers to provide quality mental health services to young people, and the stigma.[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A study conducted in Dehradun among the adult population found that perceived negative social attitudes, lack of physical accessibility, and lack of information are the critical barriers limiting their access to care.[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, there is a lack of synthesis of these factors to assess their roles as a barrier in given socio-demographic contexts and find out how they can be addressed more systematically rather than stand alone.</p><p>It is evident that in different populations and countries, there are variations in barriers to accessing mental health care. Overall, global evidence suggests that barriers and challenges to accessing mental health care are contextual and vary from socio-demographic and socio-cultural background. A systematic understanding of barriers and thereby facilitators to accessing care would be thus the first step toward bridging the gap in mental healthcare needs. Collective information about barriers and facilitators would help identify areas of focus and intervention at various levels such as policy, societal, family, and organizational and individual levels.</p><p>The socio-ecological model was used to categorize the barriers and facilitators to adolescent mental healthcare access because it allows for a comprehensive understanding of how factors at multiple levels&#8212;individual, interpersonal, community, organizational, and policy&#8212;interact to influence access. This model is particularly useful in addressing the complex and interconnected nature of mental healthcare access, recognizing that barriers and facilitators operate within broader social and environmental contexts that vary across different populations and regions.</p><p>Hence, the current systematic review seeks to identify the factors that either enable or hinder adolescents in accessing the care they need for their mental health concerns. By gaining insights into the facilitators and barriers to access to health care, the review can provide valuable insights for developing strategies and policies to improve access to care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec><title>Database</title><p>The electronic search was conducted in March 2023 on two databases: PubMed and Google Scholar.

The socio-ecological model helps to understand how barriers and facilitators interact at various layers of the environment&#8212;from individual-level factors like personal beliefs to policy-level influences like government funding. This framework ensures a holistic understanding of the multifaceted nature of mental healthcare access for adolescents.</p><p>The following <xref rid="ijcm.ijcm_307_24-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> represents the conceptual framework of these barriers and facilitators concerning various levels of the ecological behavior change model.</p><fig position="float" id="ijcm.ijcm_307_24-F1" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Facilitators and barriers to access to mental health care in adolescents from an ecological model of health behavior perspective</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="IJCM-50-22-g002.jpg"/></fig><p>Barriers and facilitators to access to care are represented in the above figure using the conceptual framework of the ecological model of behavior change. The concentric circles represent each level of the ecological model, and barriers and facilitators corresponding to each level are represented in the right and left sides, respectively.</p><p>Facilitators at each level are helping a person to move closer to accessing health care while barriers at each level are taking a person away from accessing health care.</p><p>At the individual and interpersonal level, factors such as knowledge, awareness, and willingness to seek care, treatment, etc., are predominant. At the institutional level, i.e., at the school level, awareness among teachers (also emphasizing the need for training about mental health) is an important facilitator, whereas stigma is a crucial community-level barrier for accessing health care. Most facilitators and barriers identified during this systematic review are related to policy-level issues such as quality of health care, HR (availability, training, etc.) healthcare setup, financed, etc.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of the facilitators and barriers to access to care for adolescent mental health in India. Overall, there is a dearth of data on facilitators and barriers for access to health care for mental health issues for adolescents from India.</p><p>During our search, we found that there is an unavailability of articles that directly looked at the barriers and or facilitators of access to care for adolescents&#8217; mental health in India. However, the studies that we finally included in the review were about various issues such as adolescent policies and planning, setting up of adolescent health service and counseling clinics, stressors, and coping mechanisms for adolescent mental health and mental health literacy, which in a way captured access-related barriers and facilitators for adolescent mental health. Secondly, the review also highlighted the availability of evidence from limited geographic areas such as Delhi, Goa, and Kerala, largely from urban settings with practically nothing known about the mental health needs and access to care of adolescents in rural areas. Given that India is one of the youngest countries in the world with a significant adolescent population, and the review highlights the important knowledge gaps in understanding and addressing access to adolescent mental healthcare services.</p><p>Evidence of this systematic review shows that most of the barriers and/or facilitators are categorized in the policy level of the ecological model. These include a lack of dedicated and trained HR, lack of intersectoral coordination, budgetary constraints, lack of adolescent-friendly setup, lack of appropriate health infrastructure, and barriers in the use of non-health professionals or lay health workers and field health workers for preliminary assessment of the issue. Similar policy planning and implementation-related barriers such as lack of intersectoral collaboration, the role of governance, budgetary constraints, and scanty human resources are also reported in the context of various health policies.[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The low remunerations and overwhelming workload appear to be major deterrent for health professionals[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for delivering mental healthcare services. To address this, some researchers have suggested, using community health workers, lay counselors, and peers with relatively lower costs than professional healthcare providers[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to deliver preliminary mental health services. The involvement of non-medical professionals such as teachers could be of immense help in the early identification and management of adolescents with mental illness. In India, about 28% of schoolchildren have mental health problems. In the absence of an adolescent-specific healthcare system and teachers being present in schools, schools can provide the first contact with school-based mental health programs.[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Involving teachers as an important point of contact, schools can become important non-judgmental spaces to assess the mental health needs of adolescents and also for initiating appropriate therapeutic treatment and strengthening linkages to the healthcare system. Therefore, it appears that school teachers and school counselors could be an important resource that can be utilized in the cascade of identification of mental illness, provision of primary support, and facilitation of linkages to healthcare services. However, in India, the majority of school teachers either have no or very rudimentary training in the psychosocial problems of students,[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and therefore, the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of teacher-mediated mental health interventions need to be studied. Similarly, the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of training teachers and school counselors to provide mental health services should be assessed.</p><p>The scaling up of mental healthcare services through primary health care using the WHO mhGAP tool could be an important strategy to minimize the treatment gap.[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This includes primarily training the general healthcare staff like non-specialist doctors, nurses, community health workers, and lay health workers in diagnostic skills as well as in the treatment using cost-effective psychological therapies and medication. The rapid growth of digital interventions in health and their hold on adolescents clearly indicates the need to develop and evaluate the utility of digital interventions in adolescent mental health for promotion, prevention as well as treatment.[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The review also found that the non-healthcare personnel such as parents and friends could be the first important stepping stone for adolescent mental health care and support initiation. If parents are aware of mental illnesses and about appropriate treatment options and their availability, accessing care would be early.[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK)<bold>,</bold> launched by the Government of India in 2014, is a national adolescent health program that focuses on improving the overall health and well-being of adolescents (ages 10&#8211;19). It addresses six key areas, one of which is mental health. The program includes Adolescent-Friendly Health Clinics (AFHCs) that offer counseling and healthcare services, aiming to make health services more accessible and casual. Adolescent-friendly clinics under this program with a more friendly and non-health setup-like environment could lead to more accessibility. The potential of digital interventions for mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment needs to be urgently tapped to reach this young digital friendly population. Training of healthcare professionals especially lay health workers, counselors, and medical officers in adolescent mental healthcare services is crucial for the effective implementation of the health program.</p><p>At the community level or societal level, the presence of stigma is reported to be an important barrier to accessing mental health care. Mental health access-related studies conducted in various countries have also reported stigma or negative social attitudes as an important barrier to accessing health care.[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Stigma is found to be a very important and deeply embedded barrier to accessing mental health care. Socio-cultural context is important to understand and effectively address the stigma.[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Cross-cultural intervention studies should be conducted to understand stigma,[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] which can then inform the stigma reduction social and behavior change communication campaigns.[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>At the individual and family level, negative perception about the public health service was also reported as a barrier to accessing mental health care. Improving the timeliness of providing the available care and improved hospitality at the government health facilities can be low-budget and feasible interventions to improve the poor perception of public health facilities.[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Knowledge about the need or importance of seeking help from doctors or medical treatment is also reported to be low.[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, on the other hand, adolescents seeking help and support from parents and friends highlight the importance of immediate caregivers as the primary support mechanism and hence information related to Common mental disorders (CMD) needs to be targeted toward these immediate caregivers as well as adolescents to improve access to care.[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Awareness among the mothers and caregivers of adolescents helps in increasing the utilization of these services by adolescents.[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Adolescents reported that they would consult parents or friends which highlights the importance of mental health literacy among immediate caregivers seeking help for CMD. Hence, information related to CMD needs to be targeted toward the caregiver as well as adolescents to improve the outcomes.[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Overall, the evidence from this systematic review shows that largely barriers and facilitators reported are related to the policy and health infrastructure. Government must urgently look into the existing policies and programs for adolescents for their effective implementation. If necessary required modifications may also be undertaken in specific adolescent health policies or programs. However, it is important to undertake more research related to adolescent mental health access to care-related issues. The current evidence does not focus much on issues related to individual as well as familial or community levels. It also does not give any understanding of different socio-demographic and cultural background-related aspects of access to care. The current evidence is scanty and from a very limited geographic area.</p><p>There is a huge paucity of research in access to care-related barriers and facilitators for mental health issues in adolescents in India. While understanding the issues in access to care retrospective study of adolescents who have reached to care and how they overcome, the barriers could be one of the approaches.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Despite the rigorous methodology employed in this systematic review, there are few limitations that need to be acknowledged. This study utilized a limited number of databases, specifically Google Scholar and PubMed, chosen for their relevance to the field of public health and ease of access. However, due to resource constraints and subscription-based restrictions on databases such as Embase and Scopus, we could not include these in our review. Future research may benefit from expanding the database search to enhance comprehensiveness further. The search terms used and the databases searched were carefully selected, but there could be a chance that studies published in non-indexed or less commonly accessed sources were not captured. This could result in an underrepresentation of findings from certain geographic regions or contexts, which might limit the generalizability of the results. Studies with null or negative results are less likely to be published in indexed journals, so their exclusion could skew the findings toward more positive or significant outcomes. Including gray literature, such as policy papers, government reports, or theses, might have provided additional insights or different perspectives on the subject that are not captured in published studies. Although the possibility of relevant research being published in languages other than English is minimal in the context of adolescent mental health care in India, this remains a potential limitation of the review and has been acknowledged accordingly. Hence, it is important to consider these limitations when interpreting the results of this systematic review. However, despite these limitations, the review tried to capture all the available studies and provided valuable insights into the current state of evidence on the subject, which could guide future research on the subject.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Evidence for access to mental healthcare-related barriers and facilitators for adolescents in India is very scanty.
