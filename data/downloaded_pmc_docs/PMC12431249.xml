Misuse case modeling is used for identifying and analyzing security requirements in software applications. However, security threats and their corresponding mitigations are inherently cross-cutting concerns. These concerns are scattered and tangled within multiple functional requirements and cannot be modularized using traditional object-oriented techniques. The realization of misuse cases causes crosscutting threats and corresponding mitigations to be scattered and tangled across use cases, resulting in ambiguity, incomplete understanding, and insufficient analysis of security requirements. This study proposes a misuse case modelling method called Aspect-oriented Formalized Misuse Case (AFMUC). It specifies crosscutting security threats separately as an aspect misuse case and integrates them with use cases using an aspect-oriented approach. AFMUC provides structured guidelines and restriction rules for modeling crosscutting security threats and corresponding mitigations using aspect-oriented constructs such as Pointcut, Joinpoint Advice, and Introduction. The aspect threat model is then woven into the base use case model. Similarly, an aspect mitigation model is proposed to specify crosscutting mitigations following the AFMUC restriction rules. The aspect mitigation model is then woven into the base misuse case model. The proposed approach is applied to a case study and evaluated through a controlled experiment involving twenty-four students with a background in information security. The findings indicate that the AFMUC approach is practical and unambiguous for specifying and analyzing crosscutting security requirements. However, some aspect-oriented modeling constructs and restriction rules have been misapplied by students. This shows that while students favored the AFMUC approach, they may have found it challenging to apply the aspect-oriented constructs and restriction rules due to a limited exposure to aspect-oriented modelling.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100023673</institution-id><institution>Deanship of Scientific Research, Imam Mohammed Ibn Saud Islamic University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IMSIU-DDRSP2504</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work is supported and funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU) (grant number IMSIU-DDRSP2504).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="15"/><table-count count="12"/><page-count count="40"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Software applications are essential for various purposes such as information sharing, business transactions, shopping, banking, social interactions, and managing edge intelligence for real-time data processing and decision-making applications. This rapid use also increases the risk of security threats. That makes applications an attractive target for attackers, which leads to critical security breaches, including unauthorized access, information exposure, and others [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The primary factor contributing to these vulnerabilities is the presence of security flaws during the development process of software applications. It is evident that amongst all the identified security threats, 97.5% of threats exist only in the requirement phase of the software development life cycle as compared to other phases. The software applications are vulnerable to attack due to an insufficient analysis of the security threats [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Misuse case modelling [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] is a well-known threat modelling approach for security analysis early in the requirements phase of software development life cycle. It has emerged as a simple and effective approach to identify potential security threats within the functional requirements. As a result, it is a commonly used approach among threat modeling approaches like STRIDE, DREAD, and others [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Misuse case modeling consists of diagram and specifications, built on the standard use case modelling. It is used to analyze security threats and their mitigations. The misuse case specifications complement the misuse case diagram by providing a textual description of the threat scenarios, explaining <italic toggle="yes">how a misuser could compromise the application&#8217;s security</italic> while attacking the functionality, and mitigation explains <italic toggle="yes">how security threats are mitigated to protect the application</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The security threats and their corresponding mitigations are defined as crosscutting concerns within the application. Crosscutting concerns are those aspects of an application that cut across multiple functional modules and cannot be encapsulated within a single module. These concerns are often scattered across various modules and tangled within a single module of an application. Similarly, crosscutting security threats threatens several functional requirements, causing threat scattering, and single functionality is threatened by several threats, causing threat tangling. And their corresponding crosscutting mitigations often mitigate multiple security threats, causing mitigation scattering, and a single threat is mitigated by various mitigations, causing mitigation tangling [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Misuse case model present these threats and mitigations separately, but this separation is not maintained in their realization during software development phase [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. When realizing misuse cases, a threat can attack the attack surfaces (i.e., vulnerable points that expose the application to threats) of several use cases, causing <italic toggle="yes">threat scattering</italic>. Also, a single use case may contain fragments of several threats, leading to <italic toggle="yes">threat tangling</italic>. Similarly, in mitigation realization, a single mitigation prevents many threats while targeting the mitigation surfaces (i.e., threat points that need to be mitigated) in misuse cases, causing <italic toggle="yes">mitigation scattering</italic>. A single threat can be protected by many mitigation cases, causing <italic toggle="yes">mitigation tangling</italic>. The existing misuse case specifications [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] lack in addressing the issues of scattering and tangling (i.e., specifying crosscutting security threats and their crosscutting mitigation). It causes ambiguity and misunderstanding of the threats and their mitigation, leading to an insufficient security requirements analysis.</p><p>Inspired by an Aspect-Oriented Modelling (AOM) approach [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], this study integrates the aspect-oriented constructs in misuse case specifications to develop a structured and formalized misuse case specification template called Aspect-oriented Formalized Misuse Case (AFMUC). AFMUC consists of AOM constructs and restriction rules such as pointcut, joinpoint, advice, and introduction, to specify the crosscutting security threats and corresponding mitigations through misuse case threat modelling approach. The objective is to resolve the problem of tangling and scattering while specifying the crosscutting security threats and their crosscutting mitigation in misuse cases. For elicitation and analysis in a structured and analyzable form, a better variant of misuse case modelling, i.e., Restricted Misuse Case Modelling (RMCM) [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], is adopted. The RMCM is based on a template and restriction rules, providing precise and unambiguous specifications of security threats and their mitigations. The RMCM template is extended with AOM constructs and new restriction rules targeting the unambiguous modelling of the crosscutting threats and their crosscutting mitigations. The AFMUC template presents the AOM constructs, (i.e., <italic toggle="yes">pointcut</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">joinpoint</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">advice,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">introduction)</italic> and restriction rules to specify the crosscutting security threat as an <italic toggle="yes">aspect threat model</italic> and their <italic toggle="yes">aspect mitigation model</italic> in an unambiguous and analyzable manner.</p><p>The proposed AFMUC approach is applied to a case study to assess its applicability, and a controlled experiment is conducted to empirically evaluate the ambiguity in terms of understandability, applicability, restrictiveness, and error rate. The results show that the approach unambiguously specifies the crosscutting threats and their crosscutting mitigation. Unlike the traditional misuse case approach, AFMUC is a novel approach and unambiguously identifies the specific vulnerable points within use cases (precondition, basic flow, postcondition). Furthermore, it supports precise and corresponding mitigation by defining the specific mitigation points for countermeasures within the precondition, basic threat flow, and postcondition of misuse cases. Further, the proposed approach benefits the security requirement engineers in addressing crosscutting threats and their mitigation early in the requirement phase. This facilitates a comprehensive and common understanding of threats and their mitigations, ensuring the consistent development of secure applications throughout the software development life cycle. It also guides the security testers to get detailed information about the attack surfaces and the mitigation surfaces, helping them to identify where to focus their efforts.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The AFMUC, a misuse case description template with AOM constructs and restriction rules, is developed to specify crosscutting threats and their mitigations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The ambiguity of the proposed approach is evaluated through a controlled experiment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The applicability of the proposed AFMUC approach is assessed by applying it to a case study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The results show that the AFMUC approach is unambiguous in terms of understandability, applicability, and restrictiveness.

It is believed that these difficulties may stem from their limited background in aspect-oriented modeling.

Literature shows that the AOM constructs (i.e., pointcut, joinpoint, advice, and introduction) have been integrated into various UML diagrams, such as AspectSM [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Aspect Sequence diagram [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] are effective in modelling crosscutting security threats. To the current understanding, there is a lack of literature specifically addressing crosscutting security concerns in the context of misuse case modelling. This issue, however, is addressed with use cases. Existing methodologies predominantly employ aspect oriented modelling to address crosscutting security concerns in use case modelling. Considering the misuse case is inherited from the use case, the existing work is assessed based on the following criteria: (i) the methodologies employed for modelling and specifying crosscutting security concerns and the utilization of Aspect-Oriented Modelling (AOM) features by use cases. and (ii) the misuse case and mitigation case specifications proposed in the literature to address unambiguous and formal specifications of threats and mitigations.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Crosscutting concerns in use case modelling</title><p>The pioneer of the use case modelling approach, Ivar Jacobson, in the paper [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] has highlighted the challenge of tangling and scattering in the realization of the use case diagram. It employs the &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; relationship involves defining aspects that cut across multiple use cases. It introduces the extension points as pointcuts within the base use case, and joinpoints to specify the locations where these extensions take place. The extension operation then activates advice on the extension pointcut, thereby influencing the behavior linked to the extension in the base use case. Another approach [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] proposed aspect-oriented UML use cases. It defines the crosscutting system functionality as an aspect use case and specifies it with the base use case using pointcut, joinpoint, and advice expressions. It uses the traditional use case &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; relationship representing the crosscutting concerns with the extension point as a pointcut which joins at the steps in the basic flow, applying particular behavior of extension as advice. Based on this specification, the aspect use case model is further specified formally in extended AspectZ.</p><p>There are approaches in literature that provide alternative mechanisms instead of using the traditional &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; relationship [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An existing approach [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] uses aspectual use cases to model crosscutting concerns as non-functional requirements (NFR) that crosscut functional use cases. The NFR is connected to the use case using stereotype &lt;&lt;constrain&gt;&gt;, and itself NFR use case is represented visually using stereotype &lt;&lt;NFR&gt;&gt;. A candidate aspect, considering a use case as a good candidate when it is related to more than one use case using the traditional extend and include relationships. Another approach [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] adapts the use cases to model and specify crosscutting behavior into distinct entities called crosscutting use cases. It represents the NFR as security, reliability, and performance as crosscutting concerns and establishes connections with regular use cases using the &lt;&lt;crosscuts&gt;&gt; relationship. It proposes the concept of a composition table to define the composition between affected use cases and their crosscutting use cases. It includes the details of affected use cases, conditions of composition, the behavior of the crosscutting use case specified as advice using operators after, before, overlap, override, and wrap, at the points in affected use cases where this behavior is applied.</p><p>Since there are approaches in literature that address aspect-oriented modelling with use cases [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. An approach [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] addresses an aspect-oriented use case model that introduces an &#8220;aspects&#8221; block to consolidate new functional and non-functional concerns, such as performance, logging, and authentication, with the core functional use cases. It incorporates aspect-oriented modelling constructs like pointcut, joinpoint, and advice within the use case model. The aspect block is linked with more than one core concern as use cases using the relationship stereotype &lt;&lt;crosscut&gt;&gt;. It consists of the pointcut on the joinpoints in the core use cases and corresponding advice as before, after, and around. Another study [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] defines an aspect-oriented method for defining and addressing security threats within the context of a use case-based functional modelling approach. It introduces a use case template to express crosscutting aspects, recognizing that threats may manifest in various sections of the same or different use cases. The approach aligns the use of pointcuts, joinpoints, and advice with the key points in a use case, such as main flow, alternate flow, precondition, and postcondition. Moreover, one of the studies [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] introduces an aspect-oriented method for defining security requirements through the utilization of aspectual use cases. This involves incorporating a pointcut to select joinpoints in the basic and alternate flows of the base use case to apply advice. This approach proves valuable in modelling functional requirements as base use cases and security requirements as aspectual use cases, enabling security personnel to identify security threats independently of functional requirements. Lee et al. [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] present a goal-driven use case. It defines the base use case, specifying the slice of system functionality used by an actor. Another use case is defined as an aspectual use case, which is also a system functionality that cuts across the base use case. It identifies the aspectual use case that affects the base use case with the defined places as joinpoints. These joinpoints describe the places in the base use case where the aspectual use case weaves its operation along with the weaving operators as insert behavior, replace behavior, or impose constraint. Another study [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] provides an aspect-oriented use case modeling approach for product lines. It considered the functional requirements as variabilities in the system and introduced a &lt;&lt;variability&gt;&gt; relationship specialization of &lt;&lt;aspect&gt; relation. These variable requirements are crosscutting concerns. These variable requirements crosscut the base use case by defining the pointcut expression that signifies the joinpoint within the elements of the base use case, such as steps, operations, alternatives, extension points, and conditions. The pointcut applies the advice on the selected joinpoints using various types, such as before, after, around, and concurrent types. The variable requirements as crosscutting concerns are woven with the common requirements specified by a pointcut expression. Finally, they transformed the aspect model to a Petri net, to generate the state chart and test model through automated and extended tool support as UCEd.</p><p>There are UML profiles SecureUML [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], UMLsec [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], SECTET [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], ModelSec [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and SecureMDD [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] that build UML profiles with the integration of aspect-oriented modelling to address crosscutting security concerns.

The R5 is not applicable here because it specifies the basic mitigation flow, mostly useful in specification of aspect mitigation model.</p><p>Referring to rule R6, the POINTCUT expression <bold>(POINTCUT&lt;name&gt; SUBSET &lt;selection constraint&gt;)</bold> selects the base use case in <bold>&lt;name&gt;</bold> parameter. The SUBSET reflects use case element specified as <bold>BF</bold> (R1), <bold>PRECONDITION</bold> (R2), or <bold>POSTCONDITION (</bold>R3). The <bold>&lt;selection constraint&gt;</bold> is a condition to select the attack surfaces (joinpoints) from the SUBSET. <bold>JOINPOINT</bold> (R7) is an expression <bold>(JOINPOINT &lt;sequence no&gt;)</bold> used to specify the attack surfaces with the sequence numbers that satisfy the selection constraint defined in R6. R6 and R7 collectively form a complete pointcut expression that selects the joinpoints where advice can be applied. To apply advice, all relevant pointcuts and joinpoints must be defined beforehand. Advice is defined as an expression <bold>(ADVICE &lt;type&gt; POINTCUT &lt;sequence no&gt; EXECUTE &lt;flow&gt;)</bold> used to specify the threat behavior. It is applied to the selected joinpoints identified by the pointcut expression. It consists of three parameters where the parameter &lt;<bold>type&gt;</bold> specifies the advice type: <bold>BEFORE</bold> (R9), <bold>AFTER</bold> (R10), or <bold>AROUND</bold> (R11). <bold>BEFORE</bold> Advice indicates that the SUBSET in POINTCUT expression serves as a <bold>PRECONDITION</bold> (R2) of the base use case where JOINPOINT exists, similarly the <bold>AFTER</bold> Advice reflects the SUBSET as <bold>POSTCONDITION</bold> (R3) of the base use case, and the <bold>AROUND</bold> advice applied at JOINPOINT exists at <bold>BF</bold> (R1) of the base use case. The <bold>ADVICE</bold> executes the threat behavior as BTF (R4), representing &#8220;Basic Threat Flow&#8221; in the <bold>&lt;flow&gt; parameter.</bold> This behavior is applied to POINTCUT expressions with their numbers given in parameter <bold>&lt;sequences no&#8201;&gt;&#8201;</bold>. Alternatively, the keyword <bold>ALL</bold> (R14) can be used if <bold>ADVICE</bold> applies to all specified POINTCUT expressions.</p><p>Regarding rule R15, the INTRODUCTION expression is defined to add a new threat to the existing base use case, showing it is a legitimate functionality. The expression <bold>(INTRODUCTION &lt;name&gt; ASSOCIATE TO &lt;use case&gt; AS &lt;dependency&gt;)</bold> specifies the threat name specified in the <bold>&lt;name&gt;</bold> parameter, which is introduced in the application by associating it with the existing base use case in parameter <bold>&lt;use case&#8201;&gt;&#8201;</bold>. The association relationship between the newly added threat and the existing base use case specified in the <bold>&lt;dependency&gt;</bold> parameter.

The <bold>&lt;name&gt;</bold> parameter defines the name of the threat, while the&#8201;<bold>&lt;&#8201;use case&gt;</bold> parameter is used to define the name of base use cases to be replaced. Rule R 13 (||) or R14 (&amp;&amp;) may be used to select multiple use cases to replace them with a threat.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Formalizing the aspect mitigations using restriction rules</title><p>The restriction rules (R2-R14) in <xref rid="pone.0322664.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> are applicable to specify the aspect mitigation using AFMUC aspect mitigation template (<xref rid="pone.0322664.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). While the purpose of these rules remains consistent, their interpretation changes in this context. This is because the base model refers to a misuse case, while the aspect model is an aspect mitigation case. For example, the rule R6 <bold>(POINTCUT&lt;name&gt; SUBSET &lt;selection constraint&gt;)</bold> represents the name of the base misuse case as a POINTCUT in <bold>&lt;name&gt;</bold> parameter. The parameter <bold>&lt;selection constraint&gt;</bold> is used to define the condition to select the joinpoints within misuse case <bold>SUBSET,</bold> such as <bold>PRECONDITION</bold> (R2), <bold>POSTCONDITION</bold> (R3), or <bold>BTF</bold> (R4). The Joinpoints <bold>(JOINPOINT &lt;sequence no&gt;)</bold> select the mitigation surfaces within the <bold>SUBSET</bold> that satisfy the selection constraint. The ADVICE expression <bold>(ADVICE &lt;type&gt; POINTCUT &lt;sequence no&gt; EXECUTE &lt;flow&gt;)</bold> is used to execute the mitigation behavior as <bold>BMF</bold> (R5), on the selected joinpoints. The <bold>&lt;type&gt;</bold> parameter in the <bold>ADVICE</bold> expression determines advice type. <bold>BEFORE</bold> (R9) advice applies when the SUBSET in the POINTCUT expression is <bold>PRECONDITION</bold> (R2), the purpose is to prevent the threat from occurring. <bold>AFTER</bold> (R10) advice is applied when SUBSET is <bold>POSTCONDITION</bold> (R3). It is used to apply post-mitigations after the threat has harmed the application. And lastly, <bold>AROUND</bold> (R11) advice is applied at SUBSET as <bold>BTF</bold> (R4) and is used to mitigate threat by controlling its execution.</p><p>Another difference is that R1, R15, and R16 are not applicable in aspect mitigation. Specifically, R1 is relevant for selecting attack surfaces as joinpoints from the base use case model and is utilized in aspect threat specification, as discussed in section &#8220;Aspect-Oriented Formalized Misuse Cases to Specify Aspect Threats&#8221;. On the other hand, rules R15 and R16 are not applicable because the aspect construct <italic toggle="yes">introduction</italic> is intended to add a new behavior to the application without altering the existing behavior. Accordingly, mitigation inherently involves responding to an applied threat. Therefore, it requires the existence of a threat and cannot be introduced independently.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Example case study</title><p>This section demonstrates the applicability of the proposed AFMUC approach on an excerpt from case study, EU-rent car [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Finally, the reservation is confirmed upon credit card payment. It analyzes the application process and stores the customer&#8217;s sensitive data.

A controlled experiment is conducted to validate the AFMUC unambiguity in specifying crosscutting security threats and mitigations.</p><sec id="sec024"><title>The mobile finance application</title><p>The Mobile Finance Application (MFA) case study is obtained from the industry. To maintain the confidentiality agreement, the organization name is anonymized as &#8220;Company X&#8221;. The acquired software requirements specification for MFA includes its functional and security requirements. It is important to note that this application is neither a practical industrial project nor a student project, but rather a comprehensive application specification designed by industrial security experts and faculty of the Information Security Department based on the provided requirements.</p><p>The objective of MFA application is to provide easy access to financial services to customers via mobile phones or a web portal, offering identical features across both platforms. This study focuses on the web-based services of the MFA application. In MFA, the sensitive information can be processed, stored, and shared by the customer while performing online transactions. The application&#8217;s basic functional requirements include registering customer accounts, logging in, transferring money to various accounts (including bank, mobile, and CNIC), paying bills, loading mobile balances, purchasing mobile bundles, and generating account statements. Due to the involvement of financial transactions, the application is vulnerable to numerous threats. Attackers aim to exploit application vulnerabilities to access sensitive customer information by breaching databases, intercepting network communications, or launching phishing attacks. Additionally, attackers may seek to disrupt application services, rendering them inaccessible to customers. Their goal is to obtain confidential customer information or get financial gains from Company X. Given the time constraint, three significant use cases such as <italic toggle="yes">register customer</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">login</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">transfer money to bank account</italic> are selected, which is threatened by five crosscutting threats (misuse cases) that pose significant threats such as unauthorized access, data modification, mask a web page to compromise services and phishing attack. One mitigation strategy, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">monitoring network&#8221;,</italic> is chosen to focus on, which crosscuts all the defined threats. The threats and mitigations are identified based on standards ISO27001 [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and OWASP [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

The sample of 24 students is selected using a non-probabilistic convenience sampling technique [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Considering this, the students are chosen based on ease of access, having studied courses such as information security, cybersecurity, and secure software design and development. The students are familiar with the threats, mitigations, UML designs, and misuse cases. However, students have no prior understanding of aspect-oriented modeling. To address potential bias, a training session is conducted to familiarize the subjects with AOM before the experiment. The rationale for selecting these students is to find samples that could quickly be trained to use the AOM approach over a short time. The students are recruited for two days and motivated to attend the experiment by being graded for participation. On March 19, 2024, a comprehensive training session is held and completed. On the second day, March 26, 2024, a controlled experiment is conducted to apply and evaluate the proposed approach. Both sessions lasted three hours. Before engaging in the experiment, students are asked to sign a consent form indicating their willingness to utilize their experiment results for research purposes. Additionally, the experiment plan had undergone a thorough review and received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the Computing Department of Riphah University before the execution of the experiment. Subjects actively involved in the experiment expressed their agreement by signing the consent form, confirming their understanding and approval to utilize the obtained data for research purposes. This process ensured a transparent and ethically sound approach to obtaining participants&#8217; informed consent.</p><p>A questionnaire-based evaluation is selected for data collection on the reasoning by Ardalan et al.

Each rule is evaluated to determine whether the subject understands the restriction rule and shares a common understanding. Question 2 contains the question regarding <italic toggle="yes">applicability</italic> of the approach. It defines whether the subjects can properly apply the AFMUC restriction rules for specifying the aspect threats and their aspect mitigations. It is evaluated on a four-point Likert scale. Lastly, question 3 is used to evaluate the <italic toggle="yes">restrictiveness</italic> of the proposed approach, which assesses whether the subject finds the restriction rule challenging to specify.

understandability, applicability, and restrictiveness. The quiz assessment is designed to ensure their understanding of the proposed approach to avoid any potential subjectivity bias in obtaining the data for each measure. The complete quiz is given in &#8220;<xref rid="pone.0322664.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>&#8221;. The quiz questions are designed for each aspect. There are three sections for each question, Section A consists of questions regarding the pointcut expression, including joinpoints. Section B defines the question regarding the advice, and Section C presents a general question. Regarding the aspect element introduction, Section A addresses questions on introduction expression, and Section B consists of a general question. All questions are closed-ended questions, structured as multiple-choice questions, except one open-ended general question where students are asked to justify their choice, whether they experienced any uncertainty in identifying threats or mitigations. All multiple-choice questions contain one correct answer except those marked with three asterisk symbols (***). The justification provided by subjects for each answer is carefully analyzed to assess their understanding of the respective aspects. Total, there are ten multiple-choice questions covering aspects threats and mitigation, and six general questions. The responses to the quiz questionnaire are used to validate the data collected, but they are not analyzed to test the experimental hypothesis.</p><p>&#8226; <bold>Error rate measure:</bold> For the measure of error rate, the raw data is collected from the AFMUC aspect threats and mitigation template attempted by each student. The error rate measures the inaccurate application of the restriction rule. It is measured on a scale of 0 and 1. <xref rid="pone.0322664.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> describes the units to collect the raw data in the form of mistakes made by students in each aspect. These units measure the individual error count for each AFMUC restriction rule presented in <xref rid="pone.0322664.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. And finally, the sum of error rate for each restriction rule, aggregated across all students, is calculated using the formula Error Rate<sub>r</sub>, as defined in <xref rid="pone.0322664.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 1</xref>. All these units and formulas are adopted from Yue et al. [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and modified according to AFMUC restriction rules. For example, the error rate for R1 is calculated as the average of (N<sub>missed</sub>/N<sub>UC</sub>). It captures the rate of occurrences where the BF keyword should be applied, but it is missing. The variable (N<sub>m</sub>) calculates total mistakes made when applying the keyword <bold>BF</bold>. The formula (N<sub>m</sub>/N<sub>BF</sub>) calculates the frequency of keyword BF being misused, applied in an inappropriate context, or used when it should not be. The specifications of the error rate for each rule are specified in <xref rid="pone.0322664.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, along with the description of variable (N<sub>m</sub><italic

A training session is conducted one week before the experiment to idealize the students&#8217; background knowledge and skills. The purpose of this training session is to familiarize the subjects with the basic concepts of AFMUC approach and its artifacts. Subjects engaged in a continuous and interactive three-hour training session, focused on activity-based learning to provide a practical understanding of concepts. The session includes the revision of threat and mitigation modeling using misuse cases and training of essential AOM constructs (i.e., pointcut, joinpoint, advice, introduction). In this session, the explanation of approach is given to the students on the EU-Rent Car [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] case study as an illustrative example. To further enhance students&#8217; preparedness, a home-based graded assignment is designed to help them practice applying the AFMUC and its restriction rules, enabling them to specify aspect-oriented security threats and their corresponding mitigations effectively. Ensuring that they had adequate time to review and understand the basic concepts. Detailed feedback is provided on an assignment before the experiment to address misunderstandings and strengthen their background knowledge. This is planned intentionally because the subjects do not know the AOM used in proposed AFMUC approach. This is carefully maintained to allow the students adequate time to assimilate the training content, including the AOM and restriction rules. Since this is their first experience with it, they need a basic understanding before participating in the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Execution of experiment.</title><p>In this session, students are asked to perform a task on an MFA case study in a controlled laboratory during a three-hour session.

For this purpose, each restriction rule is evaluated using four quantitative measures: understandability, applicability, restrictiveness, and error rate. The first three measures are used to determine the subjective opinion of the students, while the error rate gives the objective measure to collect the errors while applying the rules by students.

The rule is considered to have a high error rate when its score is&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;5%. In <xref rid="pone.0322664.g015" ref-type="fig">Fig 15</xref>, the results show that ten out of sixteen restriction rules attain a high error rate. The highest error rates are R11 and R6, at 11.6% and 10%, respectively. The high error rate for R11 is due to the misuse of the AROUND advice type rule, often applied in situations where it is not required. Similarly, R6 has a high error rate because the pointcut expression contains three different logical expressions inside: (1) specifying the name of the use case or misuse case where the aspect threat or mitigation aspect pointcuts, (2) selecting elements such as BF or BTF in the relevant case, and (3) selecting the constraint to identify the attack surface in the use case or the mitigation surface in the misuse case. It is observed that the high error rate for R6 is due to not completing the expression or specifying the expression in the wrong situation. It is also analyzed that ten rules with high error rates, R1, R2, R4, R6, R7, and R9, R11&#8211;R14, involve key constructs of aspect-oriented modeling, such as specifying pointcut R6 (10%) and joinpoint R7 (8.50%). It shows a higher error rate in identifying joinpoints in the basic flow R1 (7.64%), and precondition R2 (6.67%), and applying the type of AROUND advice R11 (11.6%), and BEFORE advice R9 (7.50%), respectively. The advice threat behavior (BTF), as R4 also shows, has a higher error rate of 7.19%. Furthermore, using logical operators R12, R13, or ALL R14 to select joinpoints also contributed to higher error rates at 5.33%, 6.88%, and 7.71%, respectively. These quantitative findings suggest that students face challenges applying these rules specific to AOM constructs, such as pointcut, joinpoint, and advice. Additionally, it is also analyzed that rules R2, R4, R12, and R14 are perceived as highly understandable, applicable, and less restrictive to use however they present challenges during implementation in actual scenario. It is believed that the high error rates for these essential AOM constructs stem from limited exposure and experience with aspect-oriented modeling. Providing tool support or further training on these rules helps lower the error rate.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0322664.g015" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0322664.g015</object-id><label>Fig 15</label><caption><title>Error Rate of AFMUC Restriction Rules.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0322664.g015.jpg"/></fig><p>In general, it is observed from the results that very few restriction rules are correctly implemented, such as R3, R5, R8, R10, R15, and R16, with low error rate.

It analyzes the correlation between the understandability, applicability, restrictiveness, and error rate. It is expected that the rules that are easy to understand and apply should be less restrictive and have a lower error rate. For this a statistical test Spearman non-parametric correlation test [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] is performed between each pair of understandability, applicability, restrictiveness, and error rate.

It is observed that there exists a positive monotonic relationship between these three variables. Understandability has a meaningful and statistically significant positive relationship with both applicability and restrictiveness with the p-values as 0.022 and &lt;0.001, respectively. This indicates that the AFMUC restriction rules perceived as understandable are also considered as more applicable and less restrictive to use. Similarly, a significant relationship between applicability and low restrictiveness (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.003) also reinforce that AFMUC rules perceived as easier to apply are also less restrictive. These significant relationships between understandability, applicability and restrictiveness, each with p-values below the threshold (p value&#8201;=&#8201;0.05) rejects the null hypothesis and confirms that AFMUC restriction rules are unambiguous to specify the crosscutting security threats and mitigations.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0322664.t007" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0322664.t007</object-id><label>Table 7</label><caption><title>Summary of the spearman correlation test.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="pone.0322664.t007g" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0322664.t007.jpg"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

This indicates that despite being perceived as unambiguous AFMUC rules may still lead to implementation errors. The reason behind this could be that the results are not consistent with all the students, some students have got the maximum understanding of the rules and are able to apply them while making no mistakes or very few.

It is worth noting that rules R2, R4, R12 and R14 show high understanding and applicability (90%&#8722;100%) and are least restrictive (20%), but still have non-negligible error rate (6.67%, 7.19%. 5.33%, 7.71% respectively) when implemented. The rules R3, R5 and R10 generally scored above 90% in understandability and applicability and low error rate as 4.42%, 1.25% and 3.75% respectively. However, they are slightly restrictive, each with a restrictive rate of 25%. Compared to other rules, R2, R4, R12, R14, R3, R5 R10 can be considered among the most unambiguous AFMUC rules. These rules exhibit consistently high understandability and applicability along with slight restrictiveness (R3, R5, and R10) or slightly elevated error rate (R2, R4, R12 and R14). Which can be further enhanced to reduce implementation errors or make it less restrictive. The rules R1, R6, R9, R11, and R13 also exhibit high understandability and applicability (90% and above), but they also show high restrictiveness and a higher error rate. Therefore, these rules can be categorized as moderately unambiguous AFMUC restriction rules, as they are generally understandable and applicable but are challenging and tend to result in errors during implementation. The rules R8, R15, and R16 can be categorized as highly ambiguous, as they contrast a low error rate (less than 5%) with poor results on the other three measures such as understandability, applicability below 90% and restrictiveness above 20%. This indicates that students have perceived these rules as difficult to understand, less applicable, and challenging, but they applied these rules correctly in accordance with no or few mistakes. And lastly, R7 stands out as the highest ambiguous rule, exhibiting poor results across all four evaluation measures of ambiguity. It shows low understandability (85%), low applicability (85%), is considered restrictive (25%), and has a high error rate (8.5%). This indicates that students face consistent difficulty in understanding and implementing the R7.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0322664.t008" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0322664.t008</object-id><label>Table 8</label><caption><title>Comparative analysis of understandability, applicability, restrictiveness and error rate.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="pone.0322664.t008g" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0322664.t008.jpg"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rules</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Understandability</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High Applicability</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High Restrictiveness</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Error Rate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

A discussion of the study results considering the research questions as follows:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>RQ: Is the AFMUC unambiguous enough to model the crosscutting security threats and mitigations?</p></list-item></list><p>The findings indicate that the proposed approach, AFMUC, unambiguously specifies crosscutting threats and their mitigations. The approach is easy to understand, applicable, and less restrictive in specifying aspect threats and mitigations. However, the observations of the error rates reveal that few essential aspect-oriented constructs specifically pointcut, joinpoint, and the application of before, after, and around advice, exhibited high error rates. This suggests that while the AFMUC is initially understandable and adaptable, its practical implementation in real scenarios presents challenges, making it difficult to accurately specify these essential concepts within the AFMUC model.</p><p>Reflecting the purpose of proposed approach, the AFMUC approach is unique and novel, as the existing literature does not provide evidence of utilizing misuse case and mitigation specification models for aspect threats and their mitigation with pointcut, joinpoint, advice, introduction, and weaving. Additionally, AFMUC is designed to be generic as it provides a reusable and extensible framework that can be adaptable to diverse application domain. Furthermore, the approach is scalable, enables the effective handling of large system with growing functionality and number of crosscutting threats and their corresponding mitigations. AFMUC modular design supports scalability by allowing to model crosscutting threats and mitigation independently as aspect threats and aspect mitigations and then woven to use cases and misuse case respectively. This scalability is particularly advantageous for security analysts, as it allows for an unambiguous and manageable specification of crosscutting security requirements within larger systems, enhancing overall application security. Furthermore, it benefits the security testers to precisely identify all attack surfaces and mitigate them by identifying corresponding mitigation surfaces.</p><sec id="sec041"><title>Comparison of existing (mis)use case approach</title><p>This section compares the proposed approach with existing work that specifying the specify the crosscutting concerns using use case Since proposed work AFMUC focuses on the modelling of crosscutting security concerns through misuse case model. <xref rid="pone.0322664.t009" ref-type="table">Tables 9</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0322664.t010" ref-type="table">10</xref> compared with two dimensions: (1) features of aspect oriented supported by use cases such as pointcut, joinpoint, advice and its type, introduction and weaving.

In addition, the AFMUC explicitly and precisely specifies the attack surfaces within the use case basic flow, precondition, postcondition and dependency, that are vulnerable to threats. Similarly, the AFMUC mitigation template significantly enhances mitigation analysis by precisely specifying the mitigation surfaces with the misuse cases precondition, basic threat flow and postcondition.

Additionally, it also supports mitigation analysis by identifying crosscutting mitigations, analyzing their behavior, and understanding their interaction with corresponding threats while determining appropriate mitigation surfaces. AFMUC is important for security engineers to understand threat behavior, locate vulnerabilities and mitigation points in the model for secure application development.</p></sec><sec id="sec044"><title>Limitation.</title><p>In use case specification template, alternate flow is a fundamental element to describe the deviation of the flow from basic successful scenario of use case. Alternate flow can also expose to potential vulnerabilities to be attacked by crosscutting security threats. Although the proposed AFMUC method effectively finds attack surfaces in Usecase basic flows, postconditions, and preconditions, it may not be suitable in the scenario involving alternate flow. This gap could potentially affect overall system security by making it more difficult to identify and modularize crosscutting threats that appear specifically within these alternate flows. Moreover, mitigation surfaces corresponding to alternate threat flows in misuse cases also require careful identification and modelling to ensure robust mitigation mechanism. Extending AFMUC to explicitly incorporate alternate flows in use cases and alternate threat flow in misuse case is crucial. This extension would enable the identification and modularization of crosscutting threats and their corresponding mitigation surfaces throughout all execution paths, enhancing the AFMUC ability to support comprehensive security threat and mitigation analysis.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec045"><title>Threats to validity</title><p>This section describes the threats to validity of the experiment conducted to evaluate the proposed AFMUC approach, following the guidelines by Wohlen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><sec id="sec046"><title>Conclusion validity</title><p>One of the potential threats to the proposed approach is that the generalizability of the results depending on the sample size selected for the experiment is a good representative of the students. To reduce this threat, a convenience sample technique [<xref rid="pone.0322664.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] is followed to select students who are available at the moment and meet the criteria of the study. To generalize the results, the findings are also statistically analyzed using a non-parametric test, specifically the Spearman correlation test which is suitable for the small sample size.</p></sec><sec id="sec047"><title>Internal validity</title><p>Another threat to the validity of results relates to the experiment design and procedure. To limit these threats, the experiment is piloted with the undergraduate students and faculty of the information security program to reduce any potential bias and ambiguity in the design of experiment objects. At the beginning of the experiment comprehensive training on the new approach aspect-oriented modelling and AFMUC approach is provided to the participants. Additionally, participants are given a home-based assignment on an example case study, i.e., EU-Rent car. Before the execution of the experiment, feedback is provided to individual participants. The assignment is graded to keep participants motivated to learn. Additionally, to assess the results that are based on subjective opinions, participants are asked to complete a quiz during the experiment to prevent potential bias while applying the proposed approach. The quiz is used to check the consistency of the results obtained from experiment and quiz but is not used to conclude the research outcome. Additionally, to maintain the authenticity and integrity of results, the participants are graded in their course while participating in experiment.</p></sec><sec id="sec048"><title>Construct validity</title><p>There is a threat of the case study design to cover the proposed approach. To validate the AFMUC approach, MFA case study is designed, encompassing sufficient use cases threatened by aspect threats and their aspect mitigation. Five aspect threats threatening two use cases are selected along with one mitigation to mitigate these aspect threats. This ensures comprehensive coverage of the restriction rules, this selection included coverage of all essential constructs of the proposed approach such as pointcut, joinpoint, advice, and introduction. The small excerpt of case study is deliberately chosen because the primary objective is to evaluate the initial viability and coverage of the approach within a specific and manageable context. However, it is important to note that, to the best of current knowledge, the approach presented is novel.</p></sec><sec id="sec049"><title>External validity</title><p>There is a threat to the validity of time and selection of students as subjects instead of professionals. This threat is addressed by keeping the industrial case study small, including three substantial use cases, five aspect threats, and one mitigation. The focused timeframe of three hours is thoughtfully chosen for a session to effectively assess the AFMUC constructs and restriction rules. This duration is sufficient to guide participants through the tasks without causing exhaustion while allowing for the thorough application and assessment of AFMUC. That is enough to complete in a three-hour session and cover the proposed approach. Selecting students as participants has posed another threat. However, students with suitable knowledge, skills, and backgrounds are chosen, and they have also received comprehensive training on the approach. This decision is made because industrial experts and practitioners have limited knowledge of AOM and would require significant training, time, and cost to learn it. Conversely, students are more inclined to learn new concepts.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec050"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This paper presents a misuse case driven aspect-oriented approach called AFMUC to model the crosscutting security threats and their mitigations. The motivation is to develop secure online software applications by addressing and modelling the crosscutting security threats early in the software development phase ideally in the requirements analysis phase.</p><p>The proposed AFMUC approach has adopted the existing misuse case and security use case templates and extended them with aspect-oriented modeling constructs and restriction rules. The key properties of AFMUC modelling approach include specification of the crosscutting threats and crosscutting mitigations in an unambiguous and formalized manner. It enables precise analysis of aspect threats by identifying multiple attack surfaces in use cases, and the aspect mitigations to mitigate multiple threats by identifying mitigation surfaces in misuse cases. The aspect threats and mitigation specification are formalized using AFMUC restriction rules covering essential constructs of aspect-oriented modelling such as pointcut, joinpoint, advice, and introduction. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated with 24 students in a controlled environment, having background knowledge of information security. The ambiguity of AFMUC is assessed in terms of its understandability, applicability, restrictiveness, and error rate. The results show that the AFMUC constructs, and restriction rules are understandable and applicable with low restrictiveness. These findings have also been shown to be statistically significant. However, in terms of error rate, the results are insignificant. The reason for such results may be the aspect-oriented approach and use of restriction rules are new to subject. The analysis of the study summarizes that the proposed approach is novel and effectively addresses the challenge of modeling crosscutting security threats and their mitigation by utilizing misuse cases and mitigation cases early in the software requirements phase. While the proposed approach shows considerable promise in addressing security concerns through aspect-oriented modeling, there is still a significant scope for improvement. One key area for enhancement is extending support to additional elements of use cases, such as alternate flows and exception scenarios, which are currently not addressed. These elements can contain critical security-relevant behaviors and potential vulnerabilities that need to be modeled and analyzed effectively. Future work could focus on identifying join points within these alternate and exceptional flows to enable comprehensive threat modeling. Additionally, improvements could include developing tool support to facilitate automation, enhance usability, and encourage wider adoption in industrial settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec051"><title>Future work</title><p>In future work, one of the directions is to conduct extensive empirical evaluation of the AFMUC approach using larger sample sizes and real-world case studies. This will allow us to assess the scalability, adaptability, and practical impact of the framework in diverse application domains. These experiments will also help validate the generalizability and robustness of the proposed AFMUC approach against crosscutting security threats and mitigations. We plan to formally verify the AFMUC approach using formal methods and automate the weaving of the aspect model into the base model. Efforts can focus on developing a tool to identify cross-cutting security threats and corresponding mitigations using AFMUC, to enhance its adoption and practicality for practitioners. Furthermore, collaborating with industry partners to replicate the study in real-world settings and comparing the results with student data will further demonstrate efficiency and applicability of the approach. More studies can be conducted to further evaluate the consistency of proposed approach in transforming to other analysis models, code generation, and testing for secure software development.</p></sec><sec id="sec052" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0322664.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Quiz Questionnaire.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0322664.s001.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0322664.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 Data</label><caption><title>Raw Data.</title><p>(RAR)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0322664.s002.rar" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0322664.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name name-style="western"><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Shrikant</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Olaolu</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name>. <article-title>Security, privacy, trust, and provenance issues in internet of things&#8211;based edge environment.</article-title> In <source>IoT Edge Intelligence, </source>S.

Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English??&gt;</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;No</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;This paper includes a very detailed discussion of a method for analyzing crosscutting security threats and mitigations. The authors use an Aspect-Oriented Formalized Misuse Case (AFMUC) template to assist in formalizing misuse cases. The paper includes a rental car example (EU Rent a Car) and a mobile Finance Application (MFA). In addition to providing an example of how the method can be applied, an experiment took place that included 24 students, each applying the method.</p><p>The authors give step-by-step details on how to apply the method and the associated results. Many illustrations and tables are incorporated into the paper for this purpose. It should be possible for other researchers to replicate the experiment or perhaps perform a larger experiment with more comprehensive results.</p><p>The discussion of related work is good and the references are adequate.</p><p>There are several weaknesses. 1) As the authors state, the results are limited to one set of 24 students. I would have preferred seeing the results over multiple cohorts of students. 2) The students don't have the ideal background for the case study, and other than possibly having some courses in common, may have significantly different backgrounds. 3) The case study is very small. A single application of the method in a small case study of 3 hours is not really adequate to determine the efficacy of the method. 4) I did not see adequate support for the conclusion that students faced difficulties, in some cases, due to lack of exposure to aspect-oriented modelling. The evidence for this conclusion and more generally for the usefulness of the method/template is lacking. 5) On page 3 under item 4, you propose extensive training, but it's unknown whether that would help. More work is needed to make this determination.</p><p>Overall, I would suggest that the authors repeat the experiment with a different group of students, perhaps at another university and with more consistent backgrounds, perform the extensive training to remove ambiguity in the results, and use something other than opinion surveys to get a more objective assessment of the results. I also recommend replicating the experiment with an industry partner to get a different audience and compare those results to the student results.</p><p>There are many places where the English usage is awkward, and for unknown reasons, typos have been introduced. I don't know if the authors wrote the paper in another language and then attempted to translate it into English, OR if they attempted to write it in English and didn't proofread it adequately. If accepted for publication, these problems must be fixed. Some examples follow: Under the results summary on the first page "rather face difficulty" should be "rather than face difficulty". On page 2, "lack to", where it should be "fail to", also, "excessive" should be "extensive". On page 5, replace "flow is known" with "flow and is known". On other pages, "INTRODUCTION" is misspelled as "INTROCUDTION" and "EXECUTION" is misspelled as "EXCUTION". These are just examples, I did not do a thorough edit, since this is what the authors need to do.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Strengths:</p><p>Innovative Approach:</p><p>The paper introduces a novel method by formalizing aspect-oriented misuse cases, which effectively highlights the intersection of security threats and mitigations.

<named-content content-type="author-response-date">17 Feb 2025</named-content>
</p><p>Dr. Nadeem</p><p>Journal Editor</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>17th February 2025</p><p>Dear Dr. Nadeem</p><p>Thank you for appreciating our study and inviting us to submit a revised manuscript entitled, &#8220;Formalized Aspect-oriented Misuse Case for Specifying Crosscutting Security Threats and Mitigations&#8221; to PLOS One. We also appreciate the time and effort you and each of the reviewers have dedicated to providing insightful feedback on ways to strengthen our study. Thus, it is with great pleasure that we resubmit our manuscript for further consideration. We have incorporated changes that reflect the detailed suggestions you have provided. We also hope that our revision and the responses we provide below satisfactorily address all the issues and concerns that have been shared.</p><p>To facilitate review of our revisions according to Comments by Academic Editor and Review Comments by Reviewers, the following is a point-by-point response to the questions and comments delivered in email dated 8 January 2025. Additionally for ease, we also referenced each change in the manuscript &#8220;Revised manuscript with track changes&#8221; using the Word comment feature, relating it to the corresponding reviewer comment number.</p><p>Comment by academic editor</p><p>&#8226; The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented.</p><p>REPONSE: We appreciate your valuable feedback and understand the importance of addressing the points mentioned in review. We have incorporated the reviewers' feedback into the revised manuscript, which now includes a comprehensive explanation of the concerns raised as justification to sample size, student backgrounds, case study scope, reason of student difficulties with detailed results, detailed literature review with highlighted key differences, need of tool support, scalability, evaluation metrics and others, alongside improvements in Grammer and Spellings. We also added a " Future Work" section that addresses the suggestions given by the reviewers.</p><p>&#8226; The PLOS Data policy requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p><p>RESPONSE: As per your suggestion, we have ensured full accessibility to the data without any restrictions. The complete dataset is provided as supporting files in archived folder titled &#8220;collected data for each metric&#8221; containing one file, titled "Error Rate Calculation," includes detailed data gathered to calculate the error rate for each rule by each subject, covering the AFMUC approach comprehensively. Another file, titled "Ambiguity-Understandability, Applicability, Restrictiveness, and Error Rate," contains aggregate data measuring the ambiguity of AFMUC in terms of understandability, applicability, restrictiveness and error rate. We have also provided &#8220;statistical test data&#8221; and the results analyzing the relationship between the measures of ambiguity as a supporting file. The data was collected anonymously, adhering to all necessary ethical approval procedures. To promote transparency, the entire dataset has been made fully available.</p><p>&#8226; PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p><p>RESPONSE: We have carefully revised the manuscript, addressing all typographical and grammatical errors. The text has been carefully proofread and subjected to a comprehensive grammar check to ensure clarity, accuracy, and readability throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Comments by reviewers</p><p>REVIEWER 1 COMMENTS:</p><p>1. As the authors state, the results are limited to one set of 24 students. I would have preferred seeing the results over multiple cohorts of students.</p><p>RESPONSE: We accept that the results are currently limited to one cohort of 24 students. primarily because of ease of access to students with the required technical skill set. As per your comments, we have revised the manuscript with comprehensive justification in section &#8220;population and sampling&#8221; with detailed justification of our population also we have updated the section &#8220;conclusion validity&#8221; to address this potential threat to study.</p><p>2. The students don't have the ideal background for the case study, and other than possibly having some courses in common, may have significantly different backgrounds.</p><p>RESPONSE: We have selected the students based on defined criteria for technical skills set in terms of the courses studied. Additionally, to ensure their consistent background and their preparedness before the experiment, we gave them the training session on AFMUC and its fundamental concepts. Moreover, the training session included hand on experience to practice the AFMUC, and graded assignment was designed to assure the shared understanding of the concepts before the experiment. These measures were implemented to idealize students&#8217; knowledge and skills according to the required criteria. As per your comments, we have now comprehensively detailed these efforts in the manuscript, under the section &#8220;Population and Sampling Strategy&#8221; and &#8220;Training of subject&#8221; section with the detailed background courses and training procedure respectively.</p><p>3. The case study is very small. A single application of the method in a small case study of 3 hours is not really adequate to determine the efficacy of the method.</p><p>RESPONSE: We agree with your comment. The case study is small, with a duration of only three hours. The size of case study was kept small intentionally because our objective was to fully demonstrate the proposed AFMUC approach, instead of covering all aspects of case study. The rationale for the size of case study and timeframe of the experiment has been outlined and revised in the manuscript under the headings &#8220;Case study: mobile finance application&#8221; to justify the selection of case study. "Construct Validity" to justify the size of the case study and "External Validity&#8221; to justify the selection of time.</p><p>4. I did not see adequate support for the conclusion that students faced difficulties, in some cases, due to lack of exposure to aspect-oriented modelling. The evidence for this conclusion and more generally for the usefulness of the method/template is lacking.</p><p>RESPONSE: We have observed the difficulty of students based on analysis of quantitative data under the measure of error rate. The high error rate while applying the essential concepts of the approach as pointcut, joinpoint expression and advice type shows that students face difficulty while applying those in practical scenario. which we believe were partly due to their limited exposure to aspect-oriented modeling (AOM). Based on comments, we comprehensively addressed this and revised the section &#8220;error Rate&#8221; with detailed analysis of results in line with this comment.</p><p>5. On page 3 under item 4, you propose extensive training, but it's unknown whether that would help. More work is needed to make this determination.</p><p>RESPONSE: We appreciate your insightful suggestions. We agree that providing more details about the extensive training and results of the study would enhance the clarity of our work. In the revised work, on page 3 under the "Introduction" section we have clarified this point and provided a more comprehensive overview. We hope this revision better conveys the depth of the training and the context of the study results.</p><p>6. I would suggest that the authors repeat the experiment with a different group of students, perhaps at another university and with more consistent backgrounds, perform the extensive training to remove ambiguity in the results, and use something other than opinion surveys to get a more objective assessment of the results. I also recommend replicating the experiment with an industry partner to get a different audience and compare those results to the student results.</p><p>RESPONSE: We appreciate your comments and suggestions. We also believe that our research study has opened possibilities for other researchers to replicate the experiment or perhaps perform a larger experiment with more comprehensive results. We acknowledge the importance of these suggestions and revised the manuscript while incorporates these as open research directions in the newly added section &#8220;Future work&#8221;</p><p>7. There are many places where the English usage is awkward, and for unknown reasons, typos have been introduced. I don't know if the authors wrote the paper in another language and then attempted to translate it into English, OR if they attempted to write it in English and didn't proofread it adequately. If accepted for publication, these problems must be fixed. Some examples follow: Under the results summary on the first page "rather face difficulty" should be "rather than face difficulty". On page 2, "lack to", where it should be "fail to", also, "excessive" should be "extensive". On page 5, replace "flow is known" with "flow and is known". On other pages, "INTRODUCTION" is misspelled as "INTROCUDTION" and "EXECUTION" is misspelled as "EXCUTION". These are just examples, I did not do a thorough edit, since this is what the authors need to do.</p><p>RESPONSE: We appreciate your careful review and understand the importance of clear and accurate language in conveying our work. We thoroughly proofread the manuscript. On the first page the result summary is revised. and correct all identified issues, including the examples you mentioned, to ensure the language is smooth and the manuscript is ready for publication</p><p>REVIEWER 2 COMMENTS:</p><p>1. Literature Review Depth:</p><p>While the paper briefly touches on related work, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of existing methodologies for modeling security threats. Highlighting key differences would strengthen the argument for the proposed approach.</p><p>RESPONSE: In response to your feedback, we have updated the literature review to provide a more in-depth exploration of existing methodologies for modeling security threats. We update literature studies with more details. Each sub section under related work is revised with the key differences and at the end, we also give a research gap which strengthens the need of our approach. We have revised the &#8220;related work&#8221; section with details and added new subsection as &#8220;Research gap analysis&#8221;</p><p>2. Consider incorporating a case study or an application to a real-world system. This would provide tangible evidence of the method's effectiveness and practicality.</p><p>RESPONSE: We have considered incorporating the case study to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed AFMUC approach. We have used the Mobile financing case study (MFA) obtained from the industry partner. To maintain the confidentiality agreement, we anonymized it as company &#8220;X&#8221;. We have obtained the software requirements specification of MFA including security requirements. With the help of security experts from industry and two experts from academia from the information security domain, we have designed threats and mitigations for MFA to prepare the case study in the context of this research.</p><p>3. It would be helpful to discuss or propose tool support for implementing the formalized aspect-oriented misuse cases. This addition could significantly enhance adoption by practitioners.</p><p>RESPONSE: We agree that discussing tool support for implementing formalized aspect-oriented misuse cases (AFMUC) would greatly enhance the adoption of the method by practitioners. We have discussed the need of tool support in sub section &#8220;error rate&#8221; under the main section &#8220;Results and Analysis&#8221; Additionally, we have provided this suggestion as open direction in the future work sections of the manuscript.</p><p>4. The evaluation of the approach lacks quantitative metrics. Including metrics or benchmarks for comparison would lend credibility to the claims of effectiveness and efficiency.</p><p>RESPONSE: We have included the metrics to claim the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach for proposed study. Since AFMUC is a novel approach, without having established benchmarks for comparison, we have defined quantitative metrics to evaluate the understandability, applicability, restrictiveness, and error rate for the AFMUC approach. We have designed the questionnaire to collect quantitative data for these metrics and design formulas to calculate the error rate for each AFMUC rule. The measures for these metrices are adopted from the literature and referenced in the manuscript. For evidence we also have provided the supporting files (collected data for each metric) representing the data for these metrices i.e., understandability, applicability, restrictiveness, and error rate with the revised submission. Additionally, the results and analysis section included the findings for each metric&#8212;understandability, applicability, restrictiveness, and error rate&#8212;along with their statistical analysis. To address your comments clearly in the manuscript, we have revised the manuscript by adding a new point as &#8220;data collection&#8221; under the main section &#8220;Experimentation&#8221;</p><p>5. The methodology&#8217;s scalability for large-scale systems remains unclear. Expanding on this aspect or conducting experiments on larger systems would strengthen the paper.</p><p>RESPONSE: We appreciate your suggestions. The proposed approach is scalable to a larger context. To address this, we have expanded this aspect in the discussion section of the manuscript. Also to further evaluate the scalability of the approach, we provided open directions in the section &#8220;Future Work&#8221;.</p><p>6. Clarity in Terminology:</p><p>Some terms, such as "crosscutting concerns," might not be familiar to all readers. A brief explanation or glossary would aid understanding.</p><p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your thoughtful suggestion. We agree that terms like "crosscutting concerns" may not be familiar to all readers. To address this, we have added a brief explanation of this term in the "Introduction" section.</p><p>7. Grammar and Syntax:</p><p>A thorough proofreading is recommended to eliminate minor grammatical errors and ensure smooth readability.</p><p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your feedback. We are sorry for such mistakes. We have thoroughly proofread the manuscript to eliminate any minor grammatical errors and ensure smooth readability.</p><p>8. Visual Aids:</p><p>While the diagrams are helpful, improving their clarity (e.g., using color coding or annotations) could enhance their effectiveness.</p><p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your suggestion. We make these adjustments according to the PLOS figures guidelines in the revised version to ensure the diagrams are more visually clear and informative. We also gave the color codes to the results in graphical charts under the section results and analysis for understandability, applicability, restrictiveness and error rate.</p><p>9. Consistency in Formatting:</p><p>Ensure consistency in the formatting of headings, citations, and references for a professional presentation.</p><p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your feedback. We have followed the PLOS ONE style guidelines for formatting headings, citations, and references to ensure consistency and maintain a professional presentation. We carefully review these elements to ensure full adherence to the guidelines in the revised version.</p><p>10. Future Work Section:</p><p>Expanding the future work section to outline specific research directions or challenges would provide valuable insights for readers interested in this field.</p><p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added a "Future Work" section to the manuscript, where we outline specific research directions and challenges. We believe this addition will provide valuable insights fo</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0322664.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0322664.s005.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0322664.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0322664.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Morgan</surname><given-names initials="J">Jason</given-names></name><role>Staff Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Jason Morgan</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Jason Morgan</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj003" xml:lang="en" journal-id="PLoS One" journal-id-type="nlm-ta" ext-link-type="pubmed" xlink:href="40938936"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

My remaining concerns are: 1)Although the paper is now easily readable, there are still some places where English phrases appear that are not sentences, generally because a verb is missing. 2) While I still would prefer seeing additional experimental results prior to publication, the Future Work section partially addresses this concern.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Here are the minor review comments for the paper entitled "Formalized Aspect-oriented Misuse Case for Specifying Crosscutting Security Threats and Mitigations":</p><p>Review Comments:</p><p>Clarity of Terminology:</p><p>In the abstract and introduction, it would be helpful to provide a brief definition or explanation of aspect-oriented misuse cases for readers who might not be familiar with this specific terminology.</p><p>Consider clarifying the term "crosscutting security threats" early in the paper to ensure it is clearly understood in the context of your framework.</p><p>Introduction Section:</p><p>The introduction provides a good overview of the problem, but it would benefit from a more explicit explanation of how the proposed method improves upon existing approaches. Perhaps adding a sentence comparing it to the state-of-the-art in threat modeling or misuse case analysis could help readers better understand the novelty and importance of your work.</p><p>Motivation and Justification:</p><p>While the motivations for using aspect-oriented modeling are explained, it could be useful to include a more detailed justification of why misuse cases specifically are an appropriate vehicle for specifying security threats in comparison to other threat modeling techniques.</p><p>Methodology Section:</p><p>The methodology section could be expanded to provide more examples or case studies to illustrate how your approach can be applied to real-world security scenarios.</p><p>It would be useful to include a brief comparison of the proposed approach with traditional threat modeling techniques like STRIDE or DREAD to highlight its unique contributions.</p><p>Figures and Diagrams:</p><p>The diagrams illustrating the aspect-oriented misuse cases are very helpful, but some of them might benefit from additional labeling or annotations to make them easier to follow for readers less familiar with this modeling technique.</p><p>In Figure X, it might be helpful to add more context or a legend to explain the relationships between the components, especially for readers unfamiliar with the specifics of aspect-oriented programming or misuse case methodology.</p><p>Results and Discussion:</p><p>The results presented are interesting, but the paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed approach. Are there any scenarios where it might not be suitable?</p><p>The paper could also discuss how the framework can be adapted or scaled for different types of applications, particularly when dealing with complex or large systems.</p><p>Related Work:</p><p>The related work section is comprehensive, but it would be helpful to briefly mention recent advancements in the integration of security in aspect-oriented programming (AOP) or misuse case approaches, to situate the work in the broader academic landscape.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The conclusion is clear but could be slightly expanded to suggest future work or possible directions for improving the framework. What are the next steps for integrating this approach with real-world security applications or tools?</p><p>References:</p><p>Ensure that all references are correctly formatted according to the journal&#8217;s guidelines. A minor formatting issue was noted in reference [X].</p><p>Consider adding a few more recent references (2019 and later) that discuss the application of AOP in security modeling to strengthen the paper's current relevance.</p><p>Minor Typographical/Grammar Issues:</p><p>In the sentence "The aspect-oriented misuse case are designed to handle..." the verb "are" should be replaced with "is" to ensure subject-verb agreement.</p><p>A few minor grammatical errors in sections 4.2 and 5.1.

</p><p>PLOS Journal Submissions Rebuttal Letter</p><p>Journal Editor</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Date 28th May 2025</p><p>Dear Dr. Jason Morgan</p><p>Thank you for appreciating our study and inviting us to submit a revised manuscript entitled, &#8220;Formalized Aspect-oriented Misuse Case for Specifying Crosscutting Security Threats and Mitigations&#8221; to PLOS One. We appreciate the reviewers&#8217; continued efforts in evaluating our manuscript and their insightful comments in this second round of review. We have carefully considered each point raised and have revised the manuscript accordingly to address the remaining concerns. In the following responses, we provide a detailed account of the changes made and the rationale behind them. We believe that these revisions have strengthened the quality and clarity of the manuscript, and we hope that it now meets the standards for publication.</p><p>To facilitate review of our revisions according to Comments by Academic Editor and Review Comments by Reviewers, and attached PDF file, the following is a point-by-point response to the questions and comments delivered in email dated 30th April 2025. Additionally for ease, we also referenced each change in the manuscript &#8220;Revised manuscript with track changes&#8221; using the Word comment feature, relating it to the corresponding reviewer comment number.</p><p>Comments from PLOS Editorial Office:</p><p>We note that one or more reviewers has recommended that you cite specific previously published works in the current and previous rounds of revision. As always, we recommend that you please review and evaluate the requested works to determine whether they are relevant and should be cited. It is not a requirement to cite these works and you may remove any added citations before the manuscript proceeds to publication. We appreciate your attention to this request.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We carefully reviewed the comment regarding citation of previously published works recommended by the reviewers in the current and earlier revisions. In the current revision, Reviewer #3 suggested citing the following work: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58388-9_8" ext-link-type="uri">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58388-9_8</ext-link>.</p><p>After thoroughly reviewing this suggested paper, we determined that it does not directly align with our study's primary objective or in related work section, which is regarding the modeling crosscutting security threats and corresponding mitigations. However, it does effectively emphasize the broader importance of addressing security in software applications.</p><p>In recognition of this relevance, we have incorporated this citation into the &#8220;Introduction&#8221; section to contextualize the significance of security requirements in modern software applications. We believe this addition appropriately acknowledges the contribution of the suggested work without misrepresenting its scope.</p><p>Additionally, in response to reviewer&#8217;s comments, we also have revised our references across the manuscript to enhance current and more relevant existing work. A detailed breakdown of these changes, along with the justification including comment number and corresponding citations, is provided below for clarity and ease of review.</p><p>New reference/citation added in manuscript Year Justification + comment # Changes made in manuscript</p><p>[1]</p><p>2024 Added to enhance the need for security in software applications.</p><p>Suggested by reviewer#3 comment # 3 Introduction section</p><p>[4] [5] [6]</p><p>2024, 2021, 2019 respectively Added to justify the need of misuse cases and they are simple and easy as compare to other threat modelling approaches.</p><p>Reviewer 2 comment 3 and 5 Introduction section</p><p>[12][13] 2022, 2014 respectively Added AOM based OR misuse case based existing approaches, add recent work</p><p>Reviewer 2 comment 9,11 Attached PDF comment 5, 12 Related work</p><p>[42] [43] [44] 2021, 2022, 1999 Comparison to existing threat modelling approaches STRIDE DREAD etc.</p><p>Reviewer 2 comment 5, attached PDF comment 12 Discussion-&gt; Comparison to existing work</p><p>Comments by reviewers</p><p>REVIEWER 1 COMMENTS:</p><p>1)Although the paper is now easily readable, there are still some places where English phrases appear that are not sentences, generally because a verb is missing.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We appreciate your observation, which has helped us improve the overall clarity and readability of the paper. We thoroughly reviewed the manuscript and carefully revised all sentences where verbs were missing or where phrases did not form complete sentences.</p><p>2) While I still would prefer seeing additional experimental results prior to publication, the Future Work section partially addresses this concern.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for this thoughtful and constructive comment. We fully acknowledge the importance of broader empirical evaluation and agree that additional experimental results would further enhance the rigor and applicability of our proposed AFMUC approach. However, given the current scope and objectives of this study, our focus has been on the initial verification and validation of the foundational AFMUC approach.</p><p>Based on the reviewer&#8217;s comment, we have revised the &#8220;Future Work&#8221; section to explicitly state our plan to extend this work with additional experiments, including larger sample sizes and real time case studies. We are committed to pursuing this direction in the next phase of our research and believe it will meaningfully complement the current findings.</p><p>REVIEWER 2 COMMENTS:</p><p>1. Clarity of Terminology:</p><p>In the abstract and introduction, it would be helpful to provide a brief definition or explanation of aspect-oriented misuse cases for readers who might not be familiar with this specific terminology.</p><p>Consider clarifying the term "crosscutting security threats" early in the paper to ensure it is clearly understood in the context of your framework.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Considering the comment we have updated the &#8220;Abstract&#8221; and &#8220;Introduction&#8221; sections with the brief definition of terminologies aspect-oriented misuse cases and crosscutting security threats. The detailed concepts of the AFMUC approach e.g., aspect-oriented misuse cases and mitigation cases are provided on pages 4 and 5 under the heading AFMUC Construct, where we define essential AOM constructs including aspect, pointcut, joinpoint, advice, and introduction core definition and then in the context of proposed approach. Furthermore, this section has been updated to include the definition of weaving, clarifying how the weaving process is applied within the context of the proposed AFMUC approach. We acknowledge this omission in the original version and appreciate the opportunity to address it.</p><p>2. Introduction Section:</p><p>The introduction provides a good overview of the problem, but it would benefit from a more explicit explanation of how the proposed method improves upon existing approaches. Perhaps adding a sentence comparing it to the state-of-the-art in threat modeling or misuse case analysis could help readers better understand the novelty and importance of your work.</p><p>Response:</p><p>The introduction section has been updated to include a clear statement emphasizing the novelty of the proposed AFMUC approach. A comparative sentence has been added to highlight how it improves upon existing misuse case analysis methods. This enhancement provides readers with a better understanding of the contribution and relevance of our work in relation to the state-of-the-art misuse case approach.</p><p>Additionally, a comprehensive comparison of AFMUC with other state-of-the-art threat modelling approaches and existing misuse case approached has been included in the Discussion section. This comparison is structured into three focused sub-parts:</p><p>i. Comparison with existing (mis)use case approaches,</p><p>ii. Comparison with UML- profile based approaches, and</p><p>iii. Comparison with traditional threat modeling approaches.</p><p>These comparisons provide a critical evaluation of how AFMUC improves upon and differs from existing approaches, enhancing the clarity and relevance of our contribution. The integration of this content ensures that readers and reviewers can better appreciate the scope, innovation, and impact of our work.</p><p>3. Motivation and Justification:</p><p>While the motivations for using aspect-oriented modeling are explained, it could be useful to include a more detailed justification of why misuse cases specifically are an appropriate vehicle for specifying security threats in comparison to other threat modeling techniques.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We have revised the &#8220;Introduction&#8221; section to include a justification for using the misuse case as threat modelling approach to model security threats. Specifically, we now explain the rationale for selecting misuse cases over other threat modeling techniques such as STRIDE, DREAD, and others. The added citation numbers are [4] [5].</p><p>To support this revision, we have cited three relevant and recent studies:</p><p>&#8226; A practitioner survey: "Security in Agile Software Development: A Practitioner Survey" (2021), and</p><p>&#8226; A systematic literature review: "A Systematic Review and Analytical Evaluation of Security Requirements Engineering Approaches" (2019).</p><p>&#8226; Comparative study &#8220;A Comparative Analysis of Threat Modelling Methods: STRIDE, DREAD, VAST, PASTA, OCTAVE, and LINDDUN,&#8221; (2024)</p><p>These studies reinforce the selection of misuse case by demonstrating that it remains one of the most widely adopted techniques by both researchers and practitioners. The cited literature highlights its advantages in simplicity, ease of use, and effectiveness in identifying security threats alongside functional requirements, making it particularly suitable for early analysis of security.</p><p>The references have been incorporated into the manuscript, and the relevant sentence in the &#8220;Introduction&#8221; section now explicitly connects this justification to the broader context of threat modelling.</p><p>4. Methodology Section:</p><p>The methodology section could be expanded to provide more examples or case studies to illustrate how your approach can be applied to real-world security scenarios.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer&#8217;s suggestion to expand the methodology section by providing more examples or case studies to illustrate the practical application of our approach. In the current version of the manuscript, we have presented two case studies to exemplify, verify, and validate the proposed AFMUC approach:</p><p>1. EU-Rent Car Rental System &#8211; a well-established, commonly used academic case study that allows for standardized demonstration of modeling approaches. (exemplify)</p><p>2. Mobile Financing Application &#8211; a real-world industrial project obtained through collaboration with an industry partner, used to assess the practical applicability of our proposed approach. (verification and validation)</p><p>To address the reviewer&#8217;s comment more explicitly, we have revised the &#8220;Future Work&#8221; section to emphasize the importance of further empirical evaluation. We now include a statement highlighting our intention to apply AFMUC to additional case studies and real-world applications in diverse domains to further validate its scalability, adaptability, and effectiveness in various security-critical applications.</p><p>We hope this update sufficiently addresses the reviewer&#8217;s concern and demonstrates our commitment to ongoing evaluation of the proposed methodology.</p><p>5. It would be useful to include a brief comparison of the proposed approach with traditional threat modeling techniques like STRIDE or DREAD to highlight its unique contributions.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We have expanded the &#8220;Discussion&#8221; section of the manuscript to include a more detailed comparative analysis. Specifically, we introduced three dedicated subheadings:</p><p>1. Comparison with existing (mis)use case approaches</p><p>2. Comparison with UML- profile based approaches</p><p>3. Comparison with traditional threat modeling approaches</p><p>Under the third subheading, we present a focused comparison of AFMUC with traditional threat modeling approaches such as STRIDE, DREAD, and Attack Trees. This comparison highlights the unique contributions of AFMUC, particularly its ability to integrate security concerns directly with functional requirements and to support behavioral modeling in a unified manner.</p><p>We believe this extended discussion significantly enhances the manuscript by more clearly positioning AFMUC within the broader context of security modeling methods and its added value over traditional threat modelling approaches.</p><p>To support the comparison, the added citations are</p><p>6. Figures and Diagrams:</p><p>The diagrams illustrating the aspect-oriented misuse cases are very helpful, but some of them might benefit from additional labeling or annotations to make them easier to follow for readers less familiar with this modeling technique.</p><p>In Figure X, it might be helpful to add more context or a legend to explain the relationships between the components, especially for readers unfamiliar with the specifics of aspect-oriented programming or misuse case methodology.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We have carefully reviewed and revised Figures 1, 6, 7, 8, and 10, which illustrate the proposed approach and the aspect-oriented misuse cases. To improve comprehension, we have added additional labels, annotations, and visual cues where necessary to clarify the relationships between components. These enhancements are intended to make the diagrams more accessible and informative, particularly for readers who may be less familiar with aspect-oriented programming or misuse case modeling. We believe these improvements significantly contribute to the overall clarity of the manuscript.</p><p>7. Results and Discussion: The results presented are interesting, but the paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed approach. Are there any scenarios where it might not be suitable?</p><p>Response:</p><p>We have added a dedicated subsection titled "Limitations" under the &#8220;Discussion&#8221; section of the revised manuscript. This subsection offers a clear and balanced analysis of the potential constraints and scenarios where the proposed AFMUC approach may encounter challenges or may not be suitable.</p><p>8. The paper could also discuss how the framework can be adapted or scaled for different types of applications, particularly when dealing with complex or large systems.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We have expanded the &#8220;Discussion&#8221; section of the revised manuscript to explicitly address the scalability and adaptability of the proposed AFMUC approach. This addition outlines how the proposed approach can be adapted to various types of applications, including complex and large-scale systems, and emphasizes its potential to support security modeling across diverse security-critical domains.</p><p>9. Related Work:</p><p>The related work section is comprehensive, but it would be helpful to briefly mention recent advancements in the integration of security in aspect-oriented programming (AOP) or misuse case approaches, to situate the work in the broader academic landscape.</p><p>Response</p><p>We have updated the &#8220;Related Work&#8221; section to incorporate recent advancement in integration of security in aspect-oriented programming (AOP) with various UML diagrams, including Aspect-Oriented Sequence Diagrams (Mal sequence) and AspectSM. The added citation numbers are [11] [12] [13].</p><p>While these works highlight the application of AOP in different modeling contexts, we did not find any recent or single study that specifically addresses the integration of AOP with misuse cases. This gap further reinforces the novelty of our proposed AFMUC approach and justifies the need to explore AOP integration in misuse case modeling.</p><p>The following related work has been referenced to demonstrate relevant contributions in the field:</p><p>&#8226; &#8220;Does aspect-oriented modeling help improve the readability of UML state machines?&#8221; (2014).- [12]</p><p>&#8226; &#8220;Modeling and verification of authentication threats mitigation in aspect-oriented mal sequence woven model&#8221; (2022)- [13]</p><p>To validate this claim, we have already cited [11] a recent systematic mapping study titled:</p><p>&#8220;On the Coverage of Aspect-Oriented Methodologies for the Early Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle&#8221;, published in 2022.</p><p>It supports our observation and provides a broader overview of current trends and gaps in AOP-based modeling. These additions not only strengthen the foundation of our work but also strengthen the contribu</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0322664.s006" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers updated.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0322664.s006.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0322664.r005" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0322664.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Lu</surname><given-names initials="Y">Yanrong</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Yanrong Lu</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Yanrong Lu</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0322664" id="rel-obj005" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
