It is the sixth most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is one of the most effective locoregional treatment approaches for unresectable HCC. Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) guideline currently recommends TACE as the first-line treatment for intermediate-stage HCC<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. However, intermediate-stage HCC patients represent a highly heterogeneous group, with substantial variability in tumor burden and liver function reserve[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The 2022 BCLC guideline further recommends systematic therapy, such as Tecentriq plus Avastin (T&#160;+&#160;A), for BCLC stage B infiltrative HCC, a distinct radiologic pattern, aligning with treatment strategies for advanced HCC[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, predicting the prognosis of intermediate-stage HCC patients undergoing TACE remains a significant challenge in clinical practice.</p><p>Previously, several prognostic scoring systems were used to predict the prognosis of intermediate-stage HCC<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. For example, Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> developed a prognostic score presented as the sum of tumor size and number for recommended TACE candidates with HCC, which can stratify patients into 3 prognostic strata with cut-offs of 6 and 12[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of this model for 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival were 0.73, 0.69, and 0.65[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, body composition assessment parameters have been identified as potential biomarkers for prognosis prediction in HCC patients undergoing TACE[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The hepatoma arterial-embolisation (HAP) score calculated by summing points including albumin, bilirubin, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and size of dominant tumor, derived from HCC patients undergoing TACE, is also a reliable survival predictor[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Cappelli <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> further reported the mHAP-III model, which used continuous variables such as tumor number, serum albumin, total bilirubin, AFP, and maximum tumor size to predict individual patient outcomes for those receiving TACE, and this model was regarded as a better prognostic predictive tool outperforming HAP[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The STATE and START scores have also proven useful in identifying candidates for TACE[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this case, C-reactive protein was required, but it was not routinely measured in many hospitals. Nevertheless, these studies are limited by a restricted number of clinical factors for model development or small sample sizes.</p><p>Our team reported that machine-learning (ML)-based models have helped physicians accurately predict the prognosis of HCC patients receiving intra-arterial therapies and perform risk stratification<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. However, the collection of much clinical information relies on manual or semi-automatic procedures, which are time-consuming and inefficient for routine clinical practice.</p><p>To date, no noninvasive, automated, and accurate ML model has been developed to assist physicians in decision-making for TACE treatment in intermediate-stage HCC. The novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm enables the automated and quantitative analysis of data from electronic medical records, radiology reports, and laboratory checklists. This study aimed to use a fully automated AI-based approach for collecting clinical data. Based on this approach, we developed and validated automated ML models to predict HCC-related death in intermediate-stage HCC patients undergoing TACE, aiming to guide physicians in therapeutic decision-making.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This retrospective, multi-institutional study was conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in the 2013 Declaration of Helsinki and the 2018 Declaration of Istanbul.

Recurrent neural networks were adopted as the basic algorithm for the post-structuring transformation of electronic medical records (Supplemental Digital Content, Fig. S1, available at: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/JS9/E390" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/JS9/E390</ext-link>).</p><p>A total of 23 preoperative variables were collected to build the ML models, including age, gender, BMI, pathological classification, comorbidities, etiology including hepatitis B virus (HBV), cirrhosis, ascites, maximum diameter of tumor (tumor size), tumor number, platelet count, serum levels of albumin, bilirubin, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, neutrophil, lymphocyte, AFP, and des-&#947;-carboxy prothrombin (DCP).

Six representative supervised ML algorithms (XGBoost, CatBoost, GBDT, LGBM, LR, and RF) were analyzed and compared. Random hyperparameter search and nested cross-validation were applied to optimize model performance and reduce overfitting (Supplemental Digital Content, E1.4, available at: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/JS9/E390" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/JS9/E390</ext-link>). The optimal ML model was trained using all clinical data, with features ranked by importance. Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation was performed to determine the optimal number of input features for predicting 2-year HCC-related death. For instance, the three least important features were removed, and the model was retrained using the remaining variables. To interpret the causal relationship of the ML model, the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to explain its predictive outcomes<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>.

</p></sec><sec><title>Data extraction from medical records</title><p>Twenty variables were automatically extracted from electronic medical records, radiology reports, and laboratory checklists using the NLP approach. Two independent radiologists (C.A. and B.Z.) verified all clinical information, with an ICC of 0.95. Among the 20 variables, the accuracy of automatic extraction of age, gender, tumor size, HBV, comorbidity, ascites, and all laboratory findings was excellent across the three cohorts (kappa values &gt; 0.9). The remaining clinical data were reorganized by the two physicians. A heatmap of features was generated from the correlation matrix of the 20 risk factors, derived from the correlation analysis (Supplemental Digital Content, Fig. S2, available at: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/JS9/E390" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/JS9/E390</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of the predictive performance of the ML models</title><p>Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents the training cohort-AUC, NPV, PPV, sensitivity, specificity, and <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>1 score of each ML model based on clinical variables for predicting 2-year HCC-related death.

Therefore, we developed an ML model to assist physicians in managing cTACE. This study offers several notable strengths and innovations. First, the ML model was developed using a large dataset of 2667 intermediate-stage HCC patients, with external validation involving data from six hospitals and a long median follow-up period of 32.9&#160;months. This ensures that the proposed ML model achieves comprehensiveness, robustness, and accuracy from multiple perspectives. Second, we employed an NLP method to automatically extract 23 clinical variables from medical records prior to TACE, enhancing the efficiency of data collection and model development. Third, we compared the performance of six representative ML models and identified XGBoost as the best-performing model. The XGBoost model, using seven key variables as input, was chosen for prognostic risk stratification prior to TACE. Fourth, the XGBoost model demonstrated significantly better predictive performance compared to other clinical markers and internationally recognized biomarkers in clinical trials.</p><p>In this study, the seven input variables of the XGBoost model can be classified into three categories: three tumor characteristics (AFP, size, and number), three liver function-related factors (ALB, AST, and PLT), and one metabolic factor (neutrophil). The three tumor characteristics were strongly associated with HCC invasiveness and poor prognosis following TACE due to recurrence. Tumor size and number are also key factors in the clinical staging of HCC. Serum ALB and AST have been identified as two independent risk factors for hepatic decompensation following TACE in a previous study, with hepatic decompensation being a major contributor to the death of HCC patients[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The ML algorithm has often been viewed as a &#8220;black box&#8221; due to its limited interpretability of risk indicators, which can cause reluctance among interventional radiologists to adopt it because of its lack of transparency in medical decision-making. To address this limitation, we applied SHAP values to predict HCC-related death, as follows: first, the SHAP method provides a global explanation that interprets the overall functionality of the XGBoost model; second, the SHAP method provides a local explanation for individual patients who underwent TACE, using their clinical data to detail how specific predictions of HCC-related death are made. Seven risk variables for HCC-related death were identified and ranked, with their relationships to HCC-related death explained using SHAP values in the XGBoost model. For example, tumor size and number are key imaging features, showing significant differences in SHAP values for predicting the risk of HCC-related death in patients who underwent TACE. This finding suggests that a higher tumor burden is more likely to lead to death due to tumor progression, compared to a lower tumor burden. AFP is also used as a tumor marker for predicting HCC-related death and is a more reliable indicator than DCP, as it has a higher SHAP value.</p><p>Although a large number of multidimensional features provide valuable information for the ML model, interference among variables and challenges in data collection may limit its performance and applicability. The XGBoost model efficiently classifies HCC patients into subgroups based on varying HCC-related death risk levels, helping to identify the most suitable candidates for TACE. In the training cohort, 33.4% of HCC patients were classified as high-risk, with a 5-year HCC-related death rate of 65.8%. In contrast, the low-risk group (66.6% of patients) had a 5-year HCC-related death rate of only 10%. The XGBoost model should be used as a web tool, which is clinically significant because it helps identify a subset of TACE-treated patients at high risk of death, who may still benefit from targeted management. For example, preventative targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and a more frequent monitoring strategy could be applied to improve clinical outcomes. Attributed to EHR compatibility and limitations in computing data sources, the challenges of device application still exist. Therefore, the preoperative plans for user-friendly interfaces (e.g., web-based tools) would add clinical practical value.</p><p>TACE-MWA is indicated for early- and intermediate-stage HCC. In clinical practice, several HCC patients with objective responses to TACE are eligible for TACE-MWA, with selection criteria following the Chinese Expert Consensus on Conversion Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Due to the high heterogeneity of intermediate-stage HCC, TACE alone is suboptimal for some patients, and the strategy of TACE sequentially combined with MWA is commonly used to achieve a no evidence of disease status. Therefore, identifying patients who may benefit from TACE-MWA treatment is crucial. Importantly, an improved CRS rate was observed for TACE-MWA in high-risk patients, but not in low-risk patients, based on prognostic risk stratification using the XGBoost model. These results suggest that the XGBoost model could aid decision-making prior to TACE, helping select individualized conversion therapy.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, the study was conducted in China. Therefore, the model&#8217;s applicability across different demographic groups, including different racial or ethnic groups, should be further validated. Second, patients were recruited from seven hospitals, each with distinct treatment practices and surgical techniques. Additionally, variations in the choice of TACE medications could have impacted the results. Moreover, the study predominantly included HCC patients with HBV infection, the primary cause of HCC in China. It remains uncertain whether these findings are applicable to Western countries, where most patients have fewer tumors or where alcoholic liver cirrhosis is the predominant cause. Finally, given the significance of HCC radiomics in predicting the prognosis of patients who have undergone TACE, we recommend incorporating it into our proposed ML model in future studies. Given these limitations, the application of our proposed XGBoost model as a decision support tool in prospective clinical trials needs further validation.</p><p>In summary, we developed an XGBoost model that can provide precise and rational strategies for patients with HCC at the BCLC B stage, both before TACE and during the subsequent monitoring period. These strategies are easily accessible online, considering the performance and interpretability of ML models.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FT0001"><label>
