Introduction</title><p>Coal mining, while economically critical, causes irreversible damage to fragile ecosystems, particularly in regions rich in coal reserves. Xinjiang, China, is home to the nation&#8217;s largest coal deposits and open-pit mining operations, which have led to widespread loss of surface vegetation, soil degradation, and water pollution [<xref rid="B1-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Traditional reclamation techniques often fail to address the dual challenges posed by extreme climates and Saline&#8211;alkali soil environment in arid regions. There is an urgent need to develop efficient, low-cost materials for environmental remediation [<xref rid="B5-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Water-retaining agents stand out among environmental remediation materials owing to their outstanding water-holding capacity and nutrient retention properties, making them essential for both soil structure amelioration and vegetation rehabilitation. In particular, superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) offer potential through water retention and soil conditioning, yet current variants face three critical limitations: (1) performance degradation in saline&#8211;alkali soil environment, (2) complex synthesis, and (3) poor ecological compatibility. These shortcomings hinder their large-scale application in coal mining regions. There is a pressing need for a new type of water-retaining agent that offers high salt tolerance, strong water retention, and environmental sustainability.</p><p>The development of water-retaining agents has evolved from the toxic starch-grafted acrylonitrile polymers in the early 1960s [<xref rid="B6-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] to the optimized polyacrylic acid-based materials in the early 2000s [<xref rid="B10-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As a result, salt resistance and environmental compatibility have gradually improved [<xref rid="B11-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, unresolved challenges persist, limiting their real-world applicability. The difficulties are as follows: 1. Many water absorption performance tests typically use deionized water, which cannot reflect complex saline ion environments. 2. Conventional synthesis methods often rely on reverse-phase suspension techniques, which demand intensive post-treatments [<xref rid="B15-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. 3. Natural SAPs exhibit low absorption, while synthetics resist degradation and risk secondary pollution. Critically, salt tolerance often compromises water retention capacity. This study introduces a facile &#8220;humic acid&#8211;polyacrylic acid composite modification&#8221; strategy, offering innovations in both material design and application scenarios. To address the balance between salt tolerance, water retention and ecological compatibility, humic acid was chosen as the key additive owing to its abundant carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups. This modification enables synergistic hydrogen bonding and ion crosslinking with polyacrylic acid, enhancing salt tolerance, gel stability, and soil fertility. A simplified one-step aqueous polymerization optimizes monomer ratios and crosslinking density, simplifying the synthesis process and reducing costs. Finally, Performance was quantified under realistic mining ion conditions, and a &#8220;material&#8211;soil&#8211;vegetation&#8221; restoration system was established via drought-resistant plant trials. By addressing the core constraints of arid mining restoration, we hope this composite polymer will offer a novel technical approach for rehabilitating degraded ecosystems.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-polymers-17-02268"><title>2.

Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec3dot1-polymers-17-02268"><title>3.1. Optimization of the Optimal Ratio of Each Material and Reaction System</title><p>This study systematically investigated the key parameters influencing the swelling performance of sodium carboxymethylcellulose&#8211;acrylic acid&#8211;polyacrylamide&#8211;humic acid (CMC-AA-AM-HA) composite water-retaining agent. Six critical factors were examined: (1) reaction temperature, (2) acrylic acid neutralization degree, (3) N,N&#8217;-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) crosslinker concentration, (4) ammonium persulfate (APS) initiator dosage, (5) humic acid (HA) content, and (6) AM dosage. Through controlled experiments, we identified optimal conditions that maximize the water absorption capacity while maintaining desirable structural integrity of the superabsorbent polymer network.</p><sec id="sec3dot1dot1-polymers-17-02268"><title>3.1.1. Effect of Temperature on the Water Absorption Rate of Superabsorbent Resins</title><p>Under controlled synthesis conditions (75% acrylic acid neutralization, mass ratios w(AA):w(CMC):w(HA):w(AM):w(MBA):w(APS) = 100:15:4.5:25:0.6:0.8), the water absorption capacity demonstrated a temperature-dependent optimum, peaking at 70 &#176;C (<xref rid="polymers-17-02268-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Below 65 &#176;C, reduced initiator activity led to insufficient radical generation and slow polymerization, yielding weakly crosslinked networks with increased soluble fractions and poor mechanical strength. The 70 &#176;C optimum balanced radical production and reaction kinetics, forming an effective three-dimensional network. However, temperatures exceeding 70 &#176;C caused (1) excessive initiator decomposition rates producing low-molecular-weight polymers with shortened backbones, (2) decreased crosslinking density, and (3) potential thermal runaway due to accelerated exothermic polymerization, ultimately resulting in viscous, low-strength products with compromised water absorption performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot2-polymers-17-02268"><title>3.1.2. Effect of MBA on the Water Absorption Rate of Superabsorbent Resins</title><p>Under controlled synthesis conditions (75% acrylic acid neutralization, 70 &#176;C reaction temperature, and mass ratios w(AA):w(CMC):w(HA):w(AM):w(APS) = 100:15:4.5:25:0.8), the water absorption performance exhibited a non-monotonic dependence on MBA crosslinker content, reaching maximum absorption at 0.6% MBA dosage (<xref rid="polymers-17-02268-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs), as functional polymeric materials with moderately crosslinked structures, demonstrate a significant correlation between swelling performance and crosslinking network density. Research indicates that optimal control of crosslinker content is crucial: insufficient crosslinking fails to establish a complete three-dimensional crosslinked network structure, leading to increased soluble component ratios and consequently reduced water absorption capacity, whereas excessive crosslinking significantly enhances the rigidity of the polymer network, not only constraining the elastic deformation capacity of molecular chains but also substantially diminishing the hydration space volume of the network structure, ultimately resulting in decreased water absorption performance of the resin.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot3-polymers-17-02268"><title>3.1.3. Effect of APS Dosage on Water Absorption of Superabsorbent Resins</title><p>Under controlled synthesis conditions (75% acrylic acid neutralization, 70 &#176;C reaction temperature, and mass ratios w(AA):w(CMC):w(HA):w(AM):w(MBA) = 100:15:4.5:25:0.6), the water absorption capacity demonstrated a pronounced dependence on APS initiator dosage, exhibiting an initial increase followed by a decrease (<xref rid="polymers-17-02268-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This optimal behavior arises from competing radical-mediated mechanisms: (1) at low APS concentrations (&lt;0.8%), insufficient radical generation leads to incomplete network formation and increased soluble fractions, while (2) excessive APS (&gt;0.8%) produces radical overpopulation that accelerates termination reactions, reducing polymer molecular weight and creating excessive crosslinking that constrains the three-dimensional network architecture. The balanced condition (0.8% APS) achieves the optimal radical concentration for forming an effective porous network that maximizes water absorption.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot4-polymers-17-02268"><title>3.1.4. Effect of Neutralization Degree on Water Absorption Rate of Resin</title><p>Under controlled reaction conditions (70 &#176;C, mass ratios w(AA):w(CMC):w(HA):w(AM):w(MBA):w(APS) = 100:15:4.5:25:0.6:0.8), the influence of neutralization degree on the water absorption capacity of superabsorbent resin was systematically investigated. As presented in <xref rid="polymers-17-02268-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, the water absorption performance exhibited a distinct maximum at 75% neutralization degree, demonstrating an initial increase followed by a gradual decrease with further neutralization.</p><p>This optimal behavior can be explained by two competing mechanisms: At low neutralization degrees (&lt;75%), the high reactivity of acrylic acid monomers leads to uncontrolled copolymerization and homopolymerization tendencies, while the insufficient ionic groups result in low osmotic pressure and, consequently, reduced water absorption. When excessive neutralization occurs (&gt;75%), the decreased reactivity of sodium acrylate (CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCOONa) compared to acrylic acid (CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCOOH) slows down the grafting reaction rate and reduces crosslinking density, ultimately increasing the soluble fraction and compromising the water absorption capacity.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot5-polymers-17-02268"><title>3.1.5. Effect of HA Dosage on Water Absorption of Superabsorbent Resin</title><p>Under controlled synthesis conditions (75% neutralization degree of acrylic acid, 70 &#176;C reaction temperature, mass ratios w(AA):w(CMC):w(AM):w(MBA):w(APS) = 100:15:25:0.6:0.8), the influence of HA content on the water absorption properties of superabsorbent resin was systematically evaluated. As depicted in <xref rid="polymers-17-02268-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, the water absorption capacity demonstrated a characteristic initial enhancement followed by a subsequent reduction as the HA dosage increased. This non-monotonic behavior originates from the dual functionality of HA: at optimal concentrations, its abundant carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amino groups participate in crosslinking reactions with AM and CMC to enhance network performance, whereas excessive HA leads to incomplete dissolution and physical entrapment within the polymer matrix, consequently disrupting osmotic equilibrium and diminishing absorption efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot6-polymers-17-02268"><title>3.1.6. Effect of AM Dosage on Water Absorption Rate of Superabsorbent Resins</title><p>Under controlled synthesis conditions (75% acrylic acid neutralization degree, 70 &#176;C reaction temperature, mass ratios of w(AA):w(CMC):w(MBA):w(APS) = 100%:15%:0.6%:0.8%), the influence of AM dosage on the water absorption capacity of the superabsorbent resin was systematically investigated. As illustrated in <xref rid="polymers-17-02268-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, the resin&#8217;s water absorption exhibited a distinct volcano-shaped trend with increasing AM content, reaching maximum absorption at 25% AM loading. This optimal performance arises from the synergistic effects between AM&#8217;s nonionic -CONH<sub>2</sub> groups and the existing -COOH/-OH groups, which collectively enhance hydrophilicity. However, excessive AM content (&gt;25%) leads to reduced absorption capacity because (1) the -CONH<sub>2</sub> group demonstrates inferior water affinity compared to -COOH, and (2) the hydrophobic character of -CONH<sub>2</sub> becomes dominant at higher concentrations, thereby compromising the overall water absorption performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-polymers-17-02268"><title>3.2.

This thermal response indicates that (1) the resin&#8217;s crosslinked network maintains superior structural stability under low-temperature conditions while (2) retaining measurable water adsorption capacity even at elevated temperatures. Comparative analysis revealed substantially faster water evaporation rates at 60 &#176;C versus 30 &#176;C, and this was attributable to two primary mechanisms: (i) enhanced molecular thermal motion facilitating free water evaporation, and (ii) disruption of hydrogen bonding networks that normally stabilize water molecules within the polymer matrix.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot2-polymers-17-02268"><title>3.2.2.

This deterioration primarily stems from progressive damage to the crosslinked network during repeated hydration&#8211;dehydration processes, manifested through two mechanisms: (1) mechanical degradation of the crosslinked structure compromising three-dimensional network integrity, and (2) weakened elastic recovery of polymer chains, impairing the resin&#8217;s ability to maintain its original swollen state.

Water Absorption in Different Salt Solutions</title><p>In the selection of metal ions, sodium chloride (NaCl) serves as the primary component of soil salinization in arid mining areas and is commonly used to simulate saline&#8211;alkali environments. Calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) represents ubiquitous hardness ions in soil, while ferric chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>) was chosen to investigate the unique effects of high-valence ions (with iron-rich wastewater frequently occurring in acid mine drainage). Therefore, these three ions were selected for testing.</p><p><xref rid="polymers-17-02268-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> demonstrates that the resin&#8217;s water absorption capacity in various salt solutions exhibited significant concentration-dependent behavior. The experimental results revealed a marked decrease in both equilibrium swelling and water absorption capacity with increasing salt concentration. This trend was most pronounced in NaCl solution, where the absorption rate dramatically declined from 148 g/g to 46 g/g as the NaCl concentration increased from 0.01 mol/L to 0.15 mol/L. The swelling inhibition mechanism primarily involves (1) reduced osmotic pressure gradient across the resin network, and (2) complexation of high-valence metal ions with carboxylic acid groups, leading to network contraction and a consequent reduction in liquid retention capacity.</p><p>Furthermore, the resin&#8217;s absorption performance showed an inverse relationship with metal ion valence. At equivalent concentrations, the absorption capacity followed the order NaCl &gt; CaCl<sub>2</sub> &gt; FeCl<sub>3</sub>. This phenomenon arose because higher-valence cations (e.g., Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>) exhibit stronger charge screening effects, more effectively neutralizing ionized groups within the resin and thus suppressing its swelling capacity.</p><p>This study elucidates that resin water absorption in saline environments is governed by multiple interrelated factors, including solution concentration, resin chemical architecture, and metal ion properties. A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing resin applications in wastewater treatment, ion exchange processes, and membrane separation technologies.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot5-polymers-17-02268"><title>3.2.5.

The Potential Mechanism of HA-CMC Interactions with Soil&#8211;Plant System</title><p>The incorporation of resin significantly improves soil&#8217;s structure by increasing porosity and enhancing permeability. As the SAP content increases, a notable reduction in soil bulk density is observed, attributable to the swollen resin forming a porous matrix that expands soil pore spaces. This structural modification not only facilitates gas exchange but also stimulates microbial activity, consequently elevating soil organic matter content. Furthermore, the HA component in HA-CMC demonstrates a sustained-release behavior during swelling, gradually releasing humic acid into the soil matrix. This dual function enhances soil fertility through continuous organic matter supplementation while simultaneously improving both physical (e.g., aeration, water retention) and chemical (e.g., nutrient availability) properties of the soil, thereby creating an optimized growth environment for plants. The slow-release mechanism ensures long-term nutrient supply for plant development while maintaining improved soil physicochemical characteristics [<xref rid="B18-polymers-17-02268" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-polymers-17-02268"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we introduce a facile method to develop a humic acid&#8211;carboxymethyl cellulose composite superabsorbent polymer (HA-CMC) for ecological restoration in arid coal-mining regions. Integration of humic acid (HA) enabled both hydrogen bonding and ion crosslinking with the polyacrylic acid network, significantly enhancing salt tolerance (retaining &gt; 90% water absorption in 0.9 wt% NaCl solution), gel stability, and soil organic content. A one-step aqueous polymerization process with optimized monomer ratios simplified production, reduced costs, and ensured scalability. Under real mining-area conditions, HA-CMC demonstrated excellent water retention capacity, boosting surface vegetation coverage by 40&#8211;60%, establishing a functional &#8220;material&#8211;soil&#8211;vegetation&#8221; restoration system. These results confirm that HA-CMC is a transformative solution for sustainable mining remediation, effectively resolving the trade-offs between salt tolerance, water retention, cost, and eco-compatibility that plague existing technologies. Future work will focus on large-scale deployment and long-term soil health monitoring.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful the financial supports from Key Research and Development Program of Xinjiang Autonomous Region (No. 2022B02031-1).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
