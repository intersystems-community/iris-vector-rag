Various psychological, physiological, and environmental factors may drive high consumption of SSF. Due to blocking sweet tastes, the herb Gymnema sylvestre (GS) has been shown to reduce SSF consumption, but its impact on motivation to eat SSF is unknown. This research aimed to qualitatively investigate adults&#8217; perceptions regarding effects of GS on their motivation to eat SSF when administered systematically (three times/day in-between meals, i.e., GS-SYS treatment) or ad libitum (up to six times/day at participants&#8217; discretion, i.e., GS-ADLIB) over 14 days, compared to placebo (taste-matched mint; PLAC-SYS). <bold>Methods:</bold> This study represents the qualitative investigation of a placebo-controlled randomised cross-over trial, conducted as three 14-day phases. The qualitative investigation included interviews at baseline and three post-testing phases. Seven participants (mean age 34.7 &#177; 13.8 years; two males, five females) agreed to participate. Twenty-eight interviews (across phases) were thematically analysed using NVivo software, identifying themes and highlighting changes in motivation to eat SSFs across the study. <bold>Results:</bold> The GS-SYS and GS-ADLIB treatments made SSFs unpleasant to eat and increased mindful eating, subsequently increasing motivation to avoid SSFs. External factors could increase or decrease motivation, depending on individual circumstances. Participants preferred GS-SYS and GS-ADLIB over PLAC-SYS, feeling it was more effective at changing behaviours related to SSF intake. Self-control over SSF intake changed during the study, mostly due to external factors, and in part GS-ADLIB. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: Participants found both GS administrations successful as motivation to avoid SSF; GS-ADLIB was considered most effective.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Gurmar</kwd><kwd>impulse</kwd><kwd>sugar-sweetened</kwd><kwd>behaviour</kwd><kwd>mindful eating</kwd><kwd>pleasant</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.

Introduction</title><p>High intake of energy-dense foods, including sugar-sweetened foods (SSFs), promote obesity, defined as excess body fat, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Daily sugar intake of less than 10% of total energy intake is recommended for decreasing non-communicable disease risk; however, worldwide sugar intake still exceeds these recommendations [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Scrutiny of sugar-reduction initiatives, including sugar taxes, pharmaceuticals such as appetite suppressants, and dietary sugar restriction, suggests that these initiatives may yield only partial results in reducing motivation to consume SSF [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Motivation to eat SSFs may have prehistoric origins, when energy was scarce and sweetness signalled valuable energy-dense foods [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Today&#8217;s developed nations rarely face survival-threatening famine, but urbanisation rates exceed the ability of human genomes to adapt concurrently, so preferences for sweet foods persist [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Motives for eating SSFs can have physiological, psychological, or external origins [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Having a &#8216;sweet tooth&#8217; has been shown to increase pleasure derived from SSF and could increase risks associated with the negative side-effects of high sugar intake [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, whether having a sweet tooth does increase the risk of non-communicable disease development is unknown [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The herb Gymnema sylvestre (GS) blocks sweet tastes, with saponins (called Gymnemic acids (GAs)) which attach to sweet taste receptors to prevent sweetness perception [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Acutely administered GS has been shown to reduce pleasantness of, desire for, and total intake of SSFs [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Gastric emptying, glycaemic response, and appetite are not affected by GS [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Gymnemic acids have reduced activation of neural reward circuitry in response to anticipated tastes and actual tastes of a high-calorie milkshake [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Sugar cravings may be reduced by using GS, highlighting its potential to reduce body weight by decreasing SSF intake [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, those with a sweet tooth have exhibited larger decreases in pleasantness and desire for SSF with administration of GS, suggesting those with a sweet tooth are particularly sensitive to GS [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Studies investigating effects of GS on pleasantness of, desire for, total intake of SSF, as well as other outcomes related to SSF consumption have mostly used GS in acute doses, either once, twice, or seven times [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Turner et al. tested the effects of GS intake over 14 days, using a regimented administration of GS, with participants being instructed to take the supplement three times a day [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Testing GS over longer periods of time is more conducive to determining the applicability of the herb to settings outside a laboratory and therefore its use in day-to-day life. Turner et al. used GS in a systematic way; however, both the effects of ad libitum consumption and the impact on motivation to consume SSF should be investigated [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Ad libitum consumption is of particular interest as it may pose a more appropriate form of GS administration for individuals who want to curb acute sugar cravings. Several behaviour modification studies have already shown that ad libitum interventions may be more effective than a systematic approach, justifying investigation of this in GS administration [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the available evidence highlighting that current sugar-reduction initiatives are ineffective, there is also a dearth of evidence regarding the motivations to eat SSF and how GS may affect these motivations [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of GS administered over 14 days, both systematically (i.e., fixed administration three times a day) or ad libitum (i.e., administration up to six times a day at participants&#8217; discretion) relative to a placebo control condition, on the motivation to eat SSF in adults that self-identified as having a sweet tooth. This paper is part of a larger mixed-method study investigating the effect of consuming GS over 14 days on reducing sugar intake; here, we describe the qualitative outcomes of the project.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-17-02718"><title>2.

Participant Screening and Recruitment</title><p>This study reports the qualitative investigation of a single blind placebo-controlled randomised cross-over trial, conducted in three 14-day phases [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The randomised cross-over trial results have been previously reported [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

This qualitative investigation employed a mixed-methods approach, grounded in a pragmatist paradigm, and utilised a theme identification methodology to analyse data from open-ended interviews [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interviews were designed with a flexible structure to explore the effects of GS on participants&#8217; desire to consume SSF, changes in total SSF intake, and the associated motivation for consumption. The study adopted a phenomenological approach to examine participants&#8217; lived experiences and the meanings they attached to these changes [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Convenience sampling methods were used to select participants. All participants (adult males and females) were screened to have a sweet tooth, not be taking medications affecting smell or taste, and not have any health conditions. Specifically, people with Diabetes Mellitus were excluded as GS may cause hypoglycaemia [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. An eligibility screener using online software (Qualtrics Experience Management, Provo, UT, USA) determined potential participant eligibility. Sweet tooth status was assessed with the sugar addiction questionnaire and the Dutch eating behaviour questionnaire [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Eligible participants included those who scored &#8805;25 percentile in the sugar addiction and Dutch eating behaviour questionnaires, were 18&#8211;60 years old (to reduce effects of age-related taste and smell changes), had English as a spoken language, and were able to give written informed consent [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The study was conducted between July and October 2022 in the North Shore, Auckland, NZ, USA. Recruitment strategies included posters with scannable QR codes for access to screening tools. These were placed in public areas (e.g., caf&#233;, library) and posted on social media. From 192 individuals screened, 82 were deemed eligible to take part in the study and 32 were recruited into the trial [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This sample size was based on a G*Power (version 3.1.9.7) calculation suggesting approximately 30 participants would enable detection of changes in sweet taste preference, with an allowance for possible dropouts [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. All recruited participants were invited to participate in the qualitative study. Seven of the recruited participants (aged 22&#8211;55 years, mean age of 34.7 &#177; 13.8 years; two males and five females) accepted the invitation and completed four interviews (at baseline and then after each intervention period).

Study Design</title><p>The study design and process are presented in <xref rid="nutrients-17-02718-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Participants attended data collection appointments at the Massey University, Auckland campus. Participants underwent data collection at each of these visits, the details of which are not relevant to this study but are described by Hsiao et al. [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Details of the 3 arms of the trial are described to provide context for the qualitative exploration. Each 14-day testing period tested one treatment. Participants were led to believe they would be testing three different mints all containing different dosages of GS, and were blinded to the true study protocol. In reality, only two mints were used: one GS-containing mint and a placebo (identical to the GS-containing mints but excluding GS). Both were provided by Nu Brands Inc. (Los Angeles, CA, USA). All participants were treated with the placebo mint for the first 14 days systematically (PLAC-SYS): three times a day at mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and post-dinner. Participants were then randomly allocated to a treatment using a random number generator: systematic GS-treatment (GS-SYS) or ad libitum GS-treatment (GS-ADLIB). Allocated treatments were followed for 14 days, after which each participant crossed over to the other treatment for a final 14 days. The GS-SYS treatment involved taking GS mints in an identical manner to the PLAC-SYS protocol. The GS-ADLIB treatment involved taking GS mints ad libitum, or at the participants&#8217; discretion up to six times a day.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2dot3-nutrients-17-02718"><title>2.3.

Data Processing and Analysis</title><p>Interview recordings were auto-transcribed from interview software and checked for accuracy by the primary author (IN). All transcripts were de-identified and uploaded to NVivo (QSR International, Burlington,9 Massachusetts) for analysis. Audio recordings were deleted after transcription; transcripts were not returned to participants for comment. Thematic analysis was conducted using an inductive approach, consistent with the interpretive paradigm guiding this study. Coding was carried out by the first author, who began by reading each transcript multiple times to become familiar with the content. Initial codes were generated directly from the data, with attention to patterns and repeated concepts emerging from participants&#8217; experiences and reflections. These codes were then grouped into broader categories that captured commonalities across participants. As themes began to emerge, they were reviewed, refined, and named to reflect the underlying meaning of each grouping. Although the interview guide had identified key areas of interest (e.g., motivation to eat or avoid SSF, perceptions of the treatments), the themes developed from the data rather than being pre-determined.</p><p>Once overarching themes were established, NVivo was used to organise the data and explore patterns within and across participant responses. For organisational purposes, each participant&#8217;s interviews were grouped into four &#8216;cases&#8217; representing the four time points: (1) baseline; (2) PLAC-SYS; (3) GS-SYS; and (4) GS-ADLIB. These data should provide information on changes in motivation and self-reported behaviours across the intervention phases.</p><p>The final themes and sub-themes reflected both the topics explored in the interview guide and the inductive insights drawn from participants&#8217; narratives. These are presented in <xref rid="nutrients-17-02718-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-nutrients-17-02718"><title>3. Results</title><p>Participants described a range of motivations influencing their consumption or avoidance of SSFs, but in addition they also discussed influences that affected these motivations. They also reported on their opinions on the treatments and commented on their feelings of control of SSF intake with the various treatments. The following sections present the key themes identified in the analysis, supported by illustrative quotes. It should be noted that participants were not asked to provide any feedback on the following findings after they were written up by the authors.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-nutrients-17-02718"><title>3.1. Theme 1&#8212;External Influences Affecting SSF Intake</title><p>There were many external influences on the participants which were found to significantly affect their motivations to eat SSF. These influences arose from the environment the participants existed in and included factors such as the influence of external environmental factors like occupations and personal responsibilities and the influence of wanting to make a lifestyle change to achieve a better health outcome (e.g., lose body weight or improve health). These external influences were present at baseline, and throughout the study at every treatment phase. There were obviously, as well, the influence of the treatments (PLAC-SYS, GS-SYS, and GS-ADLIB) and the impact of these on the motivation to eat or avoid SSFs which the participants also reported on.</p><p>The decision to eat SSF was found to be non-linear, involving external influences on an individual which affect motivations (to eat or avoid SSF) and therefore actual intake of SSF. This process could occur chronologically, with an external influence driving a motivation ultimately deciding SSF intake. The process could also occur in the opposite direction, and may occur in a way where influences or motivations work independently of each other to affect SSF intake.</p><p>At baseline, four of seven participants reported being influenced by conscious decisions to reduce SSF intake before even trying any treatment (i.e., they were influenced by lifestyle changes). These originated from desires to improve physical or mental health, or to change body weight. No participant used lifestyle changes to increase their intake of SSF.</p><disp-quote><p>

I&#8217;m like &#8220;oh, this does have a bit of sugar in it, probably shouldn&#8217;t have eaten that&#8221; or &#8220;nah, I don&#8217;t need that because I don&#8217;t need the sugar&#8221;.&#8217;</italic>

Stress often rose, motivating participants to eat out of emotion; or the physical food environments changed (i.e., access to SSF) to shift motivation. In addition, four participants reported that being in the trial itself focusing on SSF intake and health was influencing them to eat less SSF (i.e., classified as a lifestyle change).</p><disp-quote><p>

When discussing the effect of external influencers independently on SSF intake, participants reported how these could significantly affect emotions or access to food, which in turn would increase motivation to eat due to hunger or increased availability. Five participants were influenced by lifestyle changes (e.g., being in the trial or weight loss for the summer), which motivated them to eat less SSF.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#8216;Cutting down body fat percentage with Summer coming </italic>[motivated me to not eat SSF]. <italic toggle="yes">I want to look better.&#8217;</italic></p><attrib>(Participant 4)</attrib></disp-quote><p>With the use of GS-ADLIB, four participants were motivated to avoid SSFs as part of a lifestyle change due to health or weight concerns, independent of the treatments being used. Only one of these felt the trial itself influenced motivation to eat or avoid SSF. Most participants felt that external influences like occupations and related work trips or vacations were significant drivers of higher and lower intakes of SSFs. There were instances where trips away from home increased or decreased access to SSFs or contributed to stress and emotional eating.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-nutrients-17-02718"><title>3.2.

Psychological Motivations</title><p>Motivations to eat SSFs were identified by all participants throughout the different phases of the study, with participants eating SSFs out of boredom, stress, emotional triggers, or a general lack of mindfulness around eating. At baseline all participants identified that they ate SSFs due to being bored, out of positive (e.g., celebrating with SSF) or negative (e.g., out of sadness) emotions, or out of a general lack of mindfulness.</p><disp-quote><p>

</p><attrib>(Participant 3)</attrib></disp-quote><p>During the treatment phases, some key motivators for seeking SSFs were psychological (eating out of boredom, stress, emotional triggers, or due to eating mindlessly non-mindfully). However, several participants now described psychological motivation to avoid SSF, with these motivations being attributed to taking the treatments (both PLAC and GS treatments). Two participants thought PLAC-SYS decreased motivation to eat SSF because it promoted mindfulness, and one of these even felt they appreciated savoury flavours more with administration of PLAC-SYS.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#8216;I didn&#8217;t have as much as I&#8217;d normally have.

The treatment was taken as prescribed and when the anti-sweet effects elapsed, participants consider if they still wanted SSFs. This strategy allowed cravings to pass, and decreased the volume of SSF consumed.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#8216;You also know that the food you eat after it won&#8217;t be quite as satisfying.

Four of the seven participants discussed how GS-ADLIB psychologically motivated them to avoid SSFs by helping them assess their true want for SSFs (i.e., increased mindfulness).</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#8216;It was almost like a self-test. &#8230; How badly do I want this sweet thing?

</p><attrib>(Participant 5)</attrib></disp-quote><p>Overall, psychological motivations to eat SSFs&#8212;such as boredom, stress, and emotional triggers&#8212;were commonly identified throughout the study; and during the intervention phases, several participants described a shift toward greater mindfulness and reflective decision-making, particularly when using GS-ADLIB.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot2-nutrients-17-02718"><title>3.2.2. Habitual Motivations</title><p>Habits were another common driver of SSF intake.

External Motivations</title><p>All participants described external factors&#8212;such as work schedules, holidays, access to food, and social environments&#8212;as key influences on their motivations to consume SSFs throughout the study. These factors could either increase or decrease SSF intake, depending on the situation. In particular, occupations (i.e., working or studying) were significant drivers to eating or avoiding SSF, with six of the seven participants identifying these are influencers on SSF intake. For one participant working fulltime, sometimes there was less motivation, other times (for instance during meetings where SSFs were available) there was increased temptation to eat SSFs because they were easily accessible.</p><disp-quote><p>

Pleasure-Seeking Motivations</title><p>Pleasure and rewards were central to many participants&#8217; motivations for consuming SSFs, with the most identified motivation to eat SSF across the study being pleasure-seeking-related.

<italic toggle="yes">&#8216;Obviously like most people I end up eating more than you&#8217;d want to, it&#8217;s probably a bit of endorphins. The brain knows it tastes good, it gives you energy, once that you have it.&#8217;</italic>

During testing of PLAC-SYS six of the seven participants reported changes to motivations to avoid SSFs, reporting that PLAC-SYS motivated avoidance as using it made SSF taste unpleasant. This was directly attributed to CON-SYS by producing a minty after-taste, making SSFs unpalatable, being sufficiently sweet to satiate SSF desire, or reducing cravings for SSF directly.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#8216;It&#8217;s just that taste was so strong in my mouth, definitely it did have a negative effect.

Mindfulness and Behaviour Change</title><p>Motivation to avoid SSF was higher with GS treatments due to SSF being less palatable or enjoyable, which made them consciously decide that SSF intake was unnecessary. Both groups reported an increase in mindful eating, which involves using physiological cues rather than emotions to dictate food choice, which is a technique that has been used for treating eating disorders and obesity [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Because GS negatively affects pleasure from SSFs for 30&#8211;120 min, participants would heed satiety cues better during this time [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. After effects of GS elapsed, participants may have decided SSFs were not needed after all, despite initial high motivation to eat them. An additional aspect of being mindful (not just in relation to eating) is that many of its fundamentals are also foundations of the initial phases of the Transtheoretical Model, or Stages of Change Model, which is used to assess inclination for behaviour change [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

For participants in this study to achieve lower SSF intakes they likely used mindful eating to execute beneficial actions classically seen only in the fourth stage of &#8216;action&#8217;. Two participants also found using the PLAC-SYS increased their motivation to avoid SSF because of enhanced mindfulness. This indicates that mindful eating, with or without GS, could help reduce motivation to eat SSF. Mindful eating has had varying effects on SSF intake and has been linked to reduced confectionary intake and lower fasting blood glucose in obese adults over 12 months [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B39-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Short-term restrictive diets for weight loss are ineffective at changing body weight long-term, let alone producing long-term maintenance to low-sugar diets, which is one reason mindful eating may be a preferable intervention for long-term dietary change [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-nutrients-17-02718"><title>4.3. Gymnema Sylvestre and Taste-Driven Motivation</title><p>Participants also felt GS changed motivations by making SSFs taste unpleasant. Previous research found that GS significantly reduced pleasure derived from SSF [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Most of these studies also found GS reduced SSF intake [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Overall, research on relationships between having a sweet tooth and non-communicable disease development is limited. However, hypothetically, this group would benefit from interventions targeting SSF preferences as they have higher desire for these foods which are already associated with non-communicable disease risk [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Turner et al. and Turner et al. found that GS reduced pleasantness of and desire for chocolate to a greater degree in participants that had a sweet tooth compared to those that did not [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The present study supports these findings and provides novel evidence that the reason GS is more effective in those with a sweet tooth may be because the herb increases motivation to avoid SSF. Although GS reduced immediate motivation to eat SSFs due to reducing their palatability, some counteracted this problem by waiting for the effects of GS to elapse before eating SSFs or eating them at a different time of day. This points to the desire for SSFs overriding attempts to change behaviour. The stages of change model posits that individuals are only truly motivated to change behaviour in the fourth stage of &#8216;action&#8217;, when they are receptive to receiving and seeking support [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Further research into whether GS can provide a synergistic effect with mindfulness to help individuals move through stages of behavioural change successfully, is merited.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-nutrients-17-02718"><title>4.4. Influence of External Factors</title><p>External factors were found to significantly affect motivation to eat SSFs amongst the participants in this study, including individual experiences, circumstances, and environments, similar to those in previous studies [<xref rid="B42-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. &#8216;Food addiction&#8217; is controversial and not recognised by <italic toggle="yes">The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (DSM-5) [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Findings from drug- and alcohol-related research may therefore not be applicable to food overconsumption, which is not synonymous with addiction [<xref rid="B46-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Turner et al. likened nicotine patches for smoking cessation to using GS for SSF reduction, and proposed that when used over 14 days, GS can be used as a short-term tool (in addition to other behavioural modification programmes) to reduce habitual SSF intake and build awareness around SSF intakes [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The current study supports this hypothesis by showing that GS can be used to reduce SSF intake over 14 days through motivational change.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot5-nutrients-17-02718"><title>4.5. Treatment Preferences and Acceptability</title><p>The third main finding was that GS-SYS and GS-ADLIB were not only preferred more by participants than PLAC-SYS, but they were also reportedly more effective. Medication adherence may be lower if they are perceived negatively [<xref rid="B47-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Preference of the GS treatments indicate they may be perceived as effective interventions for reducing SSF intake by this study&#8217;s participants. Participants, in general, found GS-ADLIB a more successful treatment than GS-SYS. Individual preference of treatment administration may be a contributing factor as to why a clear preference was unindicated, possibly more so than the perceived dosages of the treatments [<xref rid="B47-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-nutrients-17-02718"><title>4.6. Self-Control and Intervention Design</title><p>The fourth main finding was the report of varied control levels over SSF intake across the study. Most participants did not feel control levels changed during the testing of PLAC-SYS, nor GS-SYS. The biggest changes were seen during the testing of GS-ADLIB, which may be attributable to external factors as well as GS-ADLIB. Self-control has been shown to significantly affect morbidity and mortality, and higher levels have been previously associated with higher intakes of fruits and vegetables, fewer instances of overeating, and being less likely to engage in behaviours that cause weight gain [<xref rid="B48-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Participants in the current study reported stress from external factors drove their motivation to eat SSF and lowered their self-control. Lifestyle interventions designed to improve dietary quality (e.g., lower SSF intake) should consider individual stressors and how these might override interventions, no matter how effective the interventions are. This study supports previous evidence indicating that GS does reduce intake of SSF, but it also highlights that external factors were contributors to participant self-control over SSF intake [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B52-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. As GS-ADLIB seemed to contribute to higher self-control, and similarly external factors seemed to be strong determinants of self-control, our study supports the proposal by Turner et al. that GS may be beneficial as part of larger lifestyle interventions, rather than used in isolation [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Additional measures (e.g., dietitian support, nutrition counselling, coaching) may be required in addition to GS to address these external factors and help increase the efficacy of GS treatments.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot7-nutrients-17-02718"><title>4.7. Strengths and Limitations</title><p>A strength of this study was the in-depth analysis into the effects of GS intake on motivation to eat SSFs using qualitative methods. Second, the health screening questionnaire was extremely detailed and excluded participants for an exhaustive number of health reasons. None of the participants had altered smell or taste perceptions, therefore not impacting on the consistency of responses to GS treatments. During the interview process, the first author (IN) had no pre-existing relationship with any of the study participants and endeavoured to remain neutral throughout interviews. She was a student dietitian at the time of data collection, and her student status may have encouraged trustworthiness and openness in participants during interviews. Participants were not informed of the interviewer&#8217;s personal goals or reasons for conducting the research, and no relationship was established prior to participation. No characteristics, biases, or assumptions were disclosed to participants during the study. On completion of the interviews, a software transcription service transcribed the audio recordings. The primary researcher (IN) then reviewed each transcript for accuracy against the recordings in full. As the interviewer, IN was able to verify the transcription quality and correct errors. Review by a second researcher would have further strengthened transcription reliability and reduced the risk of undetected errors.</p><p>This study was limited by the screening questionnaires not assessing whether participants were already undergoing or have an interest in lifestyle interventions, such as weight loss initiatives, prior to recruitment. These individuals may have had differing motivations to other study participants. Another limitation was the small number of participants that agreed to the interviews conducted throughout the study, mainly due to the high burden of the randomised cross-over trial requiring interviews across all three study phases. As a result of this small sample, saturation may not have been achieved across all themes. It is also possible that the participants who volunteered for interviews were more motivated or reflective than the broader trial population, introducing potential bias. Accordingly, findings from this sub-study may not fully represent the wider experiences of all trial participants. However, consistent findings across the 28 interviews suggest that a study using the same protocol with a larger sample would be valuable. Future research could explore potential gender-based differences in response to GS administration and motivation to eat SSF. In the present study, two of the seven participants were male and five were female, which, combined with the small sample size, prevented meaningful gender-based analysis and limited the scope of the conclusions.</p><p>The extent to which participants were actually mindfully eating (and changes to this across the study) was not directly measured. Seeing as participants notably identified the effect of the GS treatments on their ability to eat mindfully, it would be important to measure mindful eating in future studies investigating effect of GS intake on motivations to eat SSFs. Finally, participant age range was wide in this study (18&#8211;60 years) which may have introduced variation in sensory perception or behavioural responses to GS treatment. Age-related differences in taste perception, as well as possible food preferences and motivations to eat SSFs, could have influenced how participants experienced the interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-nutrients-17-02718"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The main findings of this study were (1) both GS-SYS and GS-ADLIB increased motivation (more than PLAC-SYS) to avoid SSF because the GS treatments increased mindful eating and decreased pleasure from eating SSF; (2) external influences affected both motivation as well as GS intake; (3) GS-ADLIB was deemed the most successful treatment; (4) the level of control participants felt over SSF intake fluctuated across the study due to both external factors and the use of the different treatments. By promoting mindful eating patterns, using GS might be beneficial, especially when used as part of interventions for reducing SSF intake. In addition, the preference of GS over the placebo indicated that it has potential to be positively perceived and therefore be a well-adhered-to treatment. Motivations for eating SSFs were highly complex, and consumption was affected by not only external influences, but also levels of self-control. Behaviour change requires a multidisciplinary approach, and current interventions for reducing sugar intake may not target these complex motivations appropriately. This study provides novel evidence that adults with a sweet tooth may experience motivation changes related to SSF consumption when using either GS-SYS or GS-ADLIB, but in particular the GS-ADLIB treatment approach was deemed most successful.</p><p>The findings from this qualitative sub-study corroborate results from the larger randomised controlled trial, which demonstrated that GS administration reduced SSF intake in adults [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-17-02718" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Together, these findings suggest that GS may be used as part of interventions to reduce SSF intake, not only by taste alteration, but also by promoting mindfulness of hunger and satiety cues. This study provides preliminary qualitative evidence that GS can influence motivation to avoid SSF in adults who identify as having a sweet tooth. However, the small sample size and potential for selection bias (e.g., more motivated participants agreeing to interviews) limit generalisability. Further research using a larger sample with a narrower age range, which explores gender-based responses to GS, is needed to confirm these findings and assess the applicability of GS within dietary interventions targeting SSF intake.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We give thanks to all the participants who kindly gave their time to take part in our study, as well as Nu Brands Inc. for supplying the placebo and GS mints for use in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
