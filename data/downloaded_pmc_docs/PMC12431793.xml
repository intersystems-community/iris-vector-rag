Previous work demonstrated that immunization of the rabbit animal model with vaccine candidates derived from the <italic toggle="yes">T. pallidum</italic> endothelial cell adhesin Tp0751 could reduce dissemination of <italic toggle="yes">T. pallidum</italic> to lymph nodes. In those studies, a proportion of animals exhibited complete inhibition of treponemal dissemination and others exhibited partial or no inhibition of treponemal dissemination, consistent with results expected from an outbred animal model. In the current study we further characterized the Tp0751-specific antibody response in immunized animals that showed inhibition of <italic toggle="yes">T. pallidum</italic> dissemination. To do this, we generated Tp0751 tetramers to identify Tp0751-specific B cells before and after immunization. Using this approach, we found a robust expansion of Tp0751-specific B cells in the blood and spleens of immunized animals compared to unimmunized control animals. Ten antibodies from Tp0751-immunized rabbits were cloned and binding to specific structural regions of the Tp0751 protein was assessed using epitope mapping assays and structural modeling. Importantly, nine out of the ten antibodies cloned from Tp0751 tetramer-binding B cells were able to significantly inhibit <italic toggle="yes">T. pallidum</italic> attachment to human endothelial cells <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, including antibodies exhibiting weaker binding to Tp0751. Combined, our results provide a proof-of-principle that Tp0751-based subunit vaccines can stimulate strong B cell responses resulting in the production of antibodies able to inhibit <italic toggle="yes">T. pallidum</italic> attachment to endothelial cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Antibodies</kwd><kwd>Syphilis</kwd><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Tp0751</kwd><kwd>B cell</kwd><kwd>Rabbit</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">While vaccine development typically focuses upon pathogen or toxin neutralization, the inhibition of dissemination could serve as a complementary approach for diseases caused by invasive pathogens, including syphilis. Infectious syphilis is a complex chronic disease characterized by widespread dissemination of the bacterium <italic toggle="yes">Treponema pallidum</italic> during the symptomatic and asymptomatic stages. Stages of the disease include the primary stage which is typified by the infectious ulcerative chancre, followed by a secondary stage with disseminated rash, the asymptomatic latency stage, and in some individuals the late tertiary syphilis stage involving serious neurological and cardiovascular symptoms which can arise decades after initial infection [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Dissemination of <italic toggle="yes">T. pallidum</italic> occurs early during the primary stage, and the symptoms that arise in subsequent stages are believed to be due to the immune response raised to disseminated treponemes. In addition, oral and anal shedding of <italic toggle="yes">T. pallidum</italic> occurs at all stages of infection, which may indicate a key role for dissemination in syphilis transmission [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Further, neurosyphilis and congenital syphilis occur due to treponemal dissemination across the blood-brain and placental barriers, respectively.</p><p id="P5">The <italic toggle="yes">T. pallidum</italic> vascular adhesin Tp0751 is a leading target for a dissemination-inhibiting vaccine since this protein plays a role in treponemal dissemination by mediating bacterial attachment to the vasculature [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Previously, we found that immunization of rabbits with Tp0751-based vaccines provided a spectrum of protection against dissemination, with some immunized rabbits exhibiting no treponemal dissemination to lymph nodes while others exhibited reduced <italic toggle="yes">T. pallidum</italic> dissemination to lymph nodes [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While these results are promising, further refinements are required to develop a vaccine candidate that can consistently inhibit <italic toggle="yes">T. pallidum</italic> dissemination in pre-clinical protection trials. Here, we begin to probe the mechanism of <italic toggle="yes">T. pallidum</italic> dissemination inhibition through the identification and characterization of antibodies induced by immunization of rabbits with a Tp0751-based vaccine formulation.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><label>2.</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1.</label><title>Animals and single cell suspensions</title><p id="P6">Six- to 14-week-old C57BL/6 male and female mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and maintained in a specific pathogen-free facility in accordance with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval and National Institutes of Health guidelines.

Future work is aimed at further characterizing the exact binding and potency of these antibodies and the identification of additional attachment-inhibiting antibodies so that the targeted epitopes can be finely mapped. This study has, however, facilitated the development of tools supporting <italic toggle="yes">T. pallidum</italic>-specific rabbit monoclonal antibody discovery, a significant knowledge gap in the <italic toggle="yes">T. pallidum</italic> field that can now be addressed. This study has also demonstrated the feasibility of protective monoclonal antibody identification in the pipeline of syphilis vaccine development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>supplementary material</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="NIHMS2107194-supplement-supplementary_material.xlsx" id="d67e910" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><p id="P41">Supplementary data to this article can be found online at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="10.1016/j.vaccine.2025.126804" ext-link-type="doi">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2025.126804</ext-link>.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P35">We thank T.
