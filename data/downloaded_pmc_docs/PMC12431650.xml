In the Maridi County, CDTI was re-introduced in 2017 and various interventions implemented to improve coverage.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Through successive community-based surveys, we investigated whether an onchocerciasis awareness campaign and a switch from annual to bi-annual distribution of ivermectin in Maridi County increased CDTI coverage. We also reviewed the evolution of ivermectin distribution in Maridi since 2017 and identified the determinants for ivermectin uptake.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>For past years in Maridi, CDTI programme performance has been highly variable due to security concerns, limited funding, misconceptions about ivermectin, and poor organisation of mass treatment campaigns. Community-based surveys conducted between 2018 and 2024 in Maridi found that upon switching from annual CDTI (2017&#8211;2019) to bi-annual CDTI (2021 onward), therapeutic coverage significantly increased from 40.8% in 2017 to 70.3% in 2023. Lower age, male gender, more CDTI information sources, and awareness of a link between onchocerciasis and epilepsy were all associated with increased uptake of ivermectin.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed that with reinforced awareness raising accompanying biannual CDTI, a higher ivermectin treatment coverage is achievable. The findings present an opportunity for the health system to advance its onchocerciasis elimination scheme in remote, conflict-stricken communities in South Sudan.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The neglected tropical disease onchocerciasis (also known as river blindness) is endemic is several African countries including South Sudan. For decades, the World Health Organization has relied on Community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) as the mainstay the public health intervention against onchocerciasis in endemic communities. For CDTI to be effective, at least 80% of the community must receive the drug annually for 10&#8211;15 consecutive years. Deploying and sustaining ivermectin distribution at an acceptable coverage has been challenging in the Maridi County of South Sudan, which has been subjected to insecurity and humanitarian crises for several years. Our study documents how upon re-introducing CDTI in 2017 after a period of interruption, coverage was initially low at 40%. Following a series of activities including community awareness campaigns and a switch from annual to bi-annual CDTI in Maridi, coverage rose to 70% in 2023 implying that more people were taking the drug each year. Awareness of a link between onchocerciasis and epilepsy was one of the motivating factors for ivermectin uptake in the study villages. Implementing similar approaches in other humanitarian and conflict-stricken settings could help accelerate onchocerciasis elimination from endemic communities.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>R2HC</institution></funding-source><award-id>78719</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>FWO</institution></funding-source><award-id>G0A0522N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0009-0006-0691-3697</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Colebunders</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>FWO</institution></funding-source><award-id>1296723N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Siewe Fodjo</surname><given-names>Joseph Nelson</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010434</institution-id><institution>'la Caixa' Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>B005782</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Amaral</surname><given-names>Luis-Jorge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a Research for Health in Humanitarian Crisis (R2HC) grant awarded to Amref Health Africa (project 78719).

Increasing epidemiological evidence also suggests that onchocerciasis may induce epilepsy [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Onchocerciasis elimination programmes mainly rely on community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Ivermectin is a microfilaricidal drug that kills <italic toggle="yes">O. volvulus</italic> embryonic larvae (microfilariae) and temporarily sterilises adult worms [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Using the CDTI approach, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) has been successful in controlling onchocerciasis in several African countries [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, many onchocerciasis-endemic areas in Africa &#8211; particularly those that have experienced periods of insecurity and where CDTI coverage has been sub-optimal or interrupted &#8211; are still&#160;characterized&#160;by high onchocerciasis infection and transmission, and in some places a high prevalence of onchocerciasis-associated morbidity including onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy (OAE) [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] as is the case in South Sudan [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>South Sudan is among the countries in Africa with a high burden of onchocerciasis, with about half (49%) of the country reported to be endemic for the disease [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] despite many years of ivermectin Mass Drug Administration (MDA). As early as 1995, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as HealthNet International (HNI) were implementing treatment with ivermectin [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The National Onchocerciasis Control Programme of South Sudan, established in 1996, initiated CDTI activities by 2004 [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In 2015, the national Ministry of Health (MOH) established the Onchocerciasis Control and Elimination Programme with the objective of interrupting onchocerciasis transmission in 80% of endemic areas in the country by 2020 [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. At present, this target is far from being achieved mainly due to frequent security concerns hampering the yearly implementation of CDTI, limited funding, as well as inadequate numbers and insufficient supportive supervision of community drug distributors (CDDs) [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In Maridi County, Western Equatoria, State, CDTI was introduced in the early 2000s [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, both therapeutic coverage (the proportion of people taking the drug within a community) and geographic coverage (the proportion of endemic communities reached by the programme) remained suboptimal for onchocerciasis elimination. In the programme&#8217;s early years, therapeutic coverage often fell below the WHO-recommended threshold of 65% required to eliminate onchocerciasis as a public health problem [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In 2006, around 40% (4.1 million) of the South Sudan&#8217;s population were at risk of onchocerciasis, of which 3.6 million were eligible for CDTI [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, only 26% of the eligible population received treatment with ivermectin in the five CDTI areas [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In 2016, CDTI activities were interrupted due to the transition of programme management from APOC to the MOH [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This period coincided with a shift in the WHO&#8217;s objective from eliminating onchocerciasis as a public health problem to achieving transmission elimination; the country therefore adopted a minimal therapeutic coverage goal of 80% of the entire population [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. CDTI was reintroduced in 2017.</p><p>There have been recent reports of high Ov16 seropositivity rates among children under 10 years of age in Maridi, Mundri West, and Mvolo Counties in Western Equatoria State of South Sudan [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In Maridi in 2019, Ov16 seroprevalence among children living at a site close to a dam with nearby blackfly vector breeding sites was 40.0% for those aged 3&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;6 years and 66.7% among 7&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;9-year-olds [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, the overall epilepsy prevalence in eight study sites in Maridi was 4.4%, with an epilepsy prevalence of 11.9% at the site closest to the Maridi dam which harbours the blackfly breeding site [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Based on these findings and as advocated by some NGOs working in the area (notably the Christian Blind Mission (CBM) and Amref Health Africa (Amref)), the CDTI regimen was switched from annual to biannual (every six months) in Maridi. However, in 2020, CDTI was temporarily interrupted throughout South Sudan owing to the COVID-19 pandemic but resumed in February 2021. Maridi additionally benefited from a second ivermectin distribution round in August 2021.</p><p>As a prelude to biannual CDTI resumption in 2021, Amref supported the government in an exercise to confirm existing CDDs or appoint new ones in endemic communities, ensuring the selected individuals were well respected residents of their respective villages and had received the endorsement of the village chiefs.

Meetings were organised to sensitise and mobilise health professionals, the local government, head teachers, religious leaders from churches and mosques, youth association representatives, and local NGOs. Moreover, community meetings were held to reach wider audiences in villages, particularly those with limited access to radio. Awareness messages to encourage people to take ivermectin were also delivered during football matches and during church services. The campaign activities in Maridi were monitored daily by the Amref research team and the County Chief Mobiliser, who addressed the challenges faced by CDDs. The County Chief Mobiliser visited the villages frequently to provide direct supervision and maintain communication with the mobilisation team in villages as well as using the telephone network. In this paper, we assess the therapeutic coverage of ivermectin treatment in Maridi before and after conducting the awareness campaign and implementing biannual CDTI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study setting</title><p>Field studies were conducted in Maridi County located in Western Equatoria State, South Sudan (<xref rid="pntd.0013493.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

After switching to bi-annual CDTI in Maridi, overall coverage initially increased from 40.8% in 2017 to 56.6% in 2021, and then to 70.3% in 2023 based on the results of the community surveys. Achieving this increase in CDTI coverage in Maridi, albeit modest, still stands as a remarkable feat considering that most settings experienced drastic drops in ivermectin intake in the post-COVID era [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The increase in coverage in Maridi was also reflected in OAE-vulnerable groups, i.e., children aged 5&#8211;10 years. The fact that lower ages were associated with increased odds of taking ivermectin in the multivariable model is in stark contrast with previous observations [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and could be the consequence of increased awareness about onchocerciasis and epilepsy in Maridi.</p><p>The fact that CDTI coverage increased only moderately in 2021 could be attributable to a lingering COVID-19 scare, in the aftermath of the pandemic [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; however, CDTI adherence eventually improved with the persistent campaign leading to a much higher coverage in 2023. The ivermectin coverage for the year 2021 obtained during door-to-door investigations by Amref was 56.6% (55.8&#8211;57.4) in selected villages within the Maridi Central area, while that same year, a CES conducted in a larger area of Maridi found a 46.6% (95% CI: 43.6&#8211;49.6) CDTI coverage. This difference may be a consequence of Amref&#8217;s research activities on the link between onchocerciasis and epilepsy in the Maridi Central area, which made residents of this site more likely to take ivermectin.</p><p>The difference between surveyed ivermectin coverage and the reported coverage by the government was previously observed in several onchocerciasis-endemic countries across Africa [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and can be partially explained by a reporting bias by the CDDs or County NTD officers whose hierarchy would certainly be pleased with higher CDTI coverage numbers. Unregistered demographic changes (due to deaths, population movements, etc.) can also alter the denominator used for coverage calculations. In Cameroon, differences between reported and surveyed coverages were attributed, amongst other reasons, to an incomplete census leading to an underestimation of the total population or the (in)voluntary misreporting of persons treated by the CDDs [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, the government reported coverage does not always reflect the reality and must be interpreted with caution. The 70% coverage achieved in 2023 is still below the 80% target to achieve interruption of transmission within reasonable timelines. Given the increasing ivermectin coverage because of continuous sensitisation, it is likely that adequate CDTI coverage will be achieved and sustained in Maridi which will ensure steady progress toward onchocerciasis elimination.</p><p>The CES conducted in 2021 found a trend of higher ivermectin intake among persons with epilepsy compared to the general population (68.4% versus 61.2%), although the difference was not statistically significant. There is evidence supporting that ivermectin also can reduce the frequency of seizures in persons with epilepsy [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] which might be the motivating factor for its increased intake by seizure-prone individuals. It is unlikely that the &#8220;anti-seizure&#8221; effect of ivermectin results from the penetration of the drug into the central nervous system as it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier under normal conditions [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A more plausible explanation is that the reduction in the <italic toggle="yes">O. volvulus</italic> microfilarial load after ivermectin intake is associated with fewer seizures [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In 2023, another was CES conducted by CBM to confirm the reported CDTI coverage for the May-June 2023 distribution round in several counties. This 2023 CES found a survey CDTI coverage of 81% in Maridi, which was most likely an overestimation. Indeed, 22.7% of the participants in this CES were excluded from the denominator because they were absent during CDTI. Including these individuals would yield a more realistic CDTI coverage of 58.3% for May 2023 [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The Maridi 2023 survey of children and their parents or guardians revealed that some under-five children and pregnant women consciously took ivermectin, without any major adverse events reported. In the absence of adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, there is currently no evidence to confirm the safety of ivermectin in pregnancy or early childhood. However, in 2020 in France, ivermectin was approved for the treatment of helminthiasis during pregnancy irrespective of gestational age [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. There is thus a precedent for prescribing ivermectin during pregnancy, and this is supported by the fact that poor materno-foetal outcomes have not been reported after exposure to ivermectin during pregnancy [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Moreover, it has been hypothesised that onchocerciasis treatment during pregnancy could spare the foetus from developing &#8220;parasite tolerance&#8221; towards <italic toggle="yes">O. volvulus</italic> which could foster early and intense onchocercal infection after birth [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Routinely including under-fives during CDTI should be considered because <italic toggle="yes">O. volvulus</italic> infections already happen in this age group, positioning these children as potential parasitic reservoirs that could stall elimination efforts [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In this light, clinical trials investigating the safety of ivermectin in pregnancy and early childhood are urgently warranted.</p><p>In most onchocerciasis-endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa, there is little awareness about OAE within the community, including persons with epilepsy and healthcare workers. Indeed, a survey in two rural onchocerciasis foci in Cameroon with an epilepsy prevalence &gt;4% found that 92% of the 249 community participants had never heard about the association between onchocerciasis and epilepsy, and the majority of them believed that the high prevalence of epilepsy in their village was due to witchcraft [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Hence, educating the village residents about the onchocerciasis-epilepsy link could go a long way to reduce epilepsy-related stigma [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. At the policy level, OAE awareness can also motivate stakeholders to strengthen onchocerciasis elimination measures to reap the benefits of epilepsy prevention [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In Maridi, the switch from annual to bi-annual ivermectin distribution with improved therapeutic coverage resulted in &gt;80% decrease in the incidence of OAE including nodding syndrome [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], much higher than the 50% decrease predicted during the protocol phase [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similar drops in OAE incidence were also observed in other onchocerciasis-endemic settings like in the Mvolo County of South Sudan after introducing annual CDTI [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and in the Mahenge area of Tanzania after switching to bi-annual CDTI [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The knowledge that OAE is preventable by proper ivermectin intake is still poorly disseminated in the study communities and among CDDs; whereas this information could be used as a motivating factor to increase ivermectin uptake. The generally accepted health belief model posits that the perceived severity of a health condition determines the perceived threat posed by that condition, which in turn plays an essential role in motivating health behaviour change [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In view of the broad clinical spectrum of onchocerciasis which goes beyond the commonly known skin and ocular symptoms to include neurological manifestations [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and considering that South Sudan is an important OAE focus [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], increasing the communities&#8217; knowledge base about onchocerciasis-related morbidity may indeed improve their health-seeking behaviour and motivate them to become significantly more compliant during CDTI campaigns. Our study showed that by the year 2023, nearly all caretakers of children (91.8%) in Maridi were aware that ivermectin could protect their children against epilepsy and 98.4% said they were willing to collect ivermectin themselves at a distribution point once it was available. Therefore, emphasis should be laid on improving health system performance and implementing optimal distribution approaches that would provide ivermectin to all eligible persons.</p><p>When comparing the operational implementation of the two CDTI rounds of 2023 in Maridi, one notable observation is the increased frequency of CDDs not reaching the homes of surveyed individuals to distribute ivermectin, from 11.9% (May 2023) to 17.0% (November 2023). A high rate (16.1%) of non-visits to households by CDDs was also observed in Cameroon [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This could be related to the long distances CDDs have to cover to visit each home [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and could also infer disgruntlement among CDDs who may feel over-burdened, under-motivated, and devoid of supervisory support. Besides the failure of CDDs to deliver ivermectin to some households, other reasons included the absence of household residents when the CDD did visit, and avoidance of the drug for fear of side effects. Indeed, a Cochrane review of 29 studies found that the fear of adverse events is frequently cited by communities when it comes to ivermectin intake [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Adverse events are even more feared in settings that are co-endemic with loiasis (as in some parts of South Sudan [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]), because fatal outcomes have occurred following ivermectin treatment in persons heavily infected with <italic toggle="yes">Loa loa</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the setting where CDTI is being implemented and motivate the CDDs accordingly. Another important aspect is the provision of evidence-based information to the population to mitigate their fears of taking ivermectin.</p><p>With over two-thirds of the South Sudanese population practising pastoralism [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and many others involved in subsistence farming in different locations depending on the season, many individuals are often missed in their homes during CDTI owing to their outdoor activities. A qualitative study has suggested that CDTI uptake among pastoralist communities in South Sudan could be improved by adjusting the timing of treatment campaigns to take into account pastoralists&#8217; seasonal migration patterns, by involving pastoralist leaders in CDTI planning and mobilisation activities, by ensuring that (more) CDDs are recruited from within the target communities, and by addressing negative perceptions about ivermectin [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Most of these suggested solutions can also be considered for non-pastoralist communities, in addition to another strategy which would entail an extra round of school-based ivermectin distribution among children aged 5&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;15 years who are most at risk for OAE, six months after annual CDTI [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Furthermore, considerations should be made towards storing ivermectin that is not distributed during CDTI at health centres where it can be collected by those who missed the house-to-house distribution or who become eligible shortly after CDTI such as pregnant women after giving birth. For instance, the distribution of leftover ivermectin at the child vaccination center of the Maridi County Hospital to postpartum women recovered 5.3% of missed CDTI targets in 2024 [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. To further increase ivermectin coverage, healthcare workers at health facilities also could routinely ask whether patients and their household members received ivermectin during the last campaign and offer the drug to those who missed CDTI [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, these strategies will only be successful and sustainable if people are convinced about the benefits of taking ivermectin. In the meantime, to complement the CDTI campaigns, alternative activities to reduce onchocerciasis transmission such as the &#8220;Slash and Clear&#8221; vector control method which has been embraced by the Maridi community should be encouraged and scaled-up in other parts of the country [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>We acknowledge some limitations of our study such as the verbal self-reporting approach for estimating ivermectin intake with no means of verifying the veracity of the data, and the potential risk for recall bias. There were also slight differences in survey methodologies, notably the exhaustive door-to-door approach of the Amref research team versus the independent CES conducted in November 2021. Nevertheless, our findings still provide important insights into the reporting, evolution and challenges of onchocerciasis control using CDTI in Maridi where parasitological, serological, and entomological studies all attest to high ongoing onchocerciasis transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. We also shed more light on the reasons for low ivermectin intake and put forth some interventions that can effectively drive CDTI coverage upward in resource-constrained settings like South Sudan. Such data are crucial for stakeholders to make informed decisions and plan for future actions. The steady rise in CDTI therapeutic coverage during recent years is encouraging and depicts the possibility of successfully implementing onchocerciasis elimination measures even in challenging settings like South Sudan [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the onchocerciasis situation in South Sudan is far from achieving interruption of transmission by 2030 as outlined in the WHO roadmap [<xref rid="pntd.0013493.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Stronger leadership, increased funding, supportive supervision, implementation research and strategic interventions must be deployed to sustainably accelerate elimination prospects and decrease the disease burden caused by onchocerciasis in South Sudan. Our study showed that onchocerciasis awareness campaigns and bi-annual distribution of ivermectin can considerably increase CDTI coverage. It also points to possible ways to further optimise CDTI and sustainably achieve satisfactory coverage in Maridi</p></sec><sec id="sec013" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pntd.0013493.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Reasons for not taking ivermectin as recorded during the Coverage Evaluation Survey of 2021.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pntd.0013493.s001.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pntd.0013493.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Study questionnaire for assessment of ivermectin coverage.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pntd.0013493.s002.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pntd.0013493.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Study data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pntd.0013493.s003.xlsx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the communities and authorities of the Maridi County in South Sudan for their participation and support during the various surveys.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0013493.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Letourneau</surname><given-names>ID</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Donkers</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Shirude</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Pigott</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>. <article-title>A database of geopositioned onchocerciasis prevalence data</article-title>. <source>Sci Data</source>. <year>2019</year>;<volume>6</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>67</fpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/s41597-019-0079-5</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">31118416</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC6531454</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pntd.0013493.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>World Health Organization</collab>. <source>Guidelines for stopping mass drug administration and verifying elimination of human onchocerciasis: criteria and procedures</source>. <publisher-name>World Health Organization</publisher-name>; <year>2016</year>.

All PLOS journals now require all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript to be freely available to other researchers, either</p><p>- In a public repository</p><p>- Within the manuscript itself</p><p>- Uploaded as supplementary information.</p><p>This policy applies to all data except where public deposition would breach compliance with the protocol approved by your research ethics board. If your data cannot be made publicly available for ethical or legal reasons (e.g., public availability would compromise patient privacy), please explain your reasons by return email and your exemption request will be escalated to the editor for approval. Your exemption request will be handled independently and will not hold up the peer review process, but will need to be resolved should your manuscript be accepted for publication. One of the Editorial team will then be in touch if there are any issues.</p><p>5) Please ensure that the funders and grant numbers match between the Financial Disclosure field and the Funding Information tab in your submission form. Note that the funders must be provided in the same order in both places as well. State the initials, alongside each funding source, of each author to receive each grant.

<bold>Summary and General Comments</bold>
</p><p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Overall a well written and important paper on factor influencing the increase in MDA for onchocerciasis in South Sudan. It covers many important topics. More on the conflict/insecure environment and how it may have impacted any of the activities would be useful to include as this is a neglected area of NTD research and the more information that is gathered and published, the more that practical strategies may be developed from lessons learned. I don't envisage this addition to be extensive but needs more present to appreciate the context.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Fodjo et al. evaluated the impact of onchocerciasis awareness programs combined with biannual ivermectin treatment (CDTI) in the Maridi region of South Sudan. The study demonstrated that integrating reinforced community awareness with biannual CDTI significantly increased ivermectin treatment coverage. This combined approach proved more effective than standard strategies and presents a promising avenue for advancing onchocerciasis elimination efforts in remote and conflict-affected areas of South Sudan.</p><p>Major Concerns:</p><p>1) Several studies, including some from the same research group, have already reported on the outcomes of awareness programs and biannual CDTI in other countries. However, these publications are not cited, and no comparison is made between findings across different settings. A broader contextualization would strengthen the manuscript and highlight the relevance of the results beyond South Sudan.</p><p>2) The same research group previously published a study protocol for biannual CDTI in the same region, but this earlier work is neither cited nor discussed. The manuscript should clarify the relationship between the current study and the published protocol.</p><p>3) Figure 3 is blurry and difficult to interpret. A higher-resolution version should be provided to ensure clarity and readability.</p><p>4) The full questionnaires used in the study should be included in the supplementary materials to allow for transparency and reproducibility.</p><p>5) The authors note that compliance with ivermectin treatment is higher among individuals affected by nodding syndrome (NS) or epilepsy. It would be important to also address other clinical manifestations of onchocerciasis, such as blindness or hyperreactive onchodermatitis. How many individuals in the study area suffer from these or other onchocerciasis-related symptoms? Is treatment compliance similarly higher among these individuals?</p><p>**********</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ext-link-type="uri">what does this mean?</ext-link> ).
