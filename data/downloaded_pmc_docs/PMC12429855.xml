Min pigs are an excellent local pig breed in China, but the breed&#8217;s strong disease resistance mechanism has not been clearly investigated. In this study, Min pigs and Landrace pigs were challenged with SVV, and the differences in pathogenicity between SVV-infected Min and Landrace pigs were evaluated in terms of production performance, survival rate, immune cell activity, pathological changes, viral titer, and cytokine expression. The results show that the mortality rate in Min pigs was significantly lower than that in Landrace pigs without substantial weight loss. The copy number of SVV RNA in the intestinal mucosa of Min pigs was lower than that in Landrace pigs. Additionally, the IgA and IgG titers in Min pigs were higher than those in Landrace pigs. Both the absolute number and percentage of M1 macrophages were elevated in Min pigs relative to Landrace pigs. This study is the first to identify differences in macrophage activity between SVV-infected Min pigs and Landrace pigs. The presented results indicate the potential research value of studying innate immunity differences in disease resistance between pig breeds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Min pig</kwd><kwd>seneca valley virus (SVV)</kwd><kwd>disease resistance</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>pig breeds</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>the Heilongjiang province agricultural science and technology innovation leapfrog project</funding-source><award-id>CX22JQ03</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source> Heilongjiang Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars</funding-source><award-id>JQ2024C004</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National System of Modern Agricultural Industry Technology</funding-source><award-id>CARS-35</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>31902169</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Heilongjiang province agricultural science and technology innovation leapfrog project (Grant number:CX22JQ03), Heilongjiang Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (number: JQ2024C004), National System of Modern Agricultural Industry Technology (Grant number: CARS-35), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number: 31902169).</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijms-26-08746"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In China, there are more pig breeds than in any other country in the world. There are 118 indigenous pig breeds in China according to the Domestic Animal Diversity in the Animal Genetic Resources in China [<xref rid="B1-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Most pig breeds have famous genetic characteristics, such as high meat quality and strong resistance to crude feed, general diseases, and cold. Min pigs are one of the indigenous pig breeds in the northeast of China, which is known to have outstanding disease resistance. However, different disease models have various host sensitivities in different pig breeds, as different genotypes of same the virus can generate different symptoms and phenotypes in the same pig breed. Dingyuan pigs have been shown to be the most susceptible to PRRSV (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus) infection, whereas Jiangquhai pigs are the least susceptible to PRRSV infection [<xref rid="B2-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The local pig breeds (Tongcheng, Meishan, and Qingping) exhibited stronger resistance to PRRSV compared to imported breeds (Landrace, Yorkshire, and Duroc) [<xref rid="B3-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, Dalian-type pigs demonstrated higher resistance not only to PRRSV but also to Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) [<xref rid="B4-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Two telomere-to-telomere pig genome assemblies and a pan-genome were analyzed in the Min pig and Rongchang pig, which provides insights into core genes involved in essential processes such as transcriptional regulation and immune responses [<xref rid="B3-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The composition of the gut microbiota in adult Min pigs also exhibits better anti-inflammatory effects compared to that in Yorkshire pigs in a DSS-induced colitis model [<xref rid="B4-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Pig breeds may offer advantages in terms of disease susceptibility loci, and such breed-specific variations suggest opportunities for breeding disease-resistant or disease-tolerant animals.</p><p>Seneca Valley Virus (SVV), or Seneca virus A(SVA), is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Seneca virus within the family Picornaviridae and has been increasingly reported in swine breeding farms. It can lead to neonatal mortality due to swine idiopathic vesicular disease outbreaks, which can be accompanied by lethargy, diarrhea, and neurologic signs in neonates [<xref rid="B5-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Experimental SVV inoculation has caused vesicular disease in pigs, particularly from the weaning to finishing stages [<xref rid="B7-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Most importantly, the clinical positive results in older pigs and high mortality rates in piglets last for approximately 2 to 3 weeks as the virus passes through the affected herd. Previous study found that Min pigs have better disease resistance against Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection compared to Landrace pigs [<xref rid="B8-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Both PEDV and SVV share similar pathogenic characteristics, as they both cause diarrhea and high mortality rates in neonatal piglets. However, the transmission routes and mechanisms of SVV susceptibility have not yet been elucidated. Moreover, to date, no research has been conducted on the correlation between the native pig breeds of China and their susceptibility or resistance to SVV.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the differences between Min and Landrace breed piglets in terms of pathogenicity and the immunoregulatory responses to SVV infection. This study focused on Min piglets having stronger resistance against SVV infection than Landrace piglets in terms of pathological injury, viral replication, and immune cell activity. The aim was to evaluate pathogenicity in Min piglets and to discover why their viral replication level was lower than that in Landrace piglets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-26-08746"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-26-08746"><title>2.1. Production Performance and Survival Rate</title><p>Once suckling piglets were challenged with SVV, the effects of diarrhea on their growth and development were observed in Min pigs and Landrace pigs. The growth performance results of live piglets indicated that there was a significant difference in the development of weight, which was the main difference between Min pigs and Landrace pigs in <xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A. The birth and weaning weights of Min piglets were lower than those of Landrace piglets. Certainly, SVV-infected Min piglets (SVV-Min) and Landrace piglets (SVV-Landrace) were lighter than the control groups (CON) with the infection of SVV throughout the whole weaning period. However, the weight of Landrace piglets with the SVV infection sharply decreased compared with the control group. And the weight of the Min piglets in control group did not significantly decrease compared with Min piglets after infection SVV.</p><p>There is an ongoing search for different breeds of piglets with resistance against SVV infection that can confer this trait to the host. Thus, some piglets were intranasally challenged with a dose of SVV (refer to <xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). In the Landrace pig infecting group, the first mortality was observed on Day 3 post-infection, with approximately 50% surviving after the infection. We evaluated the disease resistance in Min pigs exhibiting sickness on similar days, of which only 10% piglets died due to infection. The surviving piglets began to drink milk and completely recovered. We chose Day 10 as the terminal point to assess the significant difference between groups. No piglet died in the control groups of Min pigs and Landrace pigs. These results suggest that breed characteristics increased host resistance against SVV infection. This prompted us to investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with breed-related disease resistance.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-26-08746"><title>2.2. SVV RNA Copies Number in Two Piglet Breeds</title><p>Mouth and fecal swabs were collected to detect the mRNA of SVV for eight days after infection.

No SVV replication was observed in the Min or Landrace piglets in the control groups, and the Ct value indicated that there was no SVV infection in these two groups. The number of mRNA copies in the feces indicated that SVV significantly replicated in the Landrace piglets, at a level higher than that in Min piglets. The highest numbers of mRNA copies were observed on the fifth day after SVV infection in mouth, and that in Min piglets was lower than in Landrace piglets. The fecal swab results also showed the same trends in terms of the mRNA copies, and the fifth and sixth days also exhibited the highest copy numbers of SVV mRNA in the infected Landrace piglet group. However, Min piglets did not show significant replication following SVV infection, which indicates that the SVV mainly replicated in the intestinal tract of the Landrace piglets.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-26-08746"><title>2.3. Intestinal Mucosal-Specific IgA and IgG</title><p>The disease resistance in different piglet breeds was evaluated. The production of specific IgA and IgG in Min piglets against SVV was better than that of Landrace piglets, reflecting the specific immune response. We detected a difference in the antibody titers of SVV in different intestinal segments from Min piglets and Landrace piglets. After the challenge with SVV, the IgA titers (<xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A) in intestinal mucosa and IgG (<xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B) in Min and Landrace pigs were significantly higher than those in the control groups. This indicates that SVV could stimulate the specific immune response in both piglet breeds. Moreover, the IgA titer in the intestinal mucosa of Min piglets was much higher than that of infected Landrace piglets. Moreover, the IgA titer of the jejunum mucosa from Min pigs infected with SVV was up to 200 doubling dilutions in the small intestine, meaning that it could effectively neutralize the SVV infection. In addition, the IgA titer of the intestinal mucosa of Landrace pigs infected with SVV was about 50 doubling dilutions in the duodenum. After the challenge with SVV, the anti-SVV IgG titer was similar to the IgA titer. The anti-SVV IgG titer in Min pigs infected with SVV was much higher than that in Landrace pigs. These results indicate that the disease-resistance to SVV of Min pigs is higher than that of Landrace pigs, in terms of the specific immune response.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijms-26-08746"><title>2.4. Min Pigs Inhibit SVV Infection with Immunofluorescence Analysis</title><p>We verified the distribution of viral antigens in the intestine with fluorescence and divided them into four groups for study: negative control groups for Min piglets and Landrace piglets and infected groups for both Min piglets and Landrace piglets (<xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Most importantly, Landrace piglets infected with SVV exhibited more severe pathological damage to the intestinal tissue compared with Min piglets infected with SVV. Specifically, Landrace piglets infected with SVV showed extensive detachment and necrosis of intestinal epithelial cells, whereas Min piglets infected with SVV displayed relatively intact intestinal tissue morphology. No green fluorescence was observed in either of the negative control groups. The results for the infected groups indicated that both Min and Landrace piglets were infected with SVV. However, under observation with a fluorescence microscope, the fluorescence quantity in the Min piglet group decreased, when compared with that in the Landrace piglet group. This shows that Min pigs, with the innate breeding characteristic of disease resistance, inhibited SVV RNA replication and production in the intestine. The following figure shows representative sections derived from each group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-ijms-26-08746"><title>2.5. Activated Macrophage Inhibiting SVV in Min Pigs</title><p>In order to validate the existing phagocyte cells, microscopic analysis was performed to assess the characteristics of macrophages and dendritic cell activity from porcine intestinal tissue sections from Min and Landrace piglets, which were marked with F4/80 and CD11b, respectively. After diarrhea was observed in the infected piglets, three piglets from each group were randomly selected for necropsy. Both phagocyte cells for macrophages and dendritic cells were analyzed in Min and Landrace piglets. The control groups of these two breeds of pigs showed no significant differences in the dendritic cells (<xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B,D). Additionally, there were no noticeable intestine lesions observed among the two groups. However, the number of macrophages in Min piglets was higher than in Landrace piglets, which indicates that the former has stronger innate immunity (<xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A,C). Through immunofluorescence analysis (IFA), the SVV antigen was found to be enhanced in the cytoplasm of villous enterocytes in both infected groups.

M1 Polarization from Min Pigs Against SVV Infection</title><p>To further characterize the porcine macrophages and their M1/M2 polarization, splenic lymphocytes from Min and Landrace piglets were studied with flow cytometry in (<xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A,B). We first tested whether there was a difference in the macrophage subtypes between Min and Landrace piglets, which could affect SVV infectivity. The M1 and M2 macrophages results from both piglet groups indicated that Min pigs had the M1 breeding characteristic, which plays a significant role in defense against pathogenic microorganism infection (<xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). Most importantly, the balance of M1 and M2 macrophages in Min piglets differed from that in Landrace piglets. Moreover, M1/M2 macrophages were unbalanced in uninfected Min piglets, and the level of M1 macrophages in the Min piglets was higher than in the other breeds. There was significant difference between Min piglets and Landrace piglets in the M1 macrophage polarization (<xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). Notably, the infected groups showed similar results, M1 macrophage production in Min piglets was stimulated by the SVV infection, and the number and percentage of splenic lymphocytes were also higher than in the Landrace piglets.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-ijms-26-08746"><title>2.7. Induction of M1 Polarization Associated with SVV Is Mediated Through the Activation of IFN-&#955; and IL-6</title><p>To identify how M1 polarization is induced in Min pigs compared to that in Landrace pigs with and without SVV infection, the relative protein concentrations of signaling molecules in spleen tissues were studied via Western blot. Firstly, we sought to investigate the mechanisms by which M1 polarization was induced, which was stronger in Min than in Landrace piglets. From the results, we found that the expression levels of IFN-&#955; (<xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C) and IL-6 (<xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>E) in the Min group were higher than in the Landrace group (<xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C). Both of these are M1 macrophage markers that are linked to inflammatory processes. However, the type I IFN of IFN-&#945; (<xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A) and TGF-&#946; (<xref rid="ijms-26-08746-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D) did not show high expression in these two breeds. Both IFN-&#955; and IL-6 can stimulate M1 differentiation. The Min piglets exhibited the breed characteristic of M1 macrophage activity in the immune system. Stronger M1 macrophage activity also plays an important role against SVV infection in both pig breeds. However, Min piglets presented stronger phagocyte activity due to the M1 macrophages.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-ijms-26-08746"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>At the clinical level, the observation of vesicular lesions could affect the breastfeeding and feeding of pigs with SVV infection. Our investigations indicated that production performance and weight decreased in SVV-infected Landrace piglets. Most importantly, neonatal pre-weaning mortality was higher in Landrace piglets compared to SVV-infected Min piglets in this study, which exhibited similar pathological damage characterized by vesicular lesions and mild-to-moderate neonatal diarrhea associated with decreased weight [<xref rid="B9-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, none of these results explained why the pigs tested positive for SVV via PCR, as no gross anatomic or histologic lesions were observed in neonatal pigs [<xref rid="B10-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A previous study reported information regarding how experimental SVV infection affects gestating sows and neonates, indicating that SVV is a causative virus for the abovementioned clinical signs in neonates [<xref rid="B11-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The neonatal mortality rate of SVV infection in this study was similar to that in a previous study in 4- to 7-day-old piglets [<xref rid="B9-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In the intestines of Min piglets, mRNA of SVV was not detected in either of the infected or control groups, and the copy numbers of SVV RNA from Min piglets was lower than that in Landrace piglets regarding the mouth swabs. VP1 has been reported to elicit an antibody-neutralizing response, which allows us to distinguish it from other specific immunity mechanisms [<xref rid="B12-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The recombinant expression of SVV-VP1 protein was used to test the specific IgG and IgA in sera and different intestinal segments with the ELISA method. Positive serum samples from piglets not only demonstrated active immune response but also presented detectable SVA-VP1 IgG maternal antibodies during the first month. However, intestinal segment samples did not contain the specific IgA related to maternal antibodies, but the IgA index demonstrated an active immune response from the mucosal immune system. Our results revealed that Min piglets have stronger mucosal immunity than Landrace piglets, which may explain why the former have breed characteristics that enable them to resist SVV infection via mucosal immunity. However, none of these data indicate the clear mechanism of disease resistance in Min pigs. There is no available information regarding the immune response relating to disease resistance in Min pigs throughout the duration of SVV infection under either natural or experimental conditions.</p><p>Antiviral innate immunity primarily depends on phagocytes, such as DCs and macrophages, which play important roles in defending against viral infection in the host. However, we did not establish such a relationship or observe differences in their innate immunity against SVV infection. Studies on viral and bacterial infections have shown that variations in disease susceptibility or pathology within breeds are correlated with differences in macrophage activation [<xref rid="B14-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This approach provides a convenient basis for the analysis of genetic variations in pigs&#8217; pathogenetic interactions through the use of in vitro challenge models. Here, the results of immunofluorescence and flow cytometry observed that the macrophages from Min piglets had stronger differentiation and development abilities than those from Landrace piglets, and M1 was the key role in Min pig stronger macrophage activity than Landrace pig, which is a phenotype likely influenced by breed-specific genetic background. A previous study found substantial interindividual variation between pigs within breeds, mostly affecting the expression of genes involved in immune responses [<xref rid="B17-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Landrace pigs expressed substantially lower IL-8R&#946; levels than other breeds, such as Hampshire, Pietrain, and Duroc, and Landrace macrophages were more resistant to PRRS virus replication and released large amounts of inflammatory factors [<xref rid="B19-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>There was much greater variation between individuals within breeds, exhibited through differences based on the relative differentiation and development of macrophages. We examined the differences in the expression of cellular markers regarding macrophages between the non-infectious and infectious groups of the two breeds. Amongst the differences, higher expression levels of IFN-&#955; and IL-6 were apparent, both of which can stimulate macrophage differentiation [<xref rid="B21-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, TGF-&#946; in the Min piglet control group had a lower expression level than in the Landrace piglet control group; notably, TGF-&#946; can inhibit macrophages from undergoing M1 to M2 development. Differences between cytokines have been found in previous studies: stimulation with TGF-&#946;, induced the up-regulation of M2 macrophages [<xref rid="B23-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which explains the M1 polarization observed in Min pigs. Conversely, while TGF-&#946; is important in terminating proinflammatory and antiviral immune responses, the M1 immune response plays a role at the beginning of SVV infection [<xref rid="B24-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A previous study supported that TGF-&#946; plays a key role in DENV-2 replication in macrophages, and suggested that targeting TGF-&#946; may represent an alternative therapeutic strategy to be explored in the context of dengue infection [<xref rid="B25-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-26-08746" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. All these results indicate that individual pigs vary most markedly in their expression of immune-associated inducible proteins, and there are major breed-dependent variations in IFN-&#955; and IL-6 cell signaling, thus influencing the stimulation of M1 differentiation in Min pigs. These findings, based on SVV infection, suggest that Min pigs have stronger M1 macrophage activity and higher IFN-&#955; expression for immune-associated traits can benefit their disease resistance compared with Landrace pig.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-26-08746"><title>4.
