WRKY transcription factors are critical regulators of plant drought responses; however, the role of <italic toggle="yes">WRKY22</italic> in the woody species <italic toggle="yes">Populus ussuriensis</italic> K. remains unclear. In this study, the <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> gene was cloned from <italic toggle="yes">P. ussuriensis</italic> via homologous cloning and was found to be highly expressed in leaves and responsive to abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Subcellular localization confirmed that PuWRKY22 is a nuclear protein. Using fluorescein enzyme complementation assays, PuWRKY22 was shown to bind specifically to W-box cis-elements, indicating its function as a transcriptional regulator. Under ABA and osmotic (sorbitol) stress, the seed germination rate, root growth, and biomass of tobacco and <italic toggle="yes">Populus davidiana &#215; Populus bolleana</italic> strains overexpressing <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> were significantly increased.

Introduction</title><p>As the largest terrestrial carbon sink, global forests&#8212;accounting for approximately 45% of land-based carbon reserves [<xref rid="B1-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]&#8212;are increasingly threatened by climate-induced aridification, which jeopardizes their ecological functions. Data from the Global Drought</p><p>Information System (GDIS, <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.drought.gov/international">https://www.drought.gov/international</uri> (accessed on 18 September 2024)) indicate that shifting precipitation patterns driven by El Ni&#241;o events could double agricultural water demand and reduce freshwater availability by 50% by 2050 [<xref rid="B2-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since the 1980s, prolonged drought has placed over 280 million hectares of forest in high-risk zones for mortality, as reflected by a sharp increase in the Drought Mortality Risk (DMR) index [<xref rid="B3-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This alarming trend underscores the urgent need to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying plant drought resistance and to develop genetically resilient forest tree germplasm capable of withstanding intensifying environmental stress.</p><p>Woody plants have evolved sophisticated drought-tolerance mechanisms over long-term natural selection, with abscisic acid (ABA) serving as a central regulator of stress responses [<xref rid="B5-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recent studies have established that ABA signal transduction is primarily mediated through a core signaling cascade involving the PYR/PYL/RCAR receptor family. Upon drought perception, ABA binds to these receptors, inducing conformational changes that inhibit PP2C phosphatases. This inhibition releases SnRK2 kinases from repression, enabling their activation [<xref rid="B6-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Activated SnRK2s phosphorylate downstream transcription factors&#8212;particularly members of the AREB/ABF family&#8212;thereby initiating the expression of drought-responsive genes and triggering a cascade of physiological adaptations [<xref rid="B7-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. One of the most immediate physiological outcomes of ABA signaling is the regulation of stomatal aperture. SnRK2-mediated phosphorylation activates key ion channels on guard cell membranes, including the anion channel SLAC1 [<xref rid="B8-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the outward potassium channel GORK [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], leading to membrane depolarization, efflux of K<sup>+</sup> and anions, loss of turgor pressure, and ultimately, stomatal closure. This minimizes transpirational water loss under drought conditions. Simultaneously, ABA promotes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the activation of the NADPH oxidase RBOHF, which acts as a secondary messenger to further enhance stomatal closure [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Beyond stomatal regulation, ABA enhances oxidative stress tolerance through a dual mechanism. It directly induces the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) [<xref rid="B11-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and stimulates the ascorbate&#8211;glutathione cycle, enabling efficient scavenging of ROS accumulated under drought stress [<xref rid="B12-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, ABA signaling plays a critical role in maintaining the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) under drought conditions. On one hand, ABA-induced stomatal closure limits CO<sub>2</sub> availability [<xref rid="B13-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], increasing the risk of PSII overexcitation and photoinhibition. On the other hand, ABA enhances non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) capacity by upregulating early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) and PsbS, thereby dissipating excess light energy and protecting PSII [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, ABA facilitates the recycling of chlorophyll during leaf senescence by regulating NYC1/NOL-mediated chlorophyll degradation [<xref rid="B15-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which not only reduces photooxidative damage but also reallocates carbon and nitrogen resources to support stress adaptation. Notably, under prolonged drought conditions, ABA coordinates a PSII repair cycle [<xref rid="B16-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and NYC-dependent chlorophyll turnover [<xref rid="B17-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], forming a synergistic regulatory network that dynamically balances photoprotection and resource redistribution. Together, these multifaceted processes establish a robust, multi-layered drought defense system that enables woody plants to endure and adapt to long-term water scarcity.</p><p>The WRKY transcription factor family&#8212;one of the largest and most functionally diverse in plants&#8212;plays a central role in orchestrating ABA-mediated stress responses. WRKY proteins are defined by a highly conserved WRKYGQK motif [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and a zinc-finger domain that enable specific binding to W-box cis-elements (TTGAC(C/T)) within the promoters of target genes [<xref rid="B19-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Through this interaction, WRKYs regulate a wide array of genes involved in environmental stress responses, forming an integral component of the ABA-responsive transcriptional network. Emerging evidence highlights the involvement of WRKY factors in modulating ABA signaling at multiple levels. For instance, <italic toggle="yes">WRKY54</italic> has been shown to directly interact with the ABA receptor <italic toggle="yes">PYL8</italic>, thereby enhancing plant sensitivity to ABA and amplifying downstream responses [<xref rid="B20-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Such findings underscore the function of WRKY transcription factors as dynamic molecular switches that bridge environmental stress perception with ABA signal transduction, contributing to the fine-tuned regulation of drought resistance in plants.</p><p>In response to the urgent need for ecological restoration in China&#8217;s arid northern regions, this study focused on <italic toggle="yes">P. ussuriensis</italic>, an important native tree species, and identified for the first time the central regulatory role of the <italic toggle="yes">PtrWRKY22</italic> homolog <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> in the ABA signaling pathway. Through systematic analysis of the molecular mechanisms by which <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> regulates both the antioxidant defense system and ABA signal transduction, this research elucidates the genetic basis underlying drought-tolerant phenotypes in woody plants. The findings provide valuable genetic resources for the molecular breeding of drought-resistant tree species and offer significant practical implications for promoting vegetation recovery and constructing ecological barriers in drought-prone regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-14-02621"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-plants-14-02621"><title>2.1. Homologous Cloning and Functional Analysis of the PuWRKY22 Gene in P. ussuriensis</title><p>To identify the ABA-responsive WRKY transcription factors involved in drought stress regulation, transcriptomic data from <italic toggle="yes">Populus trichocarpa</italic> (v4.1) were analyzed following hormone treatments for 3 h. Heatmap analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that <italic toggle="yes">PtrWRKY22</italic> (Gene ID: <italic toggle="yes">Potri.002G164400</italic>) exhibited strong transcriptional upregulation in response to abscisic acid (ABA) treatment (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-02621" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Given the central role of ABA in mediating drought signaling and the established function of WRKY transcription factors in stress response pathways, <italic toggle="yes">PtrWRKY22</italic> was selected as a candidate gene for further investigation. Using a homology-based cloning strategy, the <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> gene&#8212;which is homologous to <italic toggle="yes">PtrWRKY22</italic>&#8212;was successfully isolated from <italic toggle="yes">P. ussuriensis</italic>. This cloning established the foundation for the subsequent functional validation of <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> in ABA signaling and drought resistance pathways in woody plants.</p><p>The tissue-specific expression and stress-responsive patterns of the <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> gene in <italic toggle="yes">P. ussuriensis</italic> were investigated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). As shown in <xref rid="app1-plants-14-02621" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> exhibited the highest basal expression in leaves, suggesting its potential role in regulating foliar stress responses. Under abiotic stress treatments, <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> expression displayed distinct temporal and spatial dynamics. Upon exposure to 5 &#956;M ABA, expression in stems was significantly upregulated, indicating responsiveness to ABA-mediated signaling. Under 200 mM sorbitol (osmotic stress), <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> expression showed a transient induction, peaking at 12 h post-treatment before declining, suggesting early activation in response to dehydration stress. These results demonstrate that <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> is both tissue-specific and stress-inducible, with dynamic expression profiles depending on the nature and duration of the external stimulus, supporting its involvement in adaptive stress signaling in woody plants.</p><p>Using fluorescence microscopy, the transient expression of the PuWRKY22-GFP fusion protein, driven by the 35S promoter, was observed in tobacco leaf cells. The green fluorescence signal of PuWRKY22-GFP protein was predominantly localized to the nucleus and overlapped precisely with the DAPI nuclear stain (<xref rid="plants-14-02621-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). These observations are consistent with the subcellular localization prediction generated by Plant-mPLoc, confirming that the PuWRKY22 protein is a nuclear-localized transcription factor likely functioning within the cell nucleus.</p><p>Analysis of the <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> promoter sequence using online cis-acting element prediction tools revealed the presence of multiple regulatory elements associated with abiotic stress and hormone responses. These include the abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE), the low-temperature response element (LTR), and the salicylic acid-responsive element (TCA), among others. These findings suggest that <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> may participate in diverse abiotic stress and hormone signaling pathways. Furthermore, the Pro<italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> promoter expression vector was observed to show a blue color in tissue sites such as the roots, stems, leaves, and flowers of tobacco through GUS staining (<xref rid="plants-14-02621-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), indicating that the <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> promoter effectively drives gene expression across multiple tissues. This experimental evidence confirms the promoter&#8217;s transcriptional activity and supports the bioinformatic predictions.</p><p>To determine whether the PuWRKY22 protein specifically binds the W-box cis-acting element, a recombinant plasmid, pGreenII 62-SK-<italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic>, was constructed and transformed into <italic toggle="yes">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>. Fluorescence complementation assays were performed via <italic toggle="yes">Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transient expression in tobacco leaves. As a positive control, fluorescence signals were detected at the injection site, confirming the validity of the reagents and experimental procedures. Co-infection of pGreenII 0800-W-box-Luc (containing three tandem repeats of the W-box element) with pGreenII 62-SK-<italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> resulted in a strong luciferase luminescence signal (<xref rid="plants-14-02621-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C), demonstrating that <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> binds specifically to the W-box sequence and may regulate downstream gene expression. In contrast, no luminescence signal was observed when pGreenII 0800-mW-box-Luc (containing mutated W-box elements) was co-infected with pGreenII 62-SK-<italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic>, indicating that PuWRKY22 does not interact with the mutated motif. Collectively, these results confirm that PuWRKY22 functions as a typical WRKY transcription factor with specific binding affinity for the canonical W-box motif &#8220;TTGAC(C/T)&#8221;.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-plants-14-02621"><title>2.2.

By observing the conditions of overexpressed and WT tobacco on the 0th and 15th days of natural drought treatment during the seedling stage and the 3rd day of rewatering treatment, it was found that overexpressed plants showed better growth status, photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm value) (<xref rid="plants-14-02621-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A,B), and chlorophyll content (<xref rid="plants-14-02621-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C,D) under the coercion of sorbitol and ABA, indicating that <italic toggle="yes">PuWRKY22</italic> can reduce the damage of photosystem II and maintain photosynthesis. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurements revealed significantly reduced accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8722;</sup>) in transgenic lines relative to the WT (<xref rid="plants-14-02621-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E,F).

The WPM medium without added stress treatment was used as the control. After 25 days, growth phenotypes, plant height, and root length were measured.

In contrast, 300 mM sorbitol treatment severely inhibited growth in both types; however, natural-type plants showed almost no root development. The root length of the overexpressed strain was restricted, but it was still significantly longer than that of the natural-type (<xref rid="plants-14-02621-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B) one. Control plants grew normally. Further physiological assessments revealed that overexpressed plants exhibited higher plant height, root length, chlorophyll content, and Fv/Fm values than natural-type controls (<xref rid="plants-14-02621-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C&#8211;F).

Response to Dehydration and Stomatal Changes in Overexpressed and Natural-Type Strains</title><p>To assess the dehydration response of OE and NT plants, three leaves of uniform size from tissue-cultured seedlings were detached and left at room temperature for 0, 10, 20, and 30 min, with photographs taken at each time point. As shown in <xref rid="plants-14-02621-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C, NT leaves exhibited pronounced curling&#8212;a hallmark of water stress&#8212;whereas OE leaves displayed significantly reduced curling, indicating enhanced tolerance to dehydration. To validate these findings, tissue-cultured <italic toggle="yes">P. davidiana &#215; P. bolleana</italic> seedlings were divided into two groups: natural-type controls subjected to no stress; lines exposed to 7.5 &#956;M ABA, or 300 mM sorbitol; and overexpressed lines under the same treatments. Each had three biological replicates. After 20 days of growth under 25 &#176;C light conditions, phenotypic and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging were performed. Fluorescence images under the Fv/Fm mode (<xref rid="plants-14-02621-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D,E) showed significantly lower signal intensity in natural-type leaves compared to overexpressed leaves after stress treatments, indicating more severe photoinhibition and damage to photosystem II reaction centers in natural-type plants. These stressed plants were subsequently harvested for transcriptomic analysis and stomatal detection. Stomatal behavior was further examined via scanning electron microscopy following treatment with ABA and sorbitol. Under non-stress conditions, both natural-type and overexpressed plants had similarly open stomata with comparable apertures and uniform stomatal distribution. However, under increasing ABA and sorbitol concentrations simulating drought stress, stomatal closure intensified and stomatal density decreased in both groups (<xref rid="plants-14-02621-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F,G). Notably, overexpressed strains exhibited a greater degree of stomatal closure and a lower stomatal density relative to natural-type plants, which likely reduces transpirational water loss and contributes to improved drought adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-plants-14-02621"><title>2.5.

As a key drought response signal in plants, ABA activates specific WRKY transcription factors [<xref rid="B21-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These transcription factors regulate downstream response genes by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby enhancing plant drought tolerance through mechanisms such as controlling stomatal closure [<xref rid="B22-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], promoting root development [<xref rid="B23-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and increasing the synthesis of osmotic regulatory substances [<xref rid="B24-plants-14-02621" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
