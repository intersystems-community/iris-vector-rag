However, it remains elusive why organisms have evolved such an astonishing diversity of isoforms. Here, we show that fitness and immunity properties have driven the modern evolution of <italic toggle="yes">Dscam1</italic> isoform diversity. We assess multiple aspects of fly fitness in deletion mutants harboring exon 4, 6, or 9 clusters, respectively, reducing ectodomain isoform diversity stepwise from 18,612 to 396. All fitness-related traits generally improved as the potential number of isoforms increased; however, the magnitude of the changes varied remarkably in a variable cluster-specific manner. Correlation analysis revealed that fitness-related traits were much more sensitive to reductions in Dscam1 diversity compared to canonical neuronal self/non-self discrimination. We conclude that the role of Dscam1 isoforms in canonical neuronal self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination is mediated by a small fraction of all isoforms (&lt;1/10), whereas a separate role essential for other developmental contexts and resistances, likely in fitness and immunity, requires almost full isoform diversity. Thus, fitness and immunity properties, rather than canonical neuronal functions, are the dominant drivers during the modern diversification of the Dscam1 isoform. Our findings suggest that Dscam1 diversity is closely linked to adaptation and species diversification in arthropods.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The Drosophila Dscam1 gene generates tens of thousands of isoforms, yet only a small fraction supports neuronal functions.

The genomic organization of the first three variable exon clusters is conserved across all pancrustacean species investigated, but the exon number varies strikingly [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Fly <italic toggle="yes">Dscam1</italic> has fascinated biologists because of its potential to encode tens of thousands of distinct isoforms. Biochemical analyses show that each ectodomain preferentially exhibits isoform-specific homophilic binding: each isoform binds only to itself, but weakly or not to other isoforms both in vivo and in vitro [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Each neuron produces only 10&#8211;50 Dscam1 isoforms via probabilistic splicing, thereby providing each neuron with a unique molecular code for self-recognition in the nervous system [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Genetic studies have shown that <italic toggle="yes">Dscam1</italic> is required for the wiring of diverse types of neurons [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A canonical model suggests that Dscam1 isoforms provide the cell identity that distinguishes self from non-self neurites [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and that 5,000 Dscam1 isoforms are essential and sufficient for this self/non-self discrimination process [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In our recent study, this threshold value for Dscam1 isoforms has been further narrowed down to 2,000 by finer phenotype-diversity correlations using more mutants [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, this canonical mechanism does not seem to provide a reasonable explanation for what forces drove the further expansion of Dscam1 ectodomains beyond 2,000 isoforms during Pancrustacean evolution.</p><p>One speculation is that it may reflect differential splicing outcomes in various cells. For example, some cells may exhibit a more striking bias in alternative splicing, thereby limiting access to the full isoform diversity [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Alternatively, Dscam1 isoforms may play a role in mediating cell recognition in other nervous developmental contexts. For example, Dscam1 isoforms have been reported to be required for the collateral formation of mechanosensory axons [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], as well as an essential requirement for the formation of new dendritic branches in motoneurons [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, considerable studies have shown that Dscam1 contributes to immune defenses in a variety of insects and crustaceans under certain circumstances [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, no obvious changes in overall Dscam1 expression or variant expression patterns were observed after exposure to bacteria in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Hence, the driving force behind the evolutionary expansion of a much larger Dscam1 isoform repertoire remains elusive.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that the modern evolution of <italic toggle="yes">Dscam1</italic> isoform diversity is mainly driven by fitness properties rather than canonical neuronal self/non-self discrimination. We assessed how Dscam1 isoform diversity affects various aspects of fly fitness in deletion mutants harboring exon 4, 6, or 9 clusters, respectively, reducing ectodomain isoform diversity stepwise from 18,612 to 396. Comparative correlation analyses indicate that fitness-related traits are much more sensitive to reductions in Dscam1 diversity than canonical neuronal self/non-self discrimination. Together with our previous study [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we conclude that the role of Dscam1 isoforms in canonical neuronal self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination is mediated by a small fraction of all isoforms (&lt;1/10), whereas a separate role essential for other developmental contexts and resistances, likely in fitness and immunity, requires almost full isoform diversity. Thus, fitness properties rather than canonical neuronal function are the dominant drivers during the modern diversification of the Dscam1 isoform.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Divergence and constraints of <italic toggle="yes">Dscam1</italic> diversity during pancrustacean evolution</title><p>To generate a global framework of <italic toggle="yes">Dscam1</italic> diversity across pancrustacean species, a genome-wide analysis of <italic toggle="yes">Dscam1</italic> homologs in representative species from each of the major clades was performed.

The genomic organization of the first three exon clusters was found to be well conserved across all 178 pancrustacean Dscam1s investigated, but the exon 4, 6, or 9 clusters varied strikingly in size (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g001" ref-type="fig">Figs 1A</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003383.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, and <xref rid="pbio.3003383.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). The number varied from 7 to 30 in the variable exon 4 cluster, 12 to 102 in the variable exon 6 cluster, and 9 to 53 in the variable exon 9 cluster (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Accordingly, the number of distinct ectodomains encoded by Dscam1 varies considerably, ranging from 2,106 in <italic toggle="yes">Pediculus humanus</italic> to 74,646 in <italic toggle="yes">Penaeus indicus</italic>, and the midge species (<italic toggle="yes">Clunio marinus</italic>) has the smallest ectodomain repertoires known in dipteran Dscam1 [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Nonetheless, each species can express an extremely diverse repertoire of Dscam1 isoforms, suggesting that Dscam1 diversity is ancient and functionally important. The number of variable exon 4 is relatively constant over evolutionary time, whereas the number of variable exon 6 and 9 diverges strikingly among Insecta species. For example, all 73 members of the section Schizophora contain 12 orthologous exon 4 variants in each species. In contrast, the number of variable exons in the exon 6 and 9 clusters differed, ranging from 39 to 67 in the variable exon 6 cluster and from 29 to 47 in the variable exon 9 cluster (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g001" ref-type="fig">Figs 1B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.3003383.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Furthermore, the number of variable exon 4 in midges was comparable to that in other dipteran species. In contrast, the Antarctic midge (<italic toggle="yes">Belgica antarctica</italic>) contains only 12 variable exon 6s, only a quarter of the number found in <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g001" ref-type="fig">Figs 1B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.3003383.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>).

A total of 73 mutants were previously constructed using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in which various numbers of variable exons 4, 6, or 9 were deleted, respectively [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

We combined these data from the mutants deleting exon 4, 6, and 9, and showed a positive correlation, albeit with high variation among various mutants (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>). When isoform diversity is reduced, the ability of mutant flies to fecundate is progressively weakened.</p><p>However, there were differences in fecundity among mutants with the same degree of isoform diversity. In the <italic toggle="yes">Dscam</italic><sup>Single4.x</sup> mutants, <italic toggle="yes">Dscam</italic><sup>Single4.4</sup>, and <italic toggle="yes">Dscam</italic><sup>Single4.6</sup> did not show an obvious difference from WT in terms of fecundity, whereas the majority of <italic toggle="yes">Dscam</italic><sup>Single4.3</sup> mutant flies laid three eggs per day, compared to nine eggs per day in WT (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). A similar trend was also shown in single exon 6 or exon 9 mutants, which showed a significant difference in terms of fecundity (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>). Not only single-exon mutants but also two-exon mutants showed a significant difference in the fecundity rate (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref>). These data suggest that reducing Dscam1 diversity decreases fecundity rate in a variable exon-specific manner. In addition, it was found that in most of the mutants tested, female flies contributed more to the decline in egg laying than male flies by pairwise crossing female and male Dscam1 mutant flies with wild-type controls (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the causes of decreased egg production in Dscam1 flies, we first examined the morphology of the ovaries and testes.

Quantification of the ovary&#8217;s length and vertical projection area revealed significant reductions in both compared to wild-type flies. Additionally, ovary size positively correlated with fertility (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.3003383.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C Fig</xref>). In addition, the diameter of the testes in some mutants was smaller than in the wild-type control (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig</xref>). These findings suggest that reduced Dscam1 diversity affects the development of ovaries and testes, leading to decreased egg production. Furthermore, we performed RNA-seq on ovary and testis tissue from <italic toggle="yes"><italic toggle="yes">Dsc</italic>am</italic><sup>Single4.3</sup> mutants and wild-type controls. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed two reproduction-related terms: sexual reproduction and multicellular organism reproduction (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5C Fig</xref>). The differentially expressed genes found in testis tissue, such as Sfp23F and Sfp33A4, are seminal fluid proteins that are involved in reproductive processes [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and have been validated by RT-qPCR. Other differentially expressed genes found in these two terms were further validated by RT-qPCR (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5D Fig</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that reduced Dscam1 diversity affects ovarian and testicular development and the expression of reproduction-related genes, which may contribute to reduced egg production.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Correlation of Dscam1 diversity with fly viability and lifespan</title><p>Next, an assessment was made of the effects of reducing the number of exons 4, 6, or 9 on fly viability and growth across life-history stages. Previous studies have shown that reducing Dscam1 diversity affects fly viability in a cluster-specific manner [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

The results indicated that a reduction in Dscam1 diversity led to decreased viability (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D Fig</xref>). We then examined the effect of reduced Dscam1 diversity on fly lifespan from adulthood to death. Considering the large number of mutants, we chose to use normal lifespan instead of health span for evaluation, for simplicity. There were five groups of males or females, with 30 flies in each group. The average survival days from adulthood to death of each fly were calculated to represent the average lifespan. Through the survival curve and average lifespan calculation, almost all multiple variable exon deletion mutants had shortened lifespans compared to WT (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g003" ref-type="fig">Figs 3A</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.3003383.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>), suggesting that maintaining normal adult lifespan requires nearly complete isoform diversity. The male and female adult lifespan was greatly extended as the number of remaining variable exons 4, 6, and 9 increased (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Combining these data from mutants with the deletion of exons 4, 6, and 9, a strong positive correlation was found, albeit with high variation among various mutants (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>).

These data indicate that Dscam1 diversity plays an important role in regulating adult lifespan.

This suggests that exon 4.4, 4.6, and 4.7 play a more important role in lifespan than other exon 4s. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we analyzed which features of exon 4 isoforms were correlated with lifespan variation. However, no obvious correlation was found with isoform position, homophilic binding strength, or expression level. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis revealed that exons 4.4, 4.6, and 4.7 do not cluster within the same evolutionary branch. Interestingly, multiple sequence alignment of the 12 variable exon 4 isoforms revealed that exons 4.4, 4.6, and 4.7 shared a conserved amino acid region (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7F Fig</xref>), which may be associated with lifespan difference.

Therefore, quantifying offspring and assessing parental contributions to them are considered essential for studying changes in individual fitness as well as for understanding species-specific population dynamics and life-history evolution [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As mentioned above, Dscam1 isoform diversity is necessary not only for fly fecundity but also for the survival and lifespan of animals (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). High fecundity and survival rate are important for the propagation of fly offspring. In addition, high adult lifespan implies a longer reproductive period for egg production. As in previous studies [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], we used the number of offspring that successfully reached adulthood as a measure of fitness. To estimate the total number of eggs laid by the fly over its lifetime, we multiplied the daily egg production (Fecundity) by the number of days the fly survived (Lifespan). We then multiplied this value by the survival rate (Viability) from embryo to adult to determine the overall fitness of the fly. The overall reproductive capacity is based on an equation: R (fitness)= R1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;R2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;R3 (R1: egg production rate; R2: embryo-to-adult viability rate; R3: adult lifespan rate) (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).

The relative fitness value increased substantially as the number of remaining variable exons 4, 6, and 9 increased (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). In contrast to the sigmoidal or linear function in the other phenotypes, plotting relative fitness as a function of the number of remaining exon 4s, 6s, and 9s revealed exponential functions. Based on this correlation, relative fitness is very sensitive to small-scale reductions in exon 4s, 6s, and 9s. The relative fitness value of exon 4 mutants was less sensitive to diversity reduction compared with exon 6 or exon 9 mutants (<xref rid="pbio.3003383.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), indicating a variable cluster-specific manner.

In this scenario, overall fitness is highly sensitive to small-scale reductions in Dscam1 isoform diversity. Thus, Dscam1 isoform diversity may contribute significantly to the long-term survival of the species. These data suggest that fitness-related traits are the main drivers of the modern evolution of isoform diversity.</p><p>However, although the overall fitness rate was positively correlated with the number of available exons, mutants with the same degree of diversity exhibited considerable variation.

This extraordinary genomic architecture resulting from pancrustacean Dscam1 is reminiscent of that of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genetic loci in vertebrates.

When Dscam isoforms exceed 2,000, neuronal self/non-self discrimination is no longer the main driver for Dscam isoform expansion. Instead, our data suggest that productivity-related traits may be the main drivers for the evolution of the isoform diversity. The bursting expansion in ectodomains of the housefly Dscam1 may be compatible with its powerful fecundity.

Collectively, our present data, together with previous studies, strongly suggest that Dscam1 isoforms have shared and specific defense roles against various pathogens<italic toggle="yes">.</italic></p><p>It remains unclear how Dscam1 isoforms differentially affect immune function against different pathogens. Several possible mechanisms were considered. The first mechanism possibly involves ligand&#8211;receptor heterophilic interactions. Analogous to antigen-specific receptors in the adaptive immune system of higher vertebrates, the Dscam receptors are proposed to act as &#8216;self&#8217; molecules that interact with &#8216;non-self&#8217; molecules (such as pathogens) in the invertebrate immune system. In the nervous system, Dscam receptors may recognize distinct ligands, such as netrin-1 [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and Slit-N [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Protein-interaction studies have shown that the ectodomain of Dscam binds to a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 10 (ADAM10), which is involved in the immune defense against bacterial infection [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This possibility is also supported by our observation that Dscam1 isoforms act in a variable exon-specific manner. As the reduction in Dscam1 diversity disproportionately leads to defects, Dscam1 isoforms may mediate immune defense against pathogens through ligand&#8211;receptor Dscam signaling. It is interesting to assess the reduced antifungal immunity in Dscam1 mutants through detecting the expression of downstream antifungal peptide genes, such as <italic toggle="yes">Drosomycin</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Second, it possibly involves Dscam-mediated hematopoiesis in innate immunity and phagocytosis of pathogens. Dscam1 regulates fly hematopoiesis in a cell-autonomous manner [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Third, our studies indicate that Dscam1 isoform diversity is linked to neuronal wiring, fly fecundity, lifespan, and immune responses. It is reasonable to speculate that Dscam1-mediated neuronal defects might be detrimental enough to affect the issues of fitness-related traits and immunity in flies. Finally, since Dscam1 plays a dual role in both neuronal and immune functions, neuro-immunological feedback may be crucial in linking its roles in these systems. Recent studies have indicated that Dscam1 has non-autonomous effects on hemocyte survival in <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> through its expression in sensory neurons [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It will be interesting to explore the potential neuro-immunological feedback mechanisms involving Dscam1 in the future, which may shed light on its immune functions.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Functional link between Dscam1 expression levels and isoform diversity</title><p>This study showed that reducing the Dscam1 expression level in most <italic toggle="yes">Dscam</italic><sup>&#916;4/6/9</sup> flies remarkably decreased the fitness-related traits and survival upon pathogen infection defects caused by reduced Dscam1 diversity.

By contrast, reducing Dscam1 levels prevents excessive Dscam1 signaling, thus rescuing fitness-related traits and survival upon pathogen infection defects. Excessive signaling is detrimental to fitness-related traits, which is relieved by the weakened signaling induced by reducing Dscam1 levels and/or increasing diversity. In this sense, Dscam1 isoform diversity produced by alternative splicing buffers Dscam1 signaling to ensure normal fitness. These data suggest a functional and mechanistic link between Dscam1 levels and isoform diversity independent of isoform specificity.

This suggests that, on a larger evolutionary scale, the evolution of Dscam1 isoform diversity can contribute to lineage divergence and speciation in arthropods. From a mechanistic standpoint, the number of Dscam1 variable exons can be expanded and condensed by staggered homologous recombination [<xref rid="pbio.3003383.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Once environmental conditions change, isoform change enables organisms to adapt to changing conditions. These adaptation events harboring Dscam1 occur via different pathways. One is that Dscam1 isoforms affect reproductive capacity. Our data in this study show that reducing the Dscam1 diversity leads to reduced fly fecundity, survival rate, and shorter lifespan. It would be interesting to explore the molecular mechanism by which Dscam1 isoforms mediate fly fecundity and growth in the future. The other pathway is Dscam1 isoform-mediated immune defense. Our findings suggest that Dscam1 diversity may act as a driver for lineage divergence and speciation in arthropods.</p><p>In summary, all fitness-related traits generally improved as the potential number of isoforms increased; however, the magnitude of the changes varied remarkably in a variable cluster-specific manner. Correlation analysis revealed that fitness-related traits were much more sensitive to reductions in Dscam1 diversity compared to canonical neuronal self/non-self discrimination. These data indicate that the role of Dscam1 isoforms is essential for certain developmental contexts and resistances, likely in fitness and immunity, requires more isoform diversity. Thus, we show that fitness and immunity properties, rather than canonical neuronal functions, are the dominant drivers during the modern diversification of the Dscam1 isoform.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec015"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Materials</title><p>The <italic toggle="yes">{nos-Cas9}attP2</italic> fly was used to introduce Dscam1 mutations via the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. <italic toggle="yes">W</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">1118</italic></sup> served as the wild type control, while <italic toggle="yes">if/Cyo</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">if/Cyo.GFP</italic> acted as a balancer for the mutant screen.
