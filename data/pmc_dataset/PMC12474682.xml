Further, it is crucial for the development of pharmaceutical products to advance promising drug candidate compounds from preclinical studies to FIH clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. At the stage of initiating FIH trials, several factors, such as their effects on humans, remain unknown; hence, FIH trials must be conducted carefully and with a limited number of individuals, and clinical trials must be conducted at medical institutions with advanced equipment and competent personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. FIH trials are usually conducted on healthy adults to investigate the safety of pharmaceutical products. However, for anticancer drugs, clinical trials are conducted on patients with cancer, and the purpose of proof of concept (PoC) is often taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Several Japanese pharmaceutical companies used to conduct early-stage clinical trials such as FIH trials and PoC trials in Japan. However, from approximately the year 2000, drug lag has become a problem in Japan, and the utilization of overseas data and bridging strategies have become popular as drug development strategies, and clinical development in Japan has been following that in Europe and the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, Japanese pharmaceutical companies are now targeting the US market rather than the Japanese market, and consider launching their products in the US to be a core part of their development strategy. Thus, the companies moved their development headquarters from Japan to the US, where the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is located [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In terms of pharmaceutical regulations for development, with the progress of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), several guidelines for multiregional clinical trials have been issued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Pivotal trials such as Phase 3 trials are now being conducted as multiregional clinical trials, with Japan increasingly participating in such trials, and Japan now submits applications at the same time as Europe and the US. Furthermore, the review period has been shortened, and drug lag can be resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, although global clinical development has occurred simultaneously, FIH trials are still rarely conducted in Japan and are usually conducted in Europe and the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Since 2010, demand for Japan-originated FIH trials is growing, and momentum has been building in industry, government and academia for the necessity to establish an implementation system in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In Apr 2012, a guidance regarding FIH trials in Japan called &#8220;Guidance for ensuring safety in first-in-human studies in drug development&#8221; was issued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and the infrastructure for FIH trials at medical institutions has been developed. It is believed that FIH trials are gradually being conducted more frequently in Japan; however, there are still several unknowns regarding the actual situation of FIH trials in Japan.</p><p id="Par7">Therefore, this study focused on Japan and the US as countries where FIH trials are conducted, and aimed to clarify the characteristics and background of FIH trials of anticancer drugs conducted in these two countries. Furthermore, for understanding differences in the characteristics of FIH trials in the two countries, we aimed to examine whether there is a difference in the probability of drug approval between cases where the FIH trial of the drug is conducted in Japan and in the US.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Selection of drugs and database for research</title><p id="Par8">This study covered a 10&#160;years period from Jan 2007 to Dec 2017, focusing on a&#8201;&#177;&#8201;5&#160;years period around 2012, when the guidance on FIH trials was issued in Japan.

At that time, Japan had the capability to create pharmaceutical products through basic research; however, it was pointed out that Japan was unable to conduct clinical research trials and lacked the capacity to conduct FIH trials. This situation was said to show that a &#8220;valley of death&#8221; existed between basic and clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It was thought that industry, government, and academia each had their own issues to address in conducting FIH trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The challenges were as follows: in academia, the infrastructure for conducting FIH trials was not in place and competent personnel to conduct FIH trials were not available. There was also an opinion that in order to conduct FIH trials in Japan, academia should clearly state areas in which Japan excels and areas in which it leads the world, and conduct FIH trials in those areas. With regard to regulatory authorities, when before conducting FIH trials in Japan, more data from non-clinical studies, such as toxicity studies, are required in Japan than overseas, and that the requirements by the regulatory authorities for conducting FIH trials were unclear. There have been criticisms that even Japanese pharmaceutical companies place too much emphasis on Europe and the US, and that early-stage clinical trials in development are led by Europe and the US at foreign mega-pharmaceutical companies, making it impossible for Japanese branch offices to explain the rationale for conducting FIH trials in Japan to their European and US headquarters. Since then, many parts of these issues, challenges and comments have been addressed by industry, government and academia; however, solutions have not been attained. In academia, systems and facilities for FIH trials have been established, particularly at cancer centers, and infrastructure has been rapidly developed to a level similar to that in Europe and the US. In addition, diseases and research areas such as gastric cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer and mesothelioma, which are common diseases in Japan, have been disseminated to the world as the areas of expertise of Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. From the regulatory perspective, in addition to the FDA&#8217;s guidance on FIH trials and the guidance of the European Medicines Agency on high-risk drugs for FIH trials, Japan also issued the FGuidance for ensuring safety in first-in-human studies in drug development&#8221; in Apr 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], bringing the three regulatory bodies together. The non-clinical studies required for FIH trials were also standardized to international standards by ICH-S9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The above changes in the situation have caused pharmaceutical companies to rethink the implementation of FIH trials and early exploratory clinical trials in Japan. Especially in fields such as oncology, it is now commonplace for global FIH trials to be conducted under the three regulatory bodies. In addition, the recent depreciation of the yen has also had an impact, giving the impression that the implementation of FIH trials in Japan is on the rise. In our study, two drugs (9.1%) that underwent FIH in Japan received Fast Track designation from the FDA. Additionally, four drugs (18.2%) received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA. This suggests that drugs that undergo FIH in Japan also contribute to global development. Furthermore, previous reports have shown overlaps between special pharmaceutical measures in Japan and the US. Therefore, the implementation of FIH in Japan may impact the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to comprehensively review FIH trials in Japan, and compare them with those in the US. In the present study, a comparison of the number of FIH trials between the two countries showed that the number of FIH trials conducted in the US was 10 times higher than those in Japan. The change in the number of trials over time showed an increasing trend in both Japan and the US. However, every year, the US conducted more FIH trials than Japan. Comparing the characteristics of FIH trials in Japan and the US, many trials in Japan were conducted by the top 20 sales pharmaceutical companies, whereas many trials in the US were conducted by non-top 20 pharmaceutical companies. We inferred that major pharmaceutical companies conduct FIH trials in Japan, whereas they are conducted in the US by bio-ventures and other companies. The number of patients was significantly higher in FIH trials conducted in Japan than those in the US. Comparison of the regions where the FIH trials were conducted revealed that, most of the FIH trials conducted in Japan were also conducted in the US and Europe, whereas the percentage of FIH trials conducted in the US that were being conducted in other countries was significantly lower. We inferred that Japan is currently participating in FIH trials that are conducted as multiregional clinical trials. The present study also examined the probability of drug approval following FIH trials conducted in Japan and the US. Previous studies in Europe and the US have shown that the probability of approval for pharmaceutical products that have undergone FIH trials is as low as 8&#8211;10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Another study in the US examined the likelihood of approval for anticancer drugs that had undergone Phase I trials between 2011 and 2020, and found it to be 5.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Studies outside Europe and the US showed that out of the FIH trials conducted in China between 2012 and 2020, 5.8% investigated drugs that were ultimately approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, it can be seen that the probability of approval following FIH trials is approximately 5&#8211;10%. In the present study, the probability of approval for drugs in the FIH trials conducted in the US was 10.3%, similar to that of previous studies. However, the FIH trials conducted in Japan showed a high probability of obtaining drug approval (27.2%). Considering the results of our study, we speculated that the reason for this is that most of the FIH trials conducted in Japan are FIH trials by major pharmaceutical companies, such as top 20 sales companies, and many are conducted as multiregional clinical trials with drugs that are expected to have a certain high probability of successful approval. Further, it was suggested that FIH trials conducted in the US are often conducted by small-scale companies such as bio-ventures in the US alone, with a small number of patients. Initially, we hypothesized that the FIH trials conducted in Japan would have a low probability of approval since the infrastructure had only been established recently and it had a short history; however, we found that this was not the case. We believe that, Japan can contribute to improving the global approval probability of anticancer drugs through international cooperation, e.g., participating in multicentre clinical trials.</p><p id="Par26">The present study has several limitations. First, we used ClinicalTrial.gov as our search database for clinical trials; however, trials and pharmaceutical products not registered with it were not investigated. Second, we investigated approval status based on information from public sources such as company websites, but pharmaceutical companies may not have announced the discontinuation of new drug development, and these drugs may have been classified as under development. Third, the probability of approval may be influenced by several potential confounders outside the scope of this study (e.g., cancer type, mechanism of action, investigational site selection, and size of company etc.). Finally,, since only anticancer drugs are included in this study, FIH trials in other areas are expected to yield different results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par27">We investigated FIH trials of anticancer drugs initiated in Japan or the US between 2007 and 2017. The number of FIH trials in Japan and the US increased annually; however, we found that the backgrounds including &#8220;sponsors&#8221;, &#8220;number of patients&#8221; and &#8220;regions where FIH trials are conducted&#8221; are different between Japan and the US. In addition, the probability of approval was higher for anticancer drugs that underwent FIH trials in Japan than for those in the US. FIH trials in Japan and the US exhibited differences in characteristics. Further, the probability of approval was higher for anticancer drugs that had undergone FIH trials in Japan than those in the US. Based on these, it was inferred that the FIH trials conducted in Japan are clinical trials by major pharmaceutical companies, are conducted as multiregional clinical trials in collaboration with Europe and the US, and with drugs that are expected to have a certain high probability of successful approval.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="10147_2025_2849_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (XLSX 11 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Ulatus (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ulatus.jp/">https://www.ulatus.jp/</ext-link>) for English editing and proofreading of this manuscript.</p></ack><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>The authors did not receive support from any organization for the submitted work.</p></notes><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data available on request from the researchers after approval by the corresponding author.</p></notes><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1" notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par28">The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest<bold>.</bold></p></notes><notes id="FPar2"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="Par29">This study did not require institutional review board approval or patient informed consent because it was based on publicly available information and involved no patient records.</p></notes></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation-alternatives><element-citation id="ec-CR1" publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Sarangi</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Reeta</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>First-in-human dose: current status review for better future perspectives</article-title><source>Eur J Clin Pharmacol</source><year>2020</year><volume>76</volume><issue>9</issue><fpage>1237</fpage><lpage>1243</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s00228-020-02924-x</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32488334</pub-id></element-citation><mixed-citation id="mc-CR1" publication-type="journal">Mishra A, Sarangi SC, Reeta K (2020) First-in-human dose: current status review for better future perspectives.
