Although it has been shown to interact with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, its role during vaccination remains poorly understood. Methods: To address this question, we combined in vitro assays to characterize CLEC5A and spike expression and their impact on monocyte differentiation and T-cell activation; in vivo studies to evaluate CLEC5A expression, immune responses, and vaccine efficacy in a murine model; and in silico analyses to identify potential spike epitopes and CLEC5A interaction sites. Results: The Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent mRNA vaccine induced spike expression and CLEC5A upregulation in THP-1 monocytes, promoting M1-like differentiation and CD86<sup>+</sup> activation. In PBMC co-cultures, CLEC5A<sup>+</sup> monocytes acted as antigen-presenting cells, releasing inflammatory chemokines and activating both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, thereby linking CLEC5A expression to adaptive immunity. In mice, CLEC5A expression was observed on inflammatory monocytes (CCR2<sup>+</sup>CX3CR1<sup>low</sup>) within two days of vaccination. In vivo, CLEC5A expression increased during SARS-CoV-2 infection and after immunization, but declined following viral challenge in vaccinated animals. Consistently, robust humoral and cellular responses were detected post-immunization. In silico analysis further suggested differential CLEC5A binding across B- and T-cell epitopes within the spike glycoprotein. Conclusions: These findings suggest that CLEC5A may play a role in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Although further studies with different vaccine platforms are necessary to confirm and expand these observations, our results provide preliminary evidence supporting the potential of CLEC5A as an exploratory biomarker of vaccine-induced immunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mRNA vaccine</kwd><kwd>animal models</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>CLEC5A</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#237;fico e Tecnol&#243;gico</funding-source><award-id>408490/2022-5</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Funda&#231;&#227;o Oswaldo Cruz/Ministry of Health/PAHO</funding-source><award-id>BIO-006-FIO-21</award-id><award-id>VPGDI-PT69</award-id><award-id>BIO-003-FEX-23</award-id><award-id>BIO-002-AEP-23</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Funda&#231;&#227;o de Amparo &#224; Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro</funding-source><award-id>E-26/200.205/2023</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>Financial support was provided by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#237;fico e Tecnol&#243;gico (CNPq 408490/2022-5) and Funda&#231;&#227;o Oswaldo Cruz/Ministry of Health/PAHO (BIO-006-FIO-21, VPGDI-PT69, BIO-003-FEX-23, BIO-002-AEP-23) to Patricia Cristina da Costa Neves, while the Funda&#231;&#227;o de Amparo &#224; Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ-JCNE E-26/200.205/2023) provided financial support to Juliana Gil Melga&#231;o.

Introduction</title><p>The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, led to high morbidity and mortality rates in 2020&#8211;2021, prompting a global effort to develop treatments and vaccines [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Various vaccine platforms, including viral vectors and mRNA vaccines, were successfully developed and widely licensed by 2021 [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While these vaccines significantly reduced severe cases and deaths, emerging variants like Omicron posed challenges due to increased transmissibility and immune evasion [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>To ensure long-term immunity, it is crucial to evaluate the persistence of memory cells, cross-reactivity among variants, and the effectiveness of bivalent vaccines in preventing severe cases. Inflammation control remains a key factor in disease regulation post-vaccination, as SARS-CoV-2 affects systemic immune homeostasis and vaccine functionality [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Given that inflammation control is a crucial determinant of vaccine-induced immunity, receptors involved in pathogen recognition and inflammatory signaling, such as CLEC5A, have gained increasing attention [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>CLEC5A, also known as myeloid DAP12-associating lectin-1 (MDL-1), is a Syk-coupled pattern recognition receptor predominantly expressed on monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. It preferentially recognizes glycans that are abundantly displayed on the surface of viruses and other pathogens. Upon antigen binding, CLEC5A can form multivalent heterocomplexes with other C-type lectins, such as DC-SIGN and the mannose receptor, as well as with Toll-like receptors (TLRs).

The genes related to inflammatory profile (IL1B, TNF and CLEC5A) were upregulated in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, as expected. Meanwhile, the genes related to innate antiviral activity were downregulated (NFKB, IFNA, IFNB) (<xref rid="viruses-17-01233-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>A). The immunization with bivalent mRNA vaccine was characterized by upregulation of genes expressing proinflammatory cytokines (CCL2, and IL1B), complement activation (CFH), inflammasome (NLRP3), and genes involved with receptors of innate immunity that trigger inflammation (TLR2, TYK2, JAK1) (<xref rid="viruses-17-01233-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>B). After the viral challenge, as expected, mice presented upregulation of genes related to the innate antiviral response (STAT2 and RNASEL). Interestingly, the expression of TLR2 and NLRP3 after challenge remained upregulated (1.03-fold-change &#177; 0.40 and 0.74-fold-change &#177; 0.25 respectively), in levels not statistically different from the ones triggered by immunization (1.18-fold-change &#177; 0.37 and 1.14-fold-change &#177; 0.40) (<xref rid="viruses-17-01233-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>B). Quantification of CLEC5A gene expression in animals revealed a slight increase following immunization compared with controls, which was also observed&#8212;at a higher level&#8212;in non-immunized animals challenged with SARS-CoV-2. However, in animals immunized with two doses of the vaccine and subsequently challenged with the virus, CLEC5A expression was significantly reduced compared with both vaccinated-only and non-immunized infected animals (<xref rid="viruses-17-01233-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>A&#8211;C).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot8-viruses-17-01233"><title>3.8.

Discussion</title><p>This study highlights the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid development of effective vaccines. With the approval and commercialization of COVID- 19 vaccines, an mRNA bivalent vaccine, including the Omicron BA.4/5 variant, was introduced in Brazil in 2023 [<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Monitoring the immune response and inflammatory regulation following these vaccine formulations remains crucial. Our research emphasizes the importance of inflammation control in post-vaccination COVID-19 management by investigating C-type lectin mechanisms, particularly CLEC5A expression and inflammatory gene activation through in vitro, in vivo and in silico experiments [<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent mRNA vaccine efficiently delivered to THP-1 monocytes, with peak spike expression at 48 h, paralleling CLEC5A upregulation. This was accompanied by M1-like macrophage differentiation and robust CD86<sup>+</sup> activation, in line with Zelkoski et al., 2025 [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In co-culture with human PBMCs from vaccinated subjects [<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], THP-1 cells acted as functional APCs, driving inflammatory chemokine release and activation of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Fluorescence microscopy showed that spike protein was expressed on the surface of THP-1 cells along with CD11a, a surface marker. These findings establish a mechanistic link between CLEC5A expression and T cell activation during SARS-CoV-2 immunization, consistent with our previous observations in yellow fever vaccination [<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Our previous study with human samples revealed reduced CLEC5A expression in individuals who experienced natural SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination, compared to unvaccinated individuals with mild or severe COVID-19. Fully vaccinated individuals with a history of COVID-19 exhibited CLEC5A expression in immune cells, but at lower activation levels than those with severe disease. These findings support the role of CLEC5A in early innate immune activation, which may help mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection and enhance immune responses following full vaccination [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, this present study demonstrated that inflammatory phenotype of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (CD11c+) can express CLEC5A after in vitro incubation with the mRNA vaccine using ex vivo blood from K-18-hACE-2 mice.</p><p>In an in vivo K18-hACE2 mouse model, the bivalent mRNA vaccine conferred protection against SARS-CoV-2 Gamma infection by reducing viral loads in nasal fluids, brain, and lungs, while preserving body weight and survival of immunized and challenged animals. The Gamma variant is capable of inducing mortality in susceptible animals, such as the K18-hACE2 mouse strain, thereby enabling the acquisition of more robust data on protection against infection using SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the use of the Omicron variant in the same mouse strain did not exhibit comparable pathogenicity [<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, it would not be a suitable variant for preclinical studies aimed at evaluating cause&#8211;effect relationships of vaccination, such as protective efficacy.</p><p>SARS-CoV-2 can disrupt systemic immune homeostasis, and effective vaccine functionality must address this issue, as seen in our follow-up clinical data and by others [<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Previous studies indicated that C-type lectin receptors, such as CLEC5A on monocytes, play a significant role in the inflammatory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 proteins [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our findings confirmed the role of CLEC5A in the SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as elevated levels of the inflammatory genes <italic toggle="yes">TNFA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">IL1B</italic> after the viral challenge, alongside downregulation of antiviral genes, as seen by other groups with animal models [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Sung et al. (2022) demonstrated that CLEC5A, together with TLR2, is highly activated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to potent inflammation in mouse models; both are critical markers in disease evolution and possible targets for therapies [<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our previous study also showed that CLEC5A was detected in monocytes from severe COVID-19 patients and in hamster models challenged with Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 strains [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Here, in immunized mice, the CLEC5A and TLR2 expression were elevated after vaccination, but reduced in mice immunized and then challenged, reinforcing the concept of protection by an mRNA vaccine, also confirmed by robust specific spike-IgG, IFN-&#947; secretion, and memory B/T cell response in immunogenicity experiments [<xref rid="B27-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>In light of the above, our findings suggest that immunization could regulate CLEC5A, playing a role in inflammation control. This regulation was further supported by cytokine and inflammatory marker data from gene expression analyses. Our data can support mRNA vaccine development, serving as a model for preclinical studies to evaluate innate and adaptive immunity against several infectious diseases.</p><p>Molecular docking added information about the CLEC5A interaction with distinct regions of the spike glycoprotein compared with epitopes recognized by B- and T-cell peptides. In our previous study, it was demonstrated that spike protein subunit (S1) is able to interact with CLEC5A in a different manner, independently of ACE-2 receptor interaction with the host cells [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Here, we showed the localization of the spike protein to which CLEC5A binds. The CLEC5A residues interacting with the spike glycoprotein are not the same as the epitopes for immune cell activation. Although the range of immune response activation is large (250&#8211;800aa), the major activation site is under position 300aa for T cells and 400&#8211;500aa for neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, the other domains, such as the furin cleavage site, fusion peptide, and heptad-repeat region, are not involved in interactions with CLEC5A, as expected.</p><p>We acknowledge limitations common to animal studies, including the use of the highly inflammatory Gamma strain for viral challenge, despite the Omicron strain being a key component of the bivalent vaccine [<xref rid="B29-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our primary focus was to assess virus-induced inflammation and its control through immunization. Additionally, conducting post-challenge cell cultivation in a BSL-3 facility was limited due to the need for specialized training [<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-01233" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the in vitro assays, specifically the co-culture of PBMCs with THP-1 cells, we acknowledge the limitation of the small sample size (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5). Nevertheless, as preliminary data, these pilot studies are critical for generating initial insights and informing the design of more comprehensive investigations. Despite this limitation, the findings provide valuable information on APC-mediated peptide/protein recognition in previously vaccinated individuals.</p><p>While the activation of a robust adaptive immune response is not new to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, the role of CLEC5A in immunization remains unclear. This study enhances our understanding of immune mechanisms, particularly the involvement of C-type lectins like CLEC5A in inflammation and memory responses. These insights are essential for improving vaccine efficacy against emerging variants and guiding next-generation vaccine development. Future research should further explore CLEC5A&#8217;s role and immune memory persistence across populations. Overall, this study underscores the importance of inflammation control and immune memory in effective disease management and vaccine strategies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the BSL-3 facility staff for their support during the animal study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
