The reduction in oestrogen levels leads to a progressive decrease in trabecular bone volume, rendering the bone structure fragile and diminishing its resilience to physical stress, thereby increasing the risk of fractures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Fragility fractures constitute a major cause of disability and mortality in the elderly population. Mitigating the risk of fragility fractures hinges upon the effective management of osteoporosis. Current therapeutic approaches predominantly rely on oestrogen replacement therapy, bisphosphonates, and parathyroid hormone analogues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, these modalities present certain limitations and adverse effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, such as the perceived association of oestrogen replacement therapy with increased risks of cardiovascular events and breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Prolonged administration of zoledronic acid increases the incidence of severe atrial fibrillation among patients, whereas some patients may experience severe musculoskeletal pain within days or months of commencing bisphosphonate therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Commonly used parathyroid hormone analogues, such as teriparatide, can induce limb pain, headaches, and nausea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic agents.</p><p id="Par4">With the progression of inquiry into traditional Chinese herbal pharmacopeia and its enduring application over past eras, an increasing number of researchers are shifting their focus to the use of Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Studies have revealed that the traditional herb Radix et Rhizoma Coptidis primarily targets key pathways, such as the <italic toggle="yes">Hif-1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Pi3k&#8211;Akt</italic> pathways, along with oestrogen-related signalling pathways, in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, enhancing osteogenesis and angiogenesis by modulating targets such as <italic toggle="yes">Jun</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Tp53</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Akt1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Esr1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Mark14</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Additionally, network pharmacology predictions and experimental validation have demonstrated that the traditional herbal formula Bu Yang Huan Wu Tang (BYD) may treat postmenopausal osteoporosis by activating the &#946;-catenin signalling pathway through oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Given the complexity of the components and unclear specific molecules and targets responsible for the therapeutic effects of natural herbs, optimizing and purifying the effective substances of Chinese herbal medicines often enhance their efficacy. The pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis is significantly influenced by the activities and functions of osteoclast precursor cells, indicating that these cells are pivotal contributors to the progression of this medical condition, with RAW264.7 cells being the most common osteoclast precursor cell line used to assess bone resorption activity during the development of postmenopausal osteoporosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. We previously conducted a cell phenotype-based high-throughput screen of 2160 bioactive or clinically used compounds from an FDA-approved drug library (Selleck Chem) and found that zingerone significantly inhibits RAW264.7 cells. Zingerone is a bioactive substance derived from <italic toggle="yes">Zingiber officinale Roscoe</italic>, a plant belonging to the Zingiberaceae family that is native to regions such as China and Southeast Asia. As a commonly used and widely available plant, it can be used to prepare ethnic herbal medicines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and it has extensive clinical applications in folk medicine and has been confirmed to possess anti-inflammatory properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and antioxidant effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This study revealed that a traditional Chinese medicine prepared from dried ginger, when combined with processed aconite and roasted liquorice root as the Sini Decoction, can treat symptoms such as limb fatigue, as recorded in the &#8220;Chinese Pharmacopoeia&#8221; (2020 edition, Volume 1). Zingerone, a key component of dried ginger, has antiulcer, antioxidant, and growth-promoting properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism by which zingerone treats postmenopausal osteoporosis by acting on RAW264.7 osteoclast precursor cells remains unclear.</p><p id="Par5">Omics technologies enable the systematic and comprehensive study of the overall and dynamic characteristics of diseases, aiding in the identification of potential biomarkers and the elucidation of disease pathogenesis and drug treatment mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Compared with a single analysis, a multiomics integrative analysis provides further validation at the molecular level, effectively advancing the development of novel therapeutic strategies and providing a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the present study, bone tissue metabolomics combined with transcriptomics revealed the association of zingerone treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis with the ferroptosis pathway. Further validation indicated that zingerone increases ferroptosis sensitivity through p53, which regulates SAT1 and GPX4, thereby promoting osteoclast precursor cell ferroptosis and achieving the therapeutic purpose of treating postmenopausal osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Zingerone affects RAW264.7 cell proliferation and bone quality in OVX mice</title><p id="Par6">The addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an exogenous ROS simulates the oxidative stress environment of osteoporotic precursor cells postmenopause and activates the proliferation and differentiation of RAW264.7 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A CCK-8 assay was utilized to assess the effects of various concentrations of zingerone on the viability of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated RAW264.7 cells. At a concentration of 400&#8201;&#956;M, zingerone significantly reduced the viability of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated RAW264.7 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), leading to the selection of 400&#8201;&#956;M zingerone for further experiments. Consistent with previous studies, OVX mice were orally administered 100&#8201;mg/kg zingerone for two months. An examination of the major organs through a histological analysis with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining did not reveal any considerable organ damage or signs of inflammation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The micro-CT evaluation of the distal femurs of the mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>) revealed a significant reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) in the model group compared with the control group. However, compared with the OVX group, the treatment group presented a substantial increase in trabecular bone density. In addition, key histomorphometric indicators, such as the trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), bone volume fraction (BV/TV), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), were significantly improved following zingerone administration (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). The histopathological examination of sagittal sections from the distal femur (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>, Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2A, B</xref>) showed that the femoral tissue from the control group displayed uniform staining, well-aligned trabeculae, an intact osteoblast architecture, consistent growth plate thickness, and no signs of inflammation. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining revealed a limited number of osteoclasts surrounding the trabeculae. In contrast, the model group presented a reduced trabecular number, localized thinning, enlarged marrow cavities, and disrupted growth plates, accompanied by a marked increase in the number of osteoclasts around the trabecular structures, as observed using TRAP staining. After zingerone treatment, the number and thickness of trabeculae were significantly increased, whereas the number of osteoclasts was notably decreased. As an approach to obtain deeper insights into the mechanism underlying the effect of zingerone on bone metabolism, immunofluorescence staining was performed to assess the expression of osteocalcin (OCN), an osteoblast-specific marker, in bone tissue. The results revealed the significant upregulation of OCN expression in the zingerone-treated group compared with the model group, consistent with the findings from micro-CT and histological analyses (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>, Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2C</xref>). In addition, Western blot analysis revealed that, compared with the control group, the OVX group presented significantly decreased levels of osteogenesis-related proteins, including runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), along with increased expression of the osteoclast-associated markers matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and cathepsin K (CTSK). Zingerone treatment led to a dose-dependent restoration of osteogenic protein expression and the significant suppression of osteoclast-related protein levels (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G&#8211;J</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that zingerone significantly improves the structural integrity of femoral tissue in OVX mice, particularly by increasing the trabecular number and thickness.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Effect of zingerone on RAW264.7 cell proliferation and bone mass in OVX mice.</title><p><bold>A</bold> CCK-8 assay assessing the effect of different concentrations of zingerone on RAW264.7 cell proliferation (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;3 independent biological replicates). <bold>B</bold> H&amp;E-stained images of sections of major organs from mice (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6 per group).

Low concentrations of zingerone (0&#8211;25&#8201;&#956;M) appeared to promote the proliferation of osteoclast precursor cells. However, with increasing concentrations, the inhibitory effects became evident, with significant suppression observed at 400&#8201;&#956;M (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). Treatment with H&#8322;O&#8322; alone at a concentration of 200&#8201;&#956;M most effectively promoted cell proliferation. In contrast, higher concentrations resulted in increased cytotoxicity, and severe cellular damage was observed after treatment with 1000&#8201;&#956;M H&#8322;O&#8322; (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).

The subsequent Western blot analysis of ferroptosis-related proteins under the same treatment conditions revealed that p53 and SAT1 were substantially downregulated in the 200&#8201;&#956;M group, whereas GPX4 expression was increased. In contrast, the 1000&#8201;&#956;M group exhibited the opposite expression pattern (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E&#8211;F</xref>). The cells were divided into normal control, model, treatment, and <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> knockdown groups to further elucidate the modulation of osteoclast precursor cell ferroptosis sensitivity and the mechanism of ferroptosis induced by zingerone. Although a previous study showed that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> promotes the proliferation and differentiation of RAW264.7 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, our experiments revealed that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> inhibited ferroptosis in RAW264.7 cells. Based on the joint analysis results and the changes in the expression of the <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic>-mediated <italic toggle="yes">Sat1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Gpx4</italic> ferroptosis-related genes, <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> may be a target of zingerone in osteoclast precursor cells. RAW264.7 cells were exposed to different concentrations of RSL3, and cell viability was evaluated after 24&#8201;hours. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), which indicates the RSL3 concentration required to induce the death of 50% of cells, was used to assess ferroptosis sensitivity. IC50 curves were generated for each treatment group, and the corresponding values were calculated. The treatment group required 2.9&#8201;&#956;M RSL3 for 50% cell death, whereas the gene knockdown group required 3.5&#8201;&#956;M RSL3 for 50% cell death. In addition, <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> knockdown rescued the impaired cell viability caused by RSL3. Thus, zingerone treatment increased the sensitivity of cells to ferroptosis but reduced their sensitivity to ferroptosis after <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> knockdown (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). After zingerone treatment, the highest ROS levels were observed, which led to ferroptosis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5H, I</xref>). JC-1 staining revealed that the red/green fluorescence ratio of the cells decreased after zingerone treatment, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction, whereas the red/green fluorescence ratio of the cells with <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> knockdown was not affected by zingerone treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5J, K</xref>), indicating that the inhibitory effect of zingerone on RAW264.7 cells was mediated by p53 regulation. The intracellular MDA levels increased after zingerone treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5L</xref>), which indicated excessive oxidation of the cells and increased sensitivity to ferroptosis. Intracellular Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels were detected using an iron ion probe and confocal microscopy.

In addition, after 24&#8201;h of treatment with 400&#8201;&#956;M zingerone in differentiated cells, the expression level of GPX4 was significantly reduced, whereas the p53 and SAT1 expression levels were markedly increased in osteoclasts (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7G, H</xref>). Notably, knockdown of the <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> gene in osteoclasts attenuated the inhibitory effect of zingerone on osteoclast differentiation markers (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7I, J</xref>) and markedly reduced its proferroptotic effect (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7K, L</xref>). These findings suggest that zingerone may inhibit osteoclast differentiation by promoting ferroptosis. Western blot analysis was performed to detect changes in markers related to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis (caspase-12 and cleaved caspase-12), autophagy (Beclin-1 and LC3B), and pyroptosis (GSDMD and GSDMD-N) as a method to further determine whether zingerone affects other forms of cell death. The results showed no significant differences in the expression of these proteins between the zingerone-treated and model groups (Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

Chemical synthetic drugs for osteoporosis treatment face challenges, such as long development cycles, high costs, potential side effects, and unclear efficacy. In contrast, traditional Chinese herbal medicine is cost-effective and generally associated with lower toxicity. In a screening study of drugs approved by the FDA, our previous findings were the first to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of zingerone in managing postmenopausal osteoporosis. Osteoclast precursors undergo differentiation into mature osteoclasts in response to RANKL and M-CSF, thereby promoting bone resorption. Once osteoclasts mature, they lose their proliferative capacity, indicating that the proliferation and death of osteoclast precursor cells determine the number of osteoclasts, a major factor in the homeostasis of bone formation and resorption. Dennis J Wu et al. confirmed that in the early stages of postmenopausal osteoporosis, M-CSF promotes the proliferation and survival of RAW264.7 cells, disrupting the balance between bone formation and resorption and leading to osteoporosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, inhibiting the proliferation of osteoclast precursor cells and inducing their death can directly reduce the source of osteoclasts and decrease bone resorption, thereby treating postmenopausal osteoporosis. The present study utilized combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to elucidate the mechanism of action and potential targets of zingerone in treating postmenopausal osteoporosis. Cellular experiments confirmed that zingerone upregulates the expression of the p53 protein in osteoclast precursor cells, regulates the SAT1 and GPX4 pathways, and increases sensitivity to ferroptosis, thereby reversing bone loss in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients.</p><p id="Par19">Postmenopausal osteoporotic bone tissue is in a prolonged state of oxidative stress, leading to the excessive activation of osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts and ultimately leading to increased bone loss. Mitochondria, the primary organelles that regulate the balance between oxidation and reduction, are highly susceptible to oxidative damage. The collapse of the mitochondrial antioxidant system due to cellular oxidative damage leads to ferroptosis, which is characterized by changes in mitochondrial morphology and function, as well as the accumulation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and lipid peroxides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Oxidative damage to cells leads to mitochondrial morphological changes, such as shrinkage, reduced numbers of cristae, and an increased membrane density. The accumulation of lipid peroxides in mitochondria inhibits system Xc of glutathione (composed of the SLC7A11 catalytic subunit and the SLC3A2 accessory subunit), thereby increasing sensitivity to ferroptosis and promoting its occurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We previously reported a close association between ferroptosis and the occurrence and development of postmenopausal osteoporosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The present findings revealed the differential expression of genes in 20 pathways through the transcriptomic analysis, including ferroptosis, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and cell adhesion molecules. Among these pathways, ferroptosis-related genes accounted for a relatively high proportion of the overall correlation. The IC50 curve of RSL3 further confirmed that zingerone increases the sensitivity of osteoclast precursor cells to ferroptosis. Taken together, these findings indicate that the increased sensitivity to ferroptosis and subsequent ferroptosis of osteoclast precursor cells is a specific manifestation of the effectiveness of zingerone in treating postmenopausal osteoporosis. Zingerone induces the accumulation of lipid peroxides, increases oxidative stress, and induces ferroptosis in osteoclast precursor cells.</p><p id="Par20">During bone remodelling, oxidative stress is a critical regulatory factor maintaining the dynamic balance between bone formation and resorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Under physiological conditions, moderate levels of ROS act as signalling molecules that promote osteoclast differentiation and stimulate osteoblasts and their precursors to secrete osteogenic factors, such as BMP-2 and osteocalcin, thereby accelerating bone remodelling and supporting tissue renewal and repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, under pathological oxidative stress, such as that observed in postmenopausal oestrogen deficiency or type 2 diabetes, excess ROS accumulation disrupts the balance between bone formation and resorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In postmenopausal women, a sharp decrease in oestrogen levels leads to an impaired antioxidant capacity, reduced differentiation of bone marrow-derived MSCs into osteoblasts, and increased osteoclast activity, resulting in decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption, and accelerated bone loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In patients with type 2 diabetes, increased oxidative stress not only suppresses the expression of osteogenic genes but also promotes osteoclast differentiation, ultimately contributing to a decreased bone mineral content, impaired bone quality, and a significantly increased fracture risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, diabetic conditions have been shown to impair bone repair and delay fracture healing, further aggravating the metabolic imbalance in bone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">In this study, we found that treatment with low concentrations of H&#8322;O&#8322; promoted the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells, whereas higher concentrations significantly reduced cell viability. A similar biphasic response was observed with zingerone treatment, suggesting that zingerone may exert a dual regulatory effect on RAW264.7 cell proliferation. This hypothesis was supported by further evidence: low concentrations of zingerone (0&#8211;25&#8201;&#956;M) promoted RAW264.7 cell proliferation and differentiation, whereas high concentrations (200&#8211;400&#8201;&#956;M) markedly suppressed proliferation. Additionally, in H&#8322;O&#8322;-treated osteoclasts, the subsequent addition of zingerone (50&#8211;400&#8201;&#956;M) further increased oxidative stress and induced <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic>-mediated ferroptosis. The dual effects of zingerone on RAW264.7 cell differentiation and ferroptosis appear to be concentration dependent. A detailed investigation into the dose-dependent effects of zingerone on osteoclasts may provide deeper insights into the mechanisms governing bone remodelling under both physiological and pathological conditions.</p><p id="Par22">Oestrogen deficiency leads to abnormal conversion between oxidized and reduced glutathione, resulting in excessive ROS production and oxidative damage to bone tissue, a characteristic feature of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The KEGG enrichment analysis of metabolomic data revealed pathways associated with zingerone treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis, such as the glutathione metabolism and purine metabolism pathways. Combined with the joint analysis of transcriptomic data, our findings revealed that zingerone treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis also affects glutathione metabolism and is associated with the expression of the ferroptosis genes <italic toggle="yes">SAT1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">GPX4</italic>. Glutathione metabolism involves the catalytic reduction reaction of glutathione and <italic toggle="yes">NADPH</italic> through the action of the glutathione reductase core enzyme, forming oxidized glutathione and thus maintaining the balance of conversion between oxidized and reduced glutathione. This finding explains why zingerone can effectively ameliorate postmenopausal osteoporosis by fundamentally reversing abnormalities in glutathione metabolism. Moreover, the depletion of glutathione and increased expression of <italic toggle="yes">SAT1</italic>, coupled with decreased expression of <italic toggle="yes">GPX4</italic>, induce ferroptosis in mouse pancreatic tumour cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In addition to its antioxidant function, glutathione is considered an important ligand for intracellular iron ions and participates in iron metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. <italic toggle="yes">SAT1</italic> is a ferroptosis-related gene, and its overexpression is a key feature of ferroptosis, as it promotes ferroptosis by mediating the acetylation of spermidine and spermine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. <italic toggle="yes">GPX4</italic> is a glutathione peroxidase that maintains the redox balance within cells, protecting them from oxidative damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The present study revealed that after zingerone treatment, the levels of lipid peroxides and ROS increased significantly in osteoclast precursor cells. In addition, GPX4 activity decreased and glutathione accumulation increased, which increased sensitivity to ferroptosis, leading to an inability of these cells to utilize glutathione to alleviate ferroptosis. Similarly, other studies have indicated that upregulation of the SLC7A11 gene in cells leads to cysteine accumulation, causing an abnormal cell structure and osteoclast precursor cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The present findings suggest that zingerone induces ferroptosis in osteoclast precursor cells, which is related to glutathione metabolism mediated by SAT1 and GPX4. Increased SAT1 expression leads to lipid peroxidation and increased ROS levels, whereas decreased GPX4 expression weakens the ability of cells to clear ROS, resulting in an imbalance in glutathione metabolic homeostasis rather than a traditional antioxidant effect.</p><p id="Par23">A joint analysis was performed to further elucidate how zingerone regulates the expression of <italic toggle="yes">SAT1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">GPX4</italic>, and the results revealed that <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> is a common upstream regulator of both <italic toggle="yes">SAT1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">GPX4</italic>, suggesting that <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> is a target of zingerone in osteoclast precursor cells. <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> is associated primarily with cell cycle regulation and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

Recent research has identified <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> as one of the main regulators of ferroptosis. Studies of cholangiocarcinoma have indicated that the upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> expression inhibits <italic toggle="yes">GPX4</italic> activity, which leads to excessive oxidative stress in cholangiocarcinoma cells, thereby inducing ferroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

In the present study, molecular docking experiments revealed a strong binding affinity between zingerone and p53, which was further confirmed by affinity predictions showing the significant binding affinity of p53 for SAT1 and GPX4. Furthermore, zingerone increased the sensitivity of osteoclast precursor cells to ferroptosis and induced ferroptosis by inducing oxidative damage through p53. When p53 expression decreased, the increased sensitivity to ferroptosis induced by zingerone was abrogated by the inhibition of p53, further confirming that p53 may be a downstream target of zingerone in osteoclast precursor cells, independent of the traditional antioxidant properties of zingerone. This mechanism is associated with zingerone regulating SAT1 and GPX4 expression through p53, increasing sensitivity to ferroptosis and inducing ferroptosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p id="Par24">The mouse monocytic leukaemia cell line RAW264.7 was obtained from the Type Culture Collection affiliated with the Cell Bank of the&#160;Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Eighteen female C57BL/6&#8201;J mice (8 weeks old, weighing 20&#8211;25&#8201;g, MGI:2164831) were procured for the animal experiments and housed at the Department of Experimental Animal Science at China Medical University. The laboratory maintained controlled conditions, with a temperature of 20&#8211;26 degrees Celsius, atmospheric moisture levels of 40% to 70%, an ammonia concentration of 14&#8201;mg/m<sup>3</sup>, a noise level of 60&#8201;dB, and a 12&#8201;h light/dark cycle. The mice were provided unrestricted access to food and water. After a two-week acclimation period, the mice were randomly divided into three groups (comprising six subjects per cohort): the ovariectomy group (OVX), the zingerone treatment group (Zin), and the sham-operated control group (Sham). The mice in the OVX and Zin groups underwent bilateral ovariectomy under 2&#8211;3% isoflurane anaesthesia. Small incisions were made on both dorsolateral sides to expose the ovaries and surrounding fat pads. The oviducts were ligated, and the ovaries were carefully excised. The muscle layers were closed using absorbable sutures, and the skin was sutured with standard surgical thread. The mice in the Sham group underwent the same procedure without ovary removal. The Zin group received zingerone treatment postoperatively. All the mice were administered meloxicam subcutaneously (5&#8201;mg/kg/day) for 3 days after surgery for analgesia, and their behaviour was monitored daily to assess signs of pain or distress. Zingerone, dissolved in 0.9% saline to a final concentration of 2&#8201;mg/mL, was administered to the mice in the Zin group by oral gavage at a dose of 100&#8201;mg/kg body weight per day (equivalent to 1.25&#8201;mL for a 25&#8201;g mouse), starting three days after surgery. Gavage was performed using a sterile, flexible, ball-tipped feeding needle (20&#8201;G &#215; 38&#8201;mm) attached to a 2&#8201;mL syringe.
