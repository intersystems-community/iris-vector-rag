We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment involving ATT compared to treatment without ATT in these patients, with respect to uveitis resolution and reduction in the risk of relapse.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a single-blind, single-centre, phase 2 RCT at the uveitis clinic of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia, from August 16, 2021, to February 5, 2024. Seventy-six adults with newly diagnosed, active uveitis of undetermined cause and a positive IGRA were randomised 1:1 using block randomisation (block size 4) into two groups. Participants in the ATT group received an additional full course of ATT in addition to systemic corticosteroids. The control group received systemic corticosteroids without ATT. Investigators were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the complete resolution of uveitis six months after randomisation.

Over the subsequent follow-up period, complete uveitis resolution was observed in 34 and 24 participants assigned to the ATT and the control groups, respectively.

No randomised controlled trials were identified that evaluated the efficacy and safety of antitubercular therapy (ATT) in patients with uveitis of undetermined cause and positive TB immunoreactivity&#8212;patients who may represent a subset within the broader spectrum of ocular tuberculosis (TB) or TB-associated uveitis. Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), such as QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT), can identify individuals with TB infection, but its positivity does not necessarily indicate active disease. It is a dilemma to commence a full course of ATT in patients with uveitis of undetermined cause and IGRA positivity, as there is currently no prospective randomised study assessing the efficacy and safety of ATT in this patient.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec2"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="p0020">This is the first phase 2 randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of ATT in comparison to no ATT (e.g., systemic corticosteroids alone) in patients with uveitis of undetermined cause and IGRA positivity. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in complete uveitis resolution and a reduction in relapse rates who received ATT. While adverse effects were observed, the benefit of ATT was considered to outweigh its risks.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec3"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="p0025">In TB-endemic settings, these results support considering ATT as part of treatment strategy for uveitis of undetermined cause in patients with positive TB immunoreactivity test. With appropriate monitoring for adverse events, this approach could improve outcome and reduce the risk of uveitis relapse. The preliminary data from this study could inform future, larger-scale studies and guide treatment decisions.</p></sec></boxed-text>

According to the 2024 report by the World Health Organization (WHO), the incidence of TB in Indonesia was 387 cases per 100,000 population.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Consequently, Indonesia is classified as a high TB burden country and ranks as the second highest globally.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In countries with a high incidence of TB, such as Indonesia, uveitis associated with concurrent active systemic TB accounts for 8% of newly referred uveitis cases in our setting.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Interestingly, among patients with uveitis of undetermined cause, some exhibited TB immunoreactivity as detectable through interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) or tuberculin skin tests (TST). Up to 40% of all referred uveitis patients at our centre were classified as having uveitis of undetermined cause with a positive IGRA.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The clinical characteristics of these patients revealed that the majority did not present with the classical manifestations typically associated with TB-related uveitis.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Importantly, more than one-third of the affected eyes were already categorised as &#8220;blind&#8221; at the time of initial presentation to our centre.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> In the absence of confirmatory evidence of active TB, these patients were often treated empirically for <italic toggle="yes">presumed</italic> TB,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> underscoring both the diagnostic uncertainty and the serious risk of irreversible vision loss.

Other clinical presentations, including chronic anterior uveitis or panuveitis, were considered potential indications for ATT in high TB-endemic regions; however, additional supporting evidence, such as signs of healed or old TB lesions on chest radiography, in combination with a positive TB immunoreactivity test, is necessary for treatment initiation. In light of this, we conducted a phase 2 randomised controlled trial to determine whether ATT would eventually improve outcomes compared to treatment without ATT in terms of uveitis resolution and relapse, during subsequent follow-up of patients with uveitis of undetermined cause who were showing TB immunoreactivity, based on IGRA test positivity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="p0045">This single-blinded, phase 2 randomised controlled trial was conducted at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, a tertiary eye hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia.

The internist-pulmonologist was unaware of the randomisation and provided all patients with the necessary information and counselling regarding ATT prescription and initiation. Following the initial consultation, a research manager who had the first access to the ATT collection informed participants whether ATT would be initiated, in accordance with the randomisation procedure. Routine follow-ups were scheduled for week 2, month 1, and every month until the six-month follow-up at the outpatient uveitis clinic.

The time between the actual study start date and the enrolment of the first participant was used to collaborate with our multidisciplinary team (logistics, hospital admission, pharmacy, internal medicine department, diagnostic labs, arrangement of in-house QFT tests, etc.), as participants needed to undergo screenings and multiple visits to different departments before their eligibility could be determined. We consider these activities as part of the study, as the hospital regards them as research-related due to certain adjustments made to routine clinical care. The participant enrolment period spanned from August 16, 2021, to February 5, 2024, with the last follow-up for secondary outcome measurement occurring on November 30, 2024. The extended recruitment period was due to the post-COVID recovery of the healthcare system and the inclusion criteria requiring participants&#8217; commitment for regular follow-up.

All included participants received corticosteroids or anti-inflammatory drugs at the discretion of the attending uveitis specialists. Generally, topical corticosteroids were prescribed when significant anterior chamber and anterior vitreous inflammation were observed. Local treatments, such as parabulbar injections of triamcinolone acetate, were allowed if deemed necessary by the attending uveitis specialists, who were unaware of the randomisation. There were no restrictions on topical or local treatments throughout the entire follow-up period, including surgical interventions, if indicated.</p><p id="p0075">A two-independent proportion sample size calculation was conducted. Based on the Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Trial in non-infectious uveitis, the proportion of uveitis patients with active disease at six months following treatment was found to be 44%.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> We assumed a 30% difference in uveitis resolution between the two groups. Using a Z&#945; of 1.96 and a Z&#946; of 0.84 (for a two-sided significance level of 5% and 80% power), the estimated sample size required for each treatment group was 35 participants. We increased this calculated sample size by 10%, resulting in a total of 39 participants in each treatment group.</p><sec id="sec2.4.1"><title>ATT group</title><p id="p0080">The full course of ATT comprised two months in the intensive phase, followed by seven months in the continuation phase. During the intensive phase, a fixed-dose combination (FDC) was administered, with each tablet containing 150 mg of rifampicin, 75 mg of isoniazid, 400 mg of pyrazinamide, and 275 mg of ethambutol. The continuation phase used an FDC that included rifampicin and isoniazid. The ATT dosage was determined based on body weight: individuals weighing 30&#8211;37 kg received 2 tablets; those weighing 38&#8211;54 kg received 3 tablets; individuals weighing 55&#8211;70 kg received 4 tablets; and those over 70 kg received 5 tablets. During the intensive phase, ATT was administered once daily, while in the continuation phase, it was given three times per week. Participant monitoring, including assessments of adverse events and laboratory parameters, was conducted by the Department of Internal Medicine.</p><p id="p0085">In addition to ATT, selected participants were prescribed local or systemic corticosteroids, including oral methylprednisolone, starting at a dosage of 0.8 mg/kg of body weight per day and tapered gradually (e.g., every three days or weekly) based on the severity of intraocular inflammation observed during presentation and follow-up visits. The decision to initiate combination treatment or to add systemic corticosteroids during follow-up was made by the uveitis specialist, who was unaware whether the patients were in the ATT or control group. The dosing of systemic corticosteroids was not adjusted when combined with ATT and was therefore similar to that of the control group (see below).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4.2"><title>Control group</title><p id="p0090">The treatment for the control group primarily involved systemic corticosteroids without ATT. Local corticosteroids were prescribed according to the standard care by the attending uveitis specialists and tailored to the severity of the intraocular inflammation. Additionally, all participants in this group received oral methylprednisolone at a dosage of 0.8 mg/kg of body weight per day (maximum of 56 mg/day), which was tapered gradually based on the intraocular inflammation observed. Tapering of oral methylprednisolone involved reducing the dose by 8 mg for doses above 20 mg and by 4 mg for doses below 20 mg. All patients receiving systemic corticosteroids, including those in the ATT group, were also prescribed vitamin D, calcium supplements, and gastric protectors (e.g., omeprazole or antacids). Treatment switching could be requested by study participants at their discretion and was to be communicated to the research manager, upon which the treatment regimen was adjusted accordingly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="p0095">Participants underwent clinical assessments at baseline, week 2, month 1, and monthly until month 6. The research manager maintained close contact with participants through phone calls to remind them of their scheduled visits. Subsequent follow-up reminders after six months were provided to participants by the research manager, although these extended visits were not mandatory. Clinical assessments included standard ophthalmological evaluations using slit-lamp biomicroscopy to quantify intraocular inflammation and any relevant pathology. Ocular imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography, or ultrasound, could be performed in addition to the standard ophthalmological examination if necessary. To maintain masking, participants were instructed not to disclose their ATT intake to the attending uveitis specialists assigned as clinical graders. At each visit, the research manager accompanied the patient to ensure trial integrity. The uveitis specialist graded the inflammation and adjusted the dose of corticosteroids accordingly. The team of uveitis specialists consisted of five individuals, and each patient was not restricted to follow-up with a single designated uveitis specialist (the preliminary agreement on disease activity based on anterior chamber cells showed a kappa value of 0.64).</p><p id="p0100">The primary outcome measure was the complete resolution of uveitis at the patient level (both eyes) at six months. Criteria for complete uveitis resolution applied to both eyes, in cases with bilateral uveitis, included: (1) fewer than or equal to 0.5+ anterior chamber cells according to the Standardised Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) grading system, fewer than or equal to 0.5+ vitreous haze based on clinical grading using the NEI (National Eye Institute) scale, and no active retinal or choroidal lesions (new increases in size and number, as well as changes in margins, as assessed by the attending uveitis specialist); and (2) no more than 7.5 mg of oral prednisone daily (i.e., methylprednisolone at 6 mg or less daily) and fewer than or equal to 2 drops of prednisolone acetate 1% (or equivalent) per day. These were in line with the previous criteria to define treatment response in uveitis.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> These criteria had to be maintained for at least 90 days following the visit when the first complete uveitis resolution was recorded. If there was insufficient follow-up after resolution, maintained uveitis resolution was still considered, as patients were contacted via telephonic consultation to confirm the absence of persistent symptoms or new complaints during the missed visits. Patients who achieved uveitis inactivity at any time within the 6-month period were considered resolved, provided that no disease activity occurred during the subsequent 90 days from the start of inactivity and all other criteria were met. Thus, resolution at 6 months does not necessarily require inactivity to have begun before month 3. Participants who met criterion 1 but not criterion 2 were classified as having partial uveitis resolution, and for the primary endpoint classification, they were considered to have non-complete uveitis resolution. Secondary outcomes included the details of treatment failure (partial resolution or non-responsive), time to uveitis resolution, uveitis relapse following complete resolution, and eye-level outcomes, which consisted of the differences in visual acuity between baseline and month 6, as well as the incidence of secondary glaucoma (e.g., occurrences of increased intraocular pressure (IOP) above 21 mmHg in at least two consecutive visits that necessitated prescription of IOP-lowering medications). Visual acuity was considered to increase if the difference in best-corrected visual acuity between month 6 and baseline visits (measured with Snellen, in decimal equivalent) was equal to or greater than 0.1, stable if within the range of &#8722;0.1 to 0.1, and decreased if less than &#8722;0.1. If any cataract or vitreoretinal surgery was performed before the six-month follow-up, the last recorded visual acuity prior to the surgery was used. Uveitis relapse was defined as any worsening of ocular inflammation (including a two-step increase in anterior chamber or vitreous cells as per the SUN grading system) or the occurrence of clinically new inflammatory activity (such as choroidal or retinal lesions) that necessitated a modification of local or systemic uveitis treatment after a minimum of 90 days of complete uveitis resolution at the patient level.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> As per its definition, time to relapse was calculated from the first visit showing inactive uveitis (uveitis resolution, rather than the six-month time point) until the first notification of uveitis relapse. Any symptoms reported during telephonic follow-up were not directly counted as relapse events, as participants were required to attend a clinic visit for relapse to be formally defined according to the study criteria. Otherwise, such cases were right-censored accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="p0105">We developed a statistical analysis plan before the final analysis (see details in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>). No interim analysis was conducted. All analyses were first conducted using the intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. The ITT population included all participants who underwent randomisation, regardless of any treatment switching that occurred. At the six-month visit (&#177;28 days), outcome data were missing for 1 participant in the ATT group and 7 participants in the control group. These missing values were addressed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation for the primary analysis, as we relied on objective clinical assessment during clinic visits. Telephonic follow-up, as described in the previous section, was conducted to assess the general condition and explore reasons for missed visits. Based on these interviews, we determined that LOCF remained appropriate as the primary analytical approach, as most participants did not report meaningful changes in symptoms compared to their last clinic visit; in 6 of 8 participants with missing six-month data, the most recent visit had occurred at month four or later. Nevertheless, as a sensitivity analysis, multiple imputation (MI) was conducted under the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption. Ten imputed datasets were generated using fully conditional specification, with treatment group and baseline clinical characteristics included in the imputation model. Logistic regression was then used to analyse the pooled dataset, accounting for the imputed values. To further supplement this analysis, per-protocol analysis was also performed. The per-protocol population included all participants who were randomised, excluding those who deviated from the treatment protocols. This included individuals who received treatment modifications due to adverse events, non-compliance, or treatment crossover (these participants were completely excluded from the per-protocol analysis). Missing primary outcome data were handled using the LOCF method in the per-protocol analysis. Adherence to treatment was assessed by the internist-immunologist through logbook documentation and tablet count review. We also performed an analysis accounting for treatment regimen switches, presenting this as an analysis by last treatment received. This analysis was conducted only for the uveitis relapse outcome following resolution. The results of the two analyses, with and without adjustment for switching (analysis by last treatment received), were reported. However, we consider the ITT analysis (without adjustment for switching) to be more appropriate to evaluate the primary outcome, given that the purpose of the study was to compare the two strategies according to the treatment received at the time of randomisation. For the analysis of the uveitis relapse outcome, we also stratified participants in the ATT group based on whether they received ATT in combination with systemic corticosteroids or without it, resulting in three treatment groups. Analysis by last treatment received was performed with recalculation of the six-month follow-up time based on the actual treatment received, beginning from the start of their actual treatment.</p><p id="p0110">Baseline characteristics were summarised according to trial group for the ITT populations. The primary outcome analysis focused on the proportion of complete uveitis resolution and the corresponding relative risk between the ATT and control groups. Cox proportional-hazards models along with Kaplan&#8211;Meier estimates were used to estimate any uveitis resolution (partial or complete, whenever the first was recorded) between the ATT and control groups. For uveitis relapse outcomes, we first identified all participants who achieved complete uveitis resolution, regardless of the follow-up time. The Cox regression analysis used individual right censoring, and no data imputation, either LOCF or multiple imputation, was used to estimate the mean time to uveitis resolution. The number of participants experiencing any adverse events was also reported. A <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

In the ATT group, four participants from the ITT population were excluded from the per-protocol analysis: three due to non-adherence to the ATT regimen (defined as missing more than two weeks of prescribed drugs) and one whose ATT regimen was adjusted due to severe adverse events. In the control group, nine participants were excluded from the per-protocol analysis: eight who opted to receive ATT instead of continuing with systemic corticosteroids only, and one who was non-adherent to the corticosteroid treatment regimen. As a result, 33 participants in the ATT group and 30 in the control group were included in the per-protocol analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). No study participants discontinued the trial (dropped out), including through withdrawal.<fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Screening, randomisation, and analysis. Among patients initially receiving steroids alone, eight were later switched to ATT. All randomised patients were included in the primary ITT analysis. Per-protocol analysis was conducted based on the actual treatment received, excluding participants with protocol deviations (treatment switching, deviation, and non-adherence).

In both groups, uveitis symptoms in nearly half of the participants had lasted for less than three months. We calculated the cumulative systemic corticosteroid intake (prednisone equivalent; cortiser.ser.es/) during the six-month observation period. The ATT group had a lower dosage compared to the control group (median: 0 mg, Q1&#8211;Q3: 0&#8211;1170 mg vs. 3275 mg, Q1&#8211;Q3: 2445&#8211;3960 mg; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).

In the extended follow-up period beyond six months, the rate of recurrence or relapse of the uveitis was less in the ATT treatment arm. However, careful monitoring for adverse events is essential in patients receiving ATT, as well as those receiving systemic corticosteroids. Based on our findings, we are of the opinion that the benefits of ATT outweigh the risks.</p><p id="p0160">Treating patients with uveitis of undetermined cause with positive for TB immunoreactivity and no clinical signs of active TB remains challenging.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Clinicians are generally reluctant to start ATT on positive TB testing alone,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> in accordance to the current recommendations.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This dilemma is heightened when uveitis is non-responsive to corticosteroids or when biologics such as anti-TNF therapy are considered.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> However, initiating anti-TNF treatment in recalcitrant cases of uveitis of undetermined cause with a positive IGRA is problematic if ATT has not been initiated first, as the risk of active TB disease is significantly increased.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Hence, our study provides evidence that initial treatment incorporating ATT yields more favourable outcomes in this patient spectrum, particularly in high TB-burden settings. The recent European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendation mandates TB screening in autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases before initiating immunosuppressants (including glucocorticoids). ATT, whether as prophylaxis or a full course regimen, is recommended.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Although no TB reactivation was observed during follow-up, full course of ATT herein demonstrated benefits in uveitis control. It is worth mentioning that, although some participants in the ATT group received a combination with systemic corticosteroids, no corticosteroid dosage adjustment was made. Rifampicin is known to reduce the bioavailability of glucocorticoids,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> and therefore, the uveitis resolution observed in the ATT group is perceived to be mainly attributed to the effect of ATT.</p><p id="p0165">While ATT showed superior outcomes in our trial, a cautious interpretation is still warranted. The current study was conducted at a single centre in Indonesia, where TB prevalence is high. In high TB-burden settings, the likelihood of uveitis being a true manifestation of extrapulmonary TB is greater than in low-burden settings.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> It is also important to note that the effectiveness of the standard ATT regimen observed in this trial may, in part, be attributed to the relatively low proportion (approximately 2&#8211;3%) of newly diagnosed patients with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB in our setting who have multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB), which can reasonably be extrapolated to this context.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Next, we observed that treatment with systemic corticosteroids alone, without ATT, might lead to a tendency for slightly faster initial uveitis resolution (partial or complete), even though the difference is not statistically significant. However, at six months, fewer patients in this group, compared to the ATT group, were able to taper treatment to 8 mg prednisone equivalent or two drops or fewer of prednisolone acetate daily. Once tapering below these thresholds and achieving complete uveitis resolution, uveitis relapse was more frequently observed in this non-ATT treated group. This suggests that intraocular inflammation may not be fully controlled without ATT, highlighting the importance of assessing treatment outcomes not only by uveitis resolution end point but also by the risk of uveitis relapse over an extended follow-up period. Nevertheless, we observed that half of the patients in the control group, who did not receive ATT, still achieved complete uveitis resolution. Additionally, the varied adverse events observed following ATT treatment emphasise the need for close monitoring and follow-up visits in both uveitis clinics and with internists or pulmonologists throughout the treatment period. Based on our findings, we consider that the benefits of ATT outweigh the risks. However, in settings with low TB prevalence or transmission, where avoiding potential side effects may be preferable, withholding unnecessary ATT might offer greater benefit. Thus, the generalisability of our results may be limited in settings with lower TB prevalence and transmission.</p><p id="p0170">The current trial has some limitations. First, referral bias may impact the generalisability of our findings in general settings, as the trial was conducted at a single tertiary eye care centre. We aimed to minimise this by including only patients without prior high-dose systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants that could alter disease progression. Second, we could only conduct a single-blind trial due to the lack of available placebo for the FDC ATT, meaning that participants were not masked, and no placebo was used. However, the attending uveitis specialist who served as the clinical grader determining the studied outcomes was masked; no participant-reported outcomes were included. Third, the obligatory baseline consultations with the internist-pulmonologist which included counselling on ATT initiation, which may partly explain why eight patients withdrew from the control group allocation. This decision could have also been influenced by their perceived severity of ophthalmic conditions. Consequently, we supplemented our primary analysis with per-protocol analysis, as well as analysis last treatment received, to assess the consequences for our trial results. In this trial, we could not assess whether a shorter duration of ATT (six months) would also result in a reduction of uveitis relapse compared to a nine-month duration, as all patients ultimately completed nine-month ATT regimen. Even though ATT is administered for nine months, the choice of 6 months as the primary time point is based on the majority of reported outcomes for ocular TB treatment. Moreover, we supplemented our analysis with a longer follow-up period as a secondary study outcome (e.g., relapse). We did not perform a dedicated analysis of the rate of systemic corticosteroid tapering, which may have influenced the outcomes. In terms of visual acuity outcomes, no differences were observed between the two treatment allocations; however, we did not assess for possible optic nerve toxicity related to ethambutol use.</p><p id="p0175">A strength of our trial is its direct comparison between ATT and non-ATT treatment approaches as a first-line option for patients with uveitis of undetermined cause and positive IGRA&#8212;a comparison that was not yet explored and reported in current literature. Randomisation prevents indication-for-treatment bias and avoids potential baseline imbalances in both recognised and unrecognised confounders. This is important because prior observational retrospective studies may have biases, particularly in cases where patients with more severe disease received ATT.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Previous findings from this retrospective study indicated that, ATT was more often prescribed in patients with a more severe uveitis presentation, which were also the patients experiencing a uveitis relapse more often.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref></p><p id="p0180">We did not analyse the agreement between QFT and TST in this trial, however we believe our findings remain applicable in settings where TST is the only available TB immunoreactivity test.</p><p id="p0185">Given the preliminary nature of this phase 2 trial conducted at a single centre with a limited sample size, future studies should evaluate the efficacy and safety of ATT in IGRA-positive patients with uveitis of undetermined cause using a multi-centre design. Ideally, such studies should include diverse geographical settings, particularly low TB-endemic regions, to enhance generalizability and statistical power. Nonetheless, our results provide an important foundation for future research in this area. Additionally, the identification of biomarkers for better precision in determining which patients would benefit most from ATT is warranted.</p><p id="p0190">In conclusion, we observed that an initial treatment approach incorporating a full course of ATT in IGRA-positive patients with uveitis of undetermined cause was beneficial for achieving complete uveitis resolution at six months and reducing uveitis relapse during follow-up after the initial six months. Adverse events were frequently encountered with either ATT or systemic corticosteroids treatment, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in monitoring of treatment course.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Contributors</title><p id="p0195">RLDN and IP contributed equally to the study and shared first authorship.
