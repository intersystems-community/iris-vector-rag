FTMH can be categorized into idiopathic MHs, where the cause remains unknown, and secondary MHs, which are associated with identifiable factors such as high myopia, ocular trauma, or vitreomacular traction secondary to other retinal diseases.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The development of idiopathic MHs is thought to be associated with pathological vitreoretinal traction at the central macula. Tangential and anteroposterior vitreomacular traction can contribute to a more extensive, persistent, and intense set of forces on the perifoveal region, ultimately leading to FTMH formation.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>&#8211;</sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revealed various mechanisms of FTMH formation, which occur through tractional disruption of the inner layer of the foveola, leading to outer lamellar holes, and/or the external limiting membrane (ELM), resulting in degenerative lamellar holes. These disruptions are often accompanied by cystic cavities in the foveal walls, a consequence of impaired water clearance by the retinal pigment epithelium. The size of these cystic cavities is closely correlated with FTMH width, providing critical insights for diagnosis and monitoring.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Thus, theoretically, the resolution of cystic cavities indicates the healing process of FTMHs.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Recent advancements in medical therapy suggest that small-diameter FTMHs with macular cystoid hydration can be treated effectively with topical agents after the resolution of cystic cavities. Wang et al.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> demonstrated that a combination of topical steroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors achieved successful closure in select FTMH cases. Of course, progressive visual impairment and metamorphopsia typically necessitate surgical intervention.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>The hydration theory explains how pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) combined with intraocular gas tamponade facilitates FTMH closure. The gas bubble isolates the macular defect from vitreous fluid, reducing hydration at the site of the hole. Simultaneously, the postoperative facedown position enhances the activity of M&#252;ller cells and retinal pigment epithelium pumps, allowing effective fluid clearance and resolution of cystic cavities, ultimately promoting macular healing.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Despite the high success rates of PPV, limitations such as the need for strict postoperative positioning and temporary visual impairment during gas tamponade have spurred interest in alternative approaches. The use of biological glue with anti-inflammatory properties to seal the MH appears to be a feasible option. Building on prior research, this study explores the innovative combination of internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and inverted ILM flap techniques with the application of a sodium hyaluronate hydrogel mixed with triamcinolone acetonide (TA). This approach eliminates the need for gas tamponade, used balanced salt solution (BSS) tamponade, and required only a postoperative nonstrict supine position in patients with FTMH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>This study, approved by the Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital Ethics Committee and adhering to the Declaration of Helsinki, was conducted on consecutive FTMH patients undergoing PPV at a tertiary ophthalmic hospital from January to August 2024.</p><p>Patients with FTMH requiring surgery for progressive vision loss or metamorphopsia and an axial length (AL) of less than 28 mm were included in the viscoelastic-assisted (VA) group.

This study compared the underwater adhesion of cohesive (IVIZ; Bausch &amp; Lomb, Shanghai, China) and cohesive&#8211;dispersive (DisCoVisc; Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX) OVDs. IVIZ, a medical sodium hyaluronate, is a 1.7% cohesive OVD used during eye surgeries to maintain the anterior chamber, capsular bag, and so on. It has a pH range of 6.8 to 7.6, ensuring biocompatibility with ocular tissues.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> DisCoVisc was introduced to the market in 2005, which is a combination of two main components: 1.6% sodium hyaluronate and 4% chondroitin sulfate.

The syringe was shaken gently up and down to ensure uniform dispersion of the TA particles within the viscoelastic agent, as previously described by Fan et al.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> During this process, air became incorporated into the solution, resulting in the formation of uniformly distributed microbubbles&#8212;&#8212;an indicator that the TA-OVD mixture was thoroughly and homogeneously blended. A 10-mL culture flask, simulating the human eye, was filled with BSS and overlaid with perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) at the bottom. A 0.1-mL TA-IVIZ patch and a TA-DisCoVisc patch were injected beneath the PFCL. Subsequently, the PFCL was aspirated using a needle, facilitating direct contact between the patches and the BSS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;1</xref>). As shown in&#160;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>, the TA-OVD patch adhered to the bottom of the flask. When the flask was placed upright (standing vertically), it simulated the supine position of a human body. Conversely, when the flask was laid flat (horizontally), it simulated the upright (standing) human position. Then the flask was laid flat for 120 minutes to simulate the upright human position, and patch displacement was observed at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. To provide a preliminary quantitative assessment, a simplified approach was used by measuring the vertical displacement of the upper edge of the patch at specific time points. Each experimental condition was repeated three times, and the differences in displacement between the two groups were analyzed statistically.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The steps of in vitro experiment.

If cataract was present, phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation was performed simultaneously. All patients underwent minimal vitrectomy, defined as removal of the posterior vitreous within the vascular arcades after TA injection to visualize the vitreous cortex, followed by careful mechanical induction of posterior vitreous detachment using a vitrectomy cutter. Indocyanine green (25 mg, Dandong Yichuang Pharmaceutical Co., Dandong City, China) was applied to stain the ILM for 5 seconds.</p><p>In the VA group, PFCL was injected until it reached the vascular arcade. The ILM around the hole was peeled, a semicircular ILM flap at least 1 optic disc distance to the MH margin was created by peeling approximately 180&#176; of the ILM around the MH, with the hinge positioned at the inferior edge. The flap was inverted gently to cover the MH in a downward orientation. The TA-IVIZ patch was applied beneath the PFCL over the inverted ILM flap, The amount of TA-IVIZ patch injection was determined according to the size of the inverted ILM flap (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;2</xref>). After removal of PFCL, the procedure was completed with the infusion of BSS. The scleral incisions were left unsutured and gently massaged with cotton-tipped applicators.

Patients underwent minimal posterior pole vitrectomy with ILM peeling, an inverted ILM flap technique, TA-IVIZ patching, and BSS tamponade, along with a nonstandard supine positioning postoperatively. When compared with a standard surgical approach involving conventional vitrectomy, ILM peeling, inverted ILM flap technique, gas tamponade, and prone positioning, the two methods showed similar outcomes in terms of MH closure and improvements in BCVA. These findings suggest that the combination of a TA-IVIZ patch and BSS tamponade offers a viable alternative to traditional approaches. Although preliminary results are promising, further studies with larger, more diverse populations are needed to confirm its efficacy.</p><p>The pathogenesis and management of MHs remain controversial. The combined tractional&#8211;hydration theory and dynamic forces theory have been proposed to explain its development.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Wang et al.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> demonstrated that the size of a MH was directly correlated with the likelihood of closure after topical medical therapy; each 10-&#181;m reduction in size increased the odds of closure by 1.2. FTMHs smaller than 200 &#181;m achieved a 72.2% closure rate with topical therapy, especially in cases without vitreomacular traction but with macular cystoid edema. Additionally, the rates of MH narrowing and reduction in central foveal thickness were key predictors of drop therapy success.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> However, for larger MHs, vitrectomy and adjunctive therapies were necessary. Therefore, TA was combined with OVDs to leverage its anti-inflammatory properties, aiming to reduce central foveal thickness and promote better MH closure.</p><p>After Eckardt et al. introduced ILM peeling, it effectively improved anatomical and functional outcomes, with success rates of 80% to 95%.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> A meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) revealed that the inverted ILM flap technique resulted in better anatomical closure rates and improved postoperative vision at 3 months compared with ILM peeling alone.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Based on these findings, our study applied vitrectomy combined with ILM peeling and inverted ILM flap technique in all patients. Gas tamponade is a mainstream choice, which aids in MH closure by preventing fluid leakage through the hole from the vitreous cavity, promoting the reabsorption of subretinal fluid through the retinal pigment epithelium. Additionally, the tamponade generates surface tension between the retina and the gas bubble, which helps to pull the edges of the hole together. This process supports glial cell migration, facilitating closure of the gap by creating a favorable surface for cellular activity.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> However, gas tamponade typically requires prone positioning postoperatively, particularly in phakic eyes. Although meta-analyses suggest that this maneuver may not be necessary for smaller MHs, further RCTs are needed to confirm these findings.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>&#8211;</sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Our study used the adhesive properties of the TA-IVIZ patch, which also effectively isolates the vitreous cavity from the hole, preventing communication between them.

Postoperatively, patients were not required to maintain a strict prone position and could instead remain in a nonstrict supine position. Compared with the traditional approach of PPV combined with ILM peeling, inverted ILM flap, gas tamponade, and postoperative prone positioning, there were no differences between the two surgical methods in terms of MH healing rate and postoperative improvements in BCVA. Therefore, minimal posterior pole vitrectomy, ILM peeling, inverted ILM flap, the TA-IVIZ patch, BSS tamponade, and nonstrict supine position may provide a promising alternative for the treatment of FTMHs.</p><p>The term OVDs for viscoelastic substances was introduced in the beginning of this century, which are a class of nonactive, clear, gel-like chemical compounds with viscous and elastic properties.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> One of the new applications of OVDs in ophthalmology is in PPV. Initial attempts were made in 2013 and Hirata et al.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> used dispersive OVD (Viscoat; Alcon Japan) as a retinal patch after vitrectomy surgery in rabbit retinal tear models, no postoperative inflammation was seen and all rabbit eyes treated with an OVD achieved patching of the retinal tear for more than 3 days. Moreover, Liu et al.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> conducted an exploratory study on MH treatment using DisCoVisc to cover the inverted ILM flap, combined with BSS tamponade, achieving a 100% closure rate. Thus, we are exploring the use of OVDs mixed with TA to cover MHs to isolate MHs from the fluid in the vitreous cavity while promoting the disappearance of MH edema. To identify the optimal TA-OVDs for covering the inverted ILM flap without displacement, we conducted an in vitro experiment comparing TA-IVIZ and TA- DisCoVisc. The results demonstrated that, after placing the culture flask horizontally to simulate the upright position of the human body, TA-DisCoVisc exhibited significantly greater displacement after 30 minutes. Therefore, TA-IVIZ was selected for clinical trials. Moreover, we initially attempted to directly inject the TA-OVDs patch onto the bottom of a flask filled with BSS in the in vitro experiment. However, the results indicated that the TA-OVDs patch did not adhere well owing to the excessively moist environment and gradually floated in the BSS over time (<xref rid="tvst-14-9-35_s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). To prevent air introduction throughout the whole procedure, we modified our approach by incorporating PFCL. As shown in&#160;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;3</xref>, this adjustment enabled the TA-OVD patch to adhere effectively to the target area. Consequently, PFCL was introduced into the surgical procedure.</p><p>In our surgical approach, the most critical step is ensuring that the TA-IVIZ patch adheres to the inverted ILM flap and retina. The macula and inverted ILM flap are isolated with BSS via PFCL before the TA-IVIZ is injected. Injecting TA-IVIZ between the PFCL and the retinal surface helps to prevent adhesion loss owing to excess moisture.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> In cases of successful closure, facilitated by BSS tamponade, we could clearly observe the inverted ILM remaining in place. Within a short period, we documented changes in each retinal layer and the recovery of the ellipsoid zone. The sequence of healing was consistent with that reported in the literature, beginning with the ELM, followed by the outer nuclear layer, and finally the ellipsoid zone. However, owing to the addition of TA in the patch, macular edema resolved rapidly, leading to a shorter healing time compared with previously reported findings.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> However, on the first postoperative day, displacement of the TA-IVIZ patch and the inverted ILM flap was observed in five patients, resulting in direct communication between the BSS and the hole. Consequently, these MHs did not heal. Based on the results of the in vitro experiments, after placing the flask horizontally to simulate the upright position of the human body, the TA-IVIZ patch exhibited slight movement after 30 minutes. Therefore, we recommend that postoperative patients maintain a supine position, limiting upright activities to 30 minutes daily. Prolonged upright positioning risks TA-IVIZ and inverted ILM flap displacement, thereby reducing the success rate of MH closure.</p><p>Limitations of this study are as follows. First, the quantification of patch displacement in the in vitro experiment was based on a simplified method, in which only the vertical displacement of the upper margin was measured over time. In future studies, we plan to use image analysis tools to objectively measure the speed and pattern of patch displacement. Second, this is an exploratory investigation, and the findings were compared only with retrospective case data. Our conclusions are preliminary and RCTs are needed to confirm noninferiority. Third, concerning postoperative positioning, we recommend that patients maintain a supine position after surgery; upright activities should be limited to 30 minutes at a time. Fourth, although gas was avoided to reduce cataract and IOP risks during the surgical procedure, TA may still promote cataract progression, especially in phakic eyes. The use of PFCL adds to surgical cost and carries a risk of residual intraocular bubbles, which should be considered a limitation of the technique. Finally, the mixing of TA with OVDs may alter the properties of OVDs, such as their adhesiveness and cohesiveness, warranting further research to elucidate these effects. Moreover, developing a hydrogel with improved adhesive properties and integrated anti-inflammatory characteristics may represent a promising direction for future research.</p><p>This novel approach provides an effective alternative to conventional techniques, achieving similar outcomes while improving patient comfort and minimizing postoperative risks. However, additional RCTs are essential to validate its effectiveness. It may be a promising direction in further that a hydrogel with excellent adhesive properties and integrated anti-inflammatory characteristics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="tvst-14-9-35_s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplement 1</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="tvst-14-9-35_s001.pdf" id="d67e693" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="tvst-14-9-35_s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplement 2</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="tvst-14-9-35_s002.pdf" id="d67e697" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="tvst-14-9-35_s003" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplement 3</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="tvst-14-9-35_s003.pdf" id="d67e701" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Supported by Sichuan Science and Technology Program (MZGC20240078), Research Fund of Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital (2024QNPY), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62376173), Health Science Research Project of Sichuan Province (ZH2024-201).</p><p content-type="COI-statement">Disclosure: <bold>Y.
