This study aimed to analyse the demographic, clinical, and outcome data of pediatric lymphoma patients, compare the characteristics of the HL and NHL subtypes, and evaluate treatment outcomes. A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted at An-Najah National University Hospital (NNUH) in Palestine from 2013 to 2023. Seventy-five pediatric patients (&#8804;&#8201;18 years) newly diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were included, and data from electronic medical records were used. Follow-up data were analysed via Kaplan&#8211;Meier survival curves to determine event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OAS).This study revealed a male predominance in both NHL (1.9:1) and HL (1.3:1) patients, with a mean age of 9 years for NHL patients and 10 years for HL patients. The majority of patients were from the West Bank (56%) or Gaza (44%). NHL patients commonly presented with GI symptoms (31.7%), whereas HL patients (70.6%) presented with neck masses. B symptoms were more common in HL patients (55.9%). The tumor stage also differed, with NHL often being stage III and HL being stage II. The predominant subtypes were Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma (BL) for NHL and classical nodular sclerosis for HL. Overall survival was 96%, with 4% mortality. During the follow-up period (mean 26.5&#8201;&#177;&#8201;18 months), 84% of the patients had events, with 86.7% of patients remaining event-free. Relapse occurred in 13.3% of patients, predominantly in the NHL group, and the prevalence of OAS was 96%. The 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 85.1%, and the 2-year overall survival (OAS) rate was 96.6%, as estimated via Kaplan&#8210;Meier survival analysis. Our study provides insights into the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of pediatric lymphoma patients in Palestine. Pediatric lymphoma is more common in males and primarily affects children over 10 years of age. HL is less prevalent, has a higher survival rate, and most commonly presents with a neck mass. In contrast, NHL is more common, is associated with higher relapse and mortality rates, and often presents with gastrointestinal symptoms. Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma (BL) is the most common NHL subtype and is not strongly associated with B symptoms. These findings emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and continuous follow-up in optimizing treatment outcomes. Further studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up periods are needed to validate these findings and assess long-term survival and cure rates.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-11278-2.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Lymphoma</kwd><kwd>Pediatric patients</kwd><kwd>Treatment outcome</kwd><kwd>Retrospective studies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Paediatric cancer</kwd><kwd>Neoplasm staging</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par41">Lymphoma, a malignancy affecting the lymphatic system, ranks as the third most prevalent cancer among children.

Survival outcomes have significantly improved in high-income countries, with the 5-year relative survival rate of HL increasing to 99% and that of NHL increasing to 85&#8211;95%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, with relapse being the principal cause of treatment failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In contrast, children in Palestine face considerable challenges in terms of diagnosis and treatment because of the fragmented healthcare systems between the West Bank and Gaza, frequent restrictions on patient movement, and variable access to oncological medications. These barriers can result in delayed diagnosis, interrupted chemotherapy protocols, and suboptimal follow-up, which are factors that may negatively impact outcomes. Despite these challenges, very few studies have examined pediatric lymphoma within this unique sociopolitical and healthcare context.</p><p id="Par44">Although regional studies on pediatric hematologic cancers exist, most focus on leukemia rather than lymphoma. For example, studies from An-Najah National University Hospital (NNUH) in Palestine and Gaza City have reported mainly on pediatric leukemia, with limited data on lymphoma treatment and outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In neighboring regions, a higher incidence of BL has been noted in Gaza and the West Bank, but specific treatment outcomes for pediatric lymphoma are scarce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Research from Israel on pediatric NHL has shown better survival rates due to access to advanced care, although these findings may not be fully applicable to Palestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par45">Although HL and NHL differ in biology and treatment, we present their characteristics side-by-side only for descriptive clarity while preserving analytical separation.</p><p id="Par46">This study aims to address this gap by focusing specifically on pediatric lymphoma in Palestine and analysing the clinical features and short-term outcomes of pediatric lymphoma patients treated at NNUH during our follow-up period. NNUH is located in Nablus, in the northern West Bank, and serves as a referral center for pediatric oncology cases from both the West Bank and Gaza.</p><p id="Par47">Given the geopolitical fragmentation and unequal distribution of cancer services between Gaza and the West Bank, there is a pressing need for data from institutions such as NNUH, which serve as central referral hubs. Understanding pediatric lymphoma in this context is essential for informing national treatment strategies, especially in the absence of centralized registries and standardized protocols across the territory.</p><p id="Par48">By providing much-needed data, this study contributes to the understanding and treatment of pediatric lymphoma in resource-limited settings.</p><p id="Par49">Our objectives were to study the clinical profile of pediatric lymphoma patients from 2013 to 2023 in terms of demographic data; to describe the clinical history of patients at presentation and admission; to review labs for initial admission, including complete blood count; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level; bone marrow (BM) biopsy; immunohistochemistry; and whole-body computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans and to study short term outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par50">A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted in 2023 at NNUH, a leading referral cancer center in the West Bank and Gaza, Palestine, to investigate the clinical profile and treatment outcomes of pediatric lymphoma patients treated from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2022.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population and sampling</title><p id="Par51">Patients were identified through electronic medical records at the Pediatric Oncology Department. All pediatric patients (&#8804;&#8201;18 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of HL or NHL who initiated treatment at NNUH between January 2013 and December 2022 were eligible for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they were diagnosed at NNUH but chose to begin treatment at another institution (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;9), had relapsed disease at the time of initial presentation (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;5), or had incomplete medical records (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;7). A total of 75 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par52">The collected data included demographic factors (age, sex, residence), clinical presentation (e.g., neck mass, B symptoms), lymphoma type and subtype (HL or NHL), tumor site (e.g., head/neck, mediastinal), staging (Ann Arbor for HL, St. Jude for NHL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>B symptoms, LDH levels (&lt;&#8201;320 or &#8805;&#8201;320 U/L)<sup>18</sup>, and CNS and BM involvement. First-line treatment protocols followed international pediatric oncology guidelines. For HL, patients were treated with ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) or OEPA/COPDAC-based regimens. NHL patients receive risk-adapted multiagent chemotherapy, such as BFM protocols, on the basis of the BL and LL classifications. Salvage therapy in relapsed patients included intensive reinduction with ICE (ifos, carboplatin, etoposide) or other high-risk regimens when clinically indicated.</p><p id="Par53">The selection of treatment regimens was guided by international pediatric oncology standards; however, their implementation was influenced by local drug availability. Some regimens, including salvage protocols such as ICE, are used on the basis of availability through the hospital formulary or support from humanitarian donations. Delays or substitutions occasionally occurred due to supply interruptions.</p><p id="Par54">The outcome measures included death, relapse, remission, overall survival (OAS), and event-free survival (EFS) rates. <italic toggle="yes">Relapse</italic> was defined as the recurrence of lymphoma after remission, which was identified by positron emission tomography (PET) or other diagnostic imaging, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or chest X-ray. <italic toggle="yes">Remission</italic> was defined as the absence of detectable disease activity on diagnostic imaging following treatment at the last recorded follow-up. Cures that require sustained remission over a prolonged period, typically five years or more, as suggested by the National Cancer Institute, or up to 10 years, as suggested by Cancer Research UK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>could not be evaluated because of the study&#8217;s limited follow-up duration (mean 26.5&#8201;&#177;&#8201;18 months). Given this timeframe, remission and EFS were used as primary outcomes, as they better reflect the short- to medium-term prognosis in pediatric lymphoma patients. Each patient&#8217;s OAS status was determined on the basis of their survival at the last hospital follow-up. EFS and OAS were estimated via Kaplan&#8210;Meier survival analysis. EFS was defined as the time from diagnosis to the first documented relapse or death from any cause, with patients who had not experienced an event at their last follow-up being censored. OAS was defined as the time from diagnosis to death from any cause, with patients who were alive at their last follow-up being censored. Survival probabilities were calculated at 2 years (24 months) on the basis of Kaplan&#8210;Meier estimates rather than direct event counts. Patients who were transferred to another institution were censored at their last known follow-up to ensure accurate survival estimates without overestimation of mortality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par55">The data were analysed via IBM SPSS v.29.0. Continuous variables are presented as the means&#8201;&#177;&#8201;standard deviations (SDs) or medians with interquartile ranges, whereas categorical variables are reported as frequencies and percentages. The chi-square test or Fisher&#8217;s exact test was used to analyse categorical variables. Descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted, with statistical significance set at <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05. Patients who were transferred to another hospital after completing their full treatment at our center were included in the analysis, as they met the inclusion criteria and were followed until transfer. Since their outcomes were known up to their last follow-up, they were handled as follows: In the EFS analysis, these patients were recorded as events if they experienced relapse before transfer. In the OS analysis, these patients were censored at the time of transfer in the Kaplan&#8210;Meier survival analysis, as they were still alive at the last follow-up, but their posttransfer survival was unknown. This approach ensures that survival time <bold>is</bold> accounted for without overestimating mortality. Supplementary analyses included unstratified survival comparisons across the full cohort (HL and NHL combined) to explore broader patterns. However, given the distinct biology and treatment of HL and NHL, all the main inferential analyses in the manuscript were performed separately by subtype.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="Par56">The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at An-Najah National University and the clinical research center at NNUH.

As shown in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, most NHL patients (31.7%) first presented with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as abdominal pain, masses, or signs of obstruction, whereas a majority of HL patients (70.6%) presented with neck masses. This difference in initial symptoms was statistically significant (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.003). These distinct patterns in symptom presentation highlight the differing anatomical predilections and progression behaviors of HL and NHL in our cohort. Notably, the high proportion of abdominal symptoms in NHL patients may reflect diagnostic delays, particularly among patients referred from Gaza. Other symptoms observed included respiratory issues such as chronic cough and rarer signs such as facial swelling or jaw pain. At the time of diagnosis, NHL was mostly found at stage III (41.5%), whereas HL was more often diagnosed at stage II (41.2%), with fewer cases presenting at stage IV, where the disease had spread to bones, the CNS, or other organs. As shown in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, subtype analysis revealed that BL (56.1%) was the most common subtype of NHL, whereas classical nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma (73.5%) was the most common subtype of HL, with these differences being statistically significant (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001).

</p><p id="Par66">The time to relapse ranged from 1 to 54 months, with a median of 8 months and a mean of 13 months. Among the patients who relapsed, 4 patients with HL achieved remission after retreatment, whereas none of the NHL patients achieved remission. Five patients (6.7%) remained in relapse after retreatment and were transferred for further care (1 HL, 4 NHL). This finding suggests a differential response to salvage regimens and may reflect more aggressive disease behavior in NHL patients. Since these patients experienced relapse before transfer, they were recorded as events in the EFS analysis. However, because they were still alive at their last follow-up, they were censored at the time of transfer in the OAS analysis via Kaplan&#8210;Meier survival curves. This ensures that their survival time contributed to the analysis without overestimating mortality.</p><p id="Par67">Deaths occurred in 3 patients (4.0%), all from the NHL group, including 2 patients who died without preceding relapse and 1 patient who died after relapse; thus, 96% of all patients survived. Overall, 67 patients (89.3%), including 33 HL patients and 34 NHL patients, achieved remission. Total events (relapse or death) were slightly more common in NHL patients (7 patients) than in HL patients (5 patients), and in total, 12 events (relapse or death) were recorded. During the follow-up period (mean 26.5&#8201;&#177;&#8201;18 months), 84% of the patients experienced events (a total of 12 events, including relapse or death), with 86.7% of patients remaining event free. The 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 85.1%, and the 2-year overall survival (OAS) rate was 96.6%, as estimated via Kaplan&#8210;Meier survival analysis, as shown in supplementary Figs.&#160;1 and 2. These favourable short-term outcomes indicate effective protocol-based treatment despite systemic challenges, but longer follow-up is needed to assess late relapse and cure. The chi-square test was used to examine associations between patient characteristics and treatment outcomes, and no significant correlations were found between demographic and clinical characteristics and survival or event rates, as shown in Supplementary Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 2.</p><p id="Par68">Additionally, Kaplan&#8210;Meier survival analysis was performed to compare EFS and OAS between HL patients and NHL patients.

A notable distinction in our cohort is the high proportion of patients from Gaza (44%), where access to care is often limited. In addition to geographic and political barriers, the Gaza Strip has endured repeated episodes of armed conflict over the past decade, which have significantly disrupted healthcare services. These conditions likely contribute to delays in diagnosis, treatment interruption, and loss to follow-up, ultimately affecting disease progression and outcomes for paediatric lymphoma patients in this region. Furthermore, fluctuations in chemotherapy drug availability and limited access to advanced imaging or pathology tools can restrict the use of guideline-recommended protocols. Additionally, neck masses, as predominant HL symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms for NHL, were more pronounced in our cohort than typically reported. These differences may reflect diagnostic delays and region-specific disease patterns. These challenges not only affect early detection and treatment completion but also limit the feasibility of standardized follow-up and national protocol implementation. Addressing these barriers is essential for improving long-term outcomes and establishing equity in pediatric cancer care across regions of Palestine.</p><p id="Par82">In terms of our outcomes, the survival of children and adolescents with cancer has clearly significantly increased over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

These findings diverge from those of prior studies, which often reported significant associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>which might be due to the small sample size of our study or the early transfer of advanced stages, which were excluded from the study.</p><p id="Par86">Two studies performed in East Asia and Spain reported that initial LDH levels were significantly associated with OAS and EFS and that higher LDH values were associated with poorer outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Therefore, OS and EFS were calculated as short-term outcomes and should not be interpreted as long-term survival indicators.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par88">The study&#8217;s limitations include the small sample size of 75 pediatric lymphoma patients, which may limit the ability to identify significant treatment changes or generalize findings. Although NNUH is a main referral center, some pediatric lymphoma cases in Gaza and the southern West Bank may have been treated at other institutions. Access to records from those centers was limited due to logistical and administrative barriers.</p><p id="Par89">Additionally, the retrospective design of this study, encompassing data collected from 2013&#8211;2023, introduces inherent constraints, including potential inconsistencies in data recording and variations in follow-up durations. Patient inclusion and follow-up periods varied due to factors such as treatment completion without subsequent follow-up or transfer to specialized facilities. Notably, some patients completed their prescribed treatment regimens but did not return for scheduled follow-up assessments, limiting the ability to monitor long-term outcomes and assess sustained remission or potential late relapses. Additionally, five patients transferred to other centers were alive at their last follow-up; however, their posttransfer outcomes remain unknown, limiting the comprehensiveness of our survival analysis. Moreover, logistical and geographic challenges, particularly for patients from the Gaza Strip, limit our ability to conduct the longer-term follow-up necessary to assess cure rates. The mean follow-up duration of 26.5&#8201;&#177;&#8201;18 months was insufficient to evaluate long-term outcomes definitively. The limited follow-up duration was largely due to logistical and political barriers that restrict long-term access to care, especially for patients from Gaza, who often cannot return for extended monitoring. Additionally, inconsistent outpatient surveillance, incomplete follow-up records, and the absence of a centralized cancer registry contributed to the constrained follow-up window. These systemic challenges limit our ability to assess long-term outcomes and cure rates. Determining &#8216;cure&#8217; in pediatric lymphoma patients typically requires a follow-up period of five years or more to monitor for late relapse and sustained remission. The relatively short follow-up in this study precludes the assessment of cure rates and may lead to the underestimation of late-occurring events.</p><p id="Par90">To mitigate these limitations, future research should consider prospective study designs with standardized data collection methods and extended follow-up periods. Such approaches would enable a more accurate assessment of long-term outcomes, including cure rates, and provide a clearer understanding of the factors influencing survival and remission in paediatric lymphoma patients.</p><p id="Par91">Our 10-year study of pediatric lymphoma patients at NNUH provided valuable insights into their demographics and clinical characteristics, highlighting the success of their treatment protocols. However, it also highlights the need for improved cancer registries and a nationwide association for patients to improve communication and care quality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par92">Our study provides insights into the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of pediatric lymphoma patients in Palestine. Pediatric lymphoma is more common in males and primarily affects children over 10 years of age. HL is less prevalent, has a higher survival rate, and most commonly presents with a neck mass. In contrast, NHL is more common, is associated with higher relapse and mortality rates, and often presents with gastrointestinal symptoms. Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma (BL) is the most common NHL subtype and is not strongly associated with B symptoms. These findings emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and continuous follow-up in optimizing treatment outcomes. However, owing to the small sample size and limited follow-up duration, long-term conclusions cannot be drawn. Further studies with larger cohorts and extended follow-up are needed to validate these findings and assess long-term survival and cure rates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
