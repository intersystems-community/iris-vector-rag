Physical therapists at these clinics provided their patients with a brochure summarizing the study procedures and asked for their permission to be contacted by the research team. After eligibility screening, participants gave their consent by telephone and signed the electronic consent form. One week prior to the intervention (time one; T1), participants completed the first questionnaire which contained sociodemographic and psychological measures. Participants then participated in the intervention (described below) individually or group format via <italic toggle="yes">Zoom</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">TEAMS</italic>.

Participants learn to identify distressing thoughts and practice cognitive restructuring. At the end of the course, participants receive a 20-minute guided relaxation audio file featuring binaural tones. In this study, the intervention was delivered by a licensed physical therapist and certified instructor of Empowered Relief using an electronic slide deck to patients in a single session lasting 120&#160;minutes.

Results indicated that at 4&#160;weeks post-treatment, pain catastrophizing scores were significantly reduced, however, significant reductions in perceived injustice were only observed among participants with subacute pain. Findings from multivariate analyses showed that pain stage and reductions in pain catastrophizing were significantly associated with decreases in perceived injustice, highlighting the potential benefit of early interventions that target pain catastrophizing in individuals with low back pain.</p><p>The results of this study demonstrated that pain stage and changes in pain catastrophizing predicted changes in perceived injustice at follow-up, while controlling for union status at work, ethnicity, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and pain intensity. This suggests that during the subacute phase, reductions in pain catastrophizing were strongly linked to improvements in how unjust the pain experience was perceived. It is important to consider that the observed reductions in pain catastrophizing and perceived injustice among participants in the subacute phase may reflect natural recovery processes or the effects of physical therapy.<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26&#8211;28</xref> However, it has been suggested that current rehabilitation approaches may have a limited impact on perceived injustice. For example, Sullivan et al reported a 5% decrease in perceived injustice in a sample of 70 work-disabled participants with subacute and chronic pain musculoskeletal pain who were enrolled in a rehabilitation program that consisted primarily of physical and occupational therapy interventions aimed at maximizing tolerance for work-related activities.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Scores on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale were significantly reduced at follow-up among participants in both pain stages. However, in individuals with chronic pain, scores on the Injustice Experience Questionnaire reduced by 16.8% but remained above the clinical cut-off of 19,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> indicating that perceived injustice persisted at clinically significant levels despite some improvement. It is possible that when individuals experience prolonged occupational pain, they are more likely to encounter multiple sources of injustice that fuel perceptions of injustice. In fact, disability reflects a complex interaction of numerous factors involving personal factors as well as workplace, healthcare, and legislative factors.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Scott et al reported that potential sources of injustice following painful injury include employers and/or colleagues, insurers, healthcare professionals, as well as personal factors such as family and friends.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> This underscores the importance of providing early interventions before workers encounter additional sources of injustice that can hinder their rehabilitation process.</p><p>The current study revealed a strong association (r = 0.723) between pain catastrophizing and perceived injustice in participants subacute and chronic low back pain. This finding aligns with prior correlational research, for example, Sullivan et al reported a similar correlation between pain catastrophizing and perceived injustice in a sample of 70 individuals with subacute and chronic pain following an occupational injury or a rear-end motor vehicle accident (r = 0.65 to 0.75).<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Rodero et al also reported a similar association between pain catastrophizing and perceived injustice in a sample of 250 participants with fibromyalgia (r = 0.65).<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Due to the correlational nature of these studies, it remains unclear whether pain catastrophizing influences perceived injustice, or how both are shaped by other factors such as coping strategies, social support, or external influences.</p><p>Previous studies have discussed the conceptual overlap between pain catastrophizing and perceived injustice. Specifically, it has been suggested that the &#8220;rumination&#8221; dimension of pain catastrophizing may overlap with the &#8220;severity/irreparability of loss&#8221; dimension of perceived injustice.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This study demonstrates that changes in the &#8220;rumination&#8221; subscale in pain catastrophizing contributed to changes in both dimensions of perceived injustice: &#8220;severity/irreparability of loss&#8221; and &#8220;externalized blame/unfairness&#8221;. This finding highlights the central role of rumination as a core mechanism through which individuals may become &#8220;stuck&#8221; after musculoskeletal injury. Indeed, it has been suggested that attentional difficulties may represent a common mechanism of action linking pain catastrophizing and perceived injustice.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It is possible that people who ruminate tend to have difficulty disengaging from their pain-related thoughts, which can impact perceptions of injustice. Just as catastrophizing reflects an exaggerated focus on pain, perceived injustice may reflect an exaggerated and persistent focus on loss&#8212;both of which are fueled by the inability to shift attention away from distressing pain-related thoughts.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The findings of this study have multiple implications. Clinically, these findings suggest that early psychological intervention targeting pain catastrophizing&#8212;particularly its rumination component&#8212;may be important for reducing perceptions of injustice in individuals with occupational low back pain. The findings also highlight that timing matters: since reductions in perceived injustice were observed primarily in those with subacute pain, implementing brief psychological interventions in combination with physical therapy during this stage may prevent the development of maladaptive pain-related thoughts that can hinder recovery. From a theoretical perspective, the results support discussions linking pain catastrophizing to perceived injustice through shared mechanisms such as rumination.&#160;Future research may expand on these findings to develop a conceptual model to better understand the development, maintenance and worsening of perceptions of injustice following injury.</p><p>This study had several limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting the findings. First, the absence of a control group prevented us from attributing changes in perceived injustice solely to the interventions (pain management skills course and physical therapy). Second, the recruitment was limited to participants with occupational low back pain, minimizing generalizability of the findings to the broader population or to individuals with other types of pain. Additionally, the small proportion of participants (33%) in the chronic pain stage might have limited the study&#8217;s ability to draw robust conclusions about this group. Furthermore, the sample lacked diversity, as 81% of the participants identified as white. Further research should aim to replicate these findings with a more diversified and balanced representation of participants across pain phases to developed more effective and tailored interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study highlights the value of early psychological intervention in the treatment of occupational low back pain, showing that changes in pain catastrophizing are associated with changes in perceived injustice during the subacute phase. The findings also offer insights into the shared mechanisms between pain catastrophizing and perceived injustice, highlighting the important role of rumination and potential difficulties with attentional disengagement following injury. The results support the development of stage-specific interventions that address pain-related psychological risk factors following low back pain.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s0006"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>IEQ, Injustice Experience Questionnaire; PCS, Pain Catastrophizing Scale; T1, time one; T2, time two; PROMIS, Patient-Reported Outcomes&#160;Measurement&#160;Information System; SD, standard deviation; IMMPACT, The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s0007"><title>Data Sharing Statement</title><p>The datasets used or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p></sec><sec id="s0008"><title>Ethics Approval</title><p>The primary project was approved by the <italic toggle="yes">Comit&#233; d&#8217;&#233;thique de la recherche &#8211; &#201;ducation et sciences sociales</italic> of the Universit&#233; de Sherbrooke (#2022-3392).
