Over time, its indications have evolved [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the United States, advances in treatment modalities have led to a decline in lower extremity amputations (LEAs, defined as transtibial or more proximal amputations) related to traumatic events and cancer; however, those associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) continue to rise [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

A single-center, observational, retrospective study was conducted at this hospital, analyzing the medical records of all patients who attended outpatient consultations for Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation - Amputees between January 2015 and June 2024. Patients were excluded if they were being followed for upper limb amputation, had a congenital disorder, or if their medical records lacked relevant information. Of an initial cohort of 768 patients, 38 were excluded according to these criteria, resulting in a final sample of 730 patients. The sample included all consecutive patients followed at this hospital during the study period, ensuring representativeness of the population under care. Observations with missing data or lost to follow-up were excluded from the analyses.</p><p>Demographic characteristics, comorbidities (DM, hypertension, PAD, and dyslipidemia), patient habits (alcohol use and smoking), and long-term mortality data were extracted from the medical records of outpatient consultations reviewed for the purposes of this study. Long-term mortality data were also confirmed through these records.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using R software (v. 4.4.1), with the packages readxl, dplyr, car, survival, and survminer. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the variables of interest. Independent samples t-tests were conducted to assess differences in age at death and time after amputation across binary comorbidity variables, with statistical significance set at p &lt; 0.05. For categorical variables, ANOVA was employed (p &lt; 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the association between comorbidities and mortality, with ORs and 95% CIs calculated to quantify the strength of associations. Variance inflation factors were computed for all variables (range: 1.09-1.70), indicating no evidence of problematic multicollinearity; therefore, no variables were excluded from the model.

More than two-thirds of the patients were male, reflecting the higher incidence of amputations among men, likely influenced by lifestyle factors such as smoking (42% in men vs. 12% in women). According to the National Institute of Statistics, 17.0% of the Portuguese population aged 15 years and older were smokers in 2019, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1 [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This predominance of men should be considered when generalizing our findings, as outcomes may differ in populations with a more balanced sex distribution.</p><p>Over the nine-year study period, 208 patients died, with five- and 15-year mortality rates of 20% and 26%, respectively. Most studies have reported a five-year mortality following LEA of 55% [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] to 70% [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], as supported by a 2017 meta-analysis [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, a recent study of more than 25,000 patients reported a much lower mortality of 18.1% [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This discrepancy may be explained by several factors: many earlier studies recruited cohorts in the early 2000s, when PAD was undertreated, particularly with regard to statin therapy. In addition, advances in wound care have likely helped prevent higher-level amputations [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The relatively low mortality observed in our cohort should be interpreted in the context of the exclusion of perioperative deaths, which would have increased overall mortality, as well as the benefits of the comprehensive, specialized care provided at our high-volume physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) center. At Hospital de Santo Ant&#243;nio, all patients undergoing amputation surgery are evaluated by a PMR physician before discharge, with follow-up consultations scheduled as part of routine care. The hospital&#8217;s Diabetic Foot Group meets weekly to assess hospitalized patients with neuropathic or neuroischemic diabetic foot ulcers and determine the most appropriate therapeutic strategies. Additionally, the hospital provides a specialized outpatient diabetic foot consultation, where patients are assessed for cutaneous and neurovascular integrity. Therapeutic interventions include callus debridement, ulcer treatment, and correction of nail abnormalities. Recent evidence also highlights the effectiveness of preventive strategies such as rocker-bottom shoes and orthotic insoles in redistributing plantar pressure and reducing complications in diabetic patients [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This approach is supported by an interdisciplinary team, including vascular and orthopedic surgeons, endocrinologists, podiatrists, and physical therapists, ensuring coordinated and holistic patient management.</p><p>Kaplan-Meier analysis (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) showed that amputations due to oncologic disease had the worst prognosis, with hip disarticulations, frequently associated with oncologic disease, consistently showing the poorest outcomes (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Vascular disease followed as the second leading etiology associated with the lowest survival outcomes and accounted for 64% of LEAs in our cohort, indicating its significant impact on mortality. Given the preventable nature of many cardiovascular diseases, adopting heart-healthy behaviors, such as a balanced diet, regular physical activity, smoking cessation, and effective risk factor management, could greatly reduce this burden [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Regarding risk factors for increased mortality, DM and hypertension were identified as statistically significant contributors. Interestingly, a diagnosis of dyslipidemia was found to be a protective factor. Robust evidence supports statin therapy as an effective intervention for reducing cardiovascular mortality risk [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A prospective study by DeCarlo et al., involving 811 patients who underwent major LEA, demonstrated that medium- and high-intensity statin therapy was associated with a survival benefit at one year [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We acknowledge that dyslipidemia is often linked to statin initiation, which raises the possibility of confounding bias: the observed protective association may reflect the effects of treatment rather than the diagnosis itself. Treatment data (e.g., prescription or adherence to statins) were not available, so this finding should be interpreted with caution. Hypertension, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption were also shown to influence the mean age at death, underscoring the importance of monitoring these risk factors in amputee patients during follow-up.</p><p>In line with existing literature, above-knee amputation (AKA) was associated with a slightly higher mortality rate than below-knee amputation, 31% and 28%, respectively. This difference is likely related to the greater functional limitations associated with AKA, which result in reduced mobility and, consequently, poorer cardiovascular health [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Another factor to consider is the potentially more advanced vascular disease at the time of amputation in AKA patients [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>This study has several limitations. Data were collected from post-discharge PMR consultations, which did not capture perioperative or short-term mortality. As some patients may not have survived long enough to attend these consultations, they were excluded. This selection bias may have led to an underestimation of overall mortality and could also have influenced the observed predictors of mortality, as patients with higher perioperative risk were not represented. Furthermore, because the study relied on medical records, some comorbidities may not have been fully documented, and certain potentially relevant conditions, such as ischemic heart disease, were not included. Finally, the study was conducted at a single medical center, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights the high long-term mortality associated with LEAs, although survival rates appear to be improving, likely due to advances in medical management and rehabilitation. Mortality was strongly influenced by comorbidities, with vascular disease being the leading cause of amputation and the second most significant factor associated with reduced survival. The observed protective effect of dyslipidemia may reflect the mortality benefit of statin therapy, as supported by previous literature. Future research directly assessing statin use in amputee populations would help clarify this association.</p><p>Our findings also suggest that specialized, interdisciplinary care, such as that provided at our high-volume PMR center, can contribute to improved outcomes. Structured follow-up with an interdisciplinary team, including vascular and orthopedic surgeons, endocrinologists, podiatrists, and physical therapists, may reduce complications, enhance functional recovery, and ultimately improve long-term survival. These results also reinforce the value of preventive strategies to reduce amputation rates, including effective management of cardiovascular risk factors, in mitigating long-term mortality. Despite its retrospective design and the exclusion of perioperative and short-term mortality, this study provides valuable insights into long-term survival after LEA.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Informed consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Animal subjects:</bold> All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve animal subjects or tissue.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#160; Maria Pires, Jo&#227;o Diniz , Ana Aguiar, Pedro Cantista, M&#225;rio Vaz</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#160; Maria Pires, Marta Estrela, Francisco Neves, Ana Fialho, Catarina Silva</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#160; Maria Pires, Jo&#227;o Diniz , Ana Aguiar, Marta Estrela, Pedro Cantista, M&#225;rio Vaz, Francisco Neves, Ana Fialho, Catarina Silva</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#160; Maria Pires, Jo&#227;o Diniz , Ana Aguiar, Pedro Cantista, M&#225;rio Vaz</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#160; Maria Pires</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>What happens to our amputees?
