</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Obesity and overweight represents a complex and significant health challenge in the United Kingdom (UK) for the government, healthcare providers and patients. In England, an estimated 64% of adults aged 18 or over were estimated to be overweight or living with obesity in 2023 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; this is projected to increase, reaching around 7 in 10 people by 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The disease is associated with a large clinical burden, particularly as patients with obesity are at an increased risk of many complications, including numerous respiratory (e.g. obstructive sleep apnoea [OSA]), cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and metabolic conditions as well as certain types of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Alongside the clinical burden, obesity is associated with substantial economic burden; in 2021, the National Health Service (NHS) spent an estimated &#163;19.2&#160;billion on overweight (&#163;7.9&#160;billion) and obesity (&#163;11.4&#160;billion). The total costs to the UK economy are estimated at &#163;97.9&#160;billion which is expected to increase to nearly &#163;109.4&#160;billion annually by 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Consequently, effective obesity treatment is essential for reducing patient morbidity and mortality, as well as for mitigating the significant economic impact of obesity.</p><p id="Par8">Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide&#160;1 (GLP-1) agonist, adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity (hereafter referred to diet and exercise [D&amp;E]) is licensed for the treatment of adult patients with a body mass index (BMI)&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;30&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obesity), or&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;27 to &lt;&#8201;30&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (overweight) with at least one weight-related comorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the UK, liraglutide 3&#160;mg as an adjunct to D&amp;E is currently reimbursed and recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as an option for managing overweight or obesity in a more restricted population: patients with a BMI&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;35&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (albeit a lower BMI threshold for certain ethnicities), non-diabetic hyperglycaemia or a fasting plasma glucose level of 5.5&#8211;6.9&#160;mmol/L, and a high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Liraglutide is recommended for use only within a specialist weight management service (SWMS) led by a specialist multidisciplinary team, which patients can access for up to 2&#160;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">More recently, tirzepatide, a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist, has shown substantial and sustained body weight reductions in patients receiving 5&#160;mg, 10&#160;mg or 15&#160;mg in the pivotal SURMOUNT-1 phase&#160;3 trial, conducted over 72&#160;weeks with a multicentre, randomised, double-blind design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In 2023, tirzepatide received approval by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for the treatment of weight management as an adjunct to D&amp;E in adults with an initial BMI of &#8805;&#8201;30&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obesity), or &#8805;&#8201;27 to &lt;&#8201;30&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (overweight) with at least one weight-related comorbid condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition to this, in 2024, tirzepatide was accepted by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) for use within NHS Scotland for weight management as an adjunct to D&amp;E in adults with a BMI&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;30&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and at least one weight-related health condition, with its use not limited to SWMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. More recently, NICE recommended the use of tirzepatide as an adjunct to D&amp;E for weight management in a subset of patients in the MHRA-approved population in adults with an initial BMI of &#8805;&#8201;35&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and at least one weight-related comorbidity, while also allowing lower BMI thresholds for certain ethnic groups and not restricting access to a SWMS setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">The primary objective of the current economic evaluation was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of tirzepatide compared to liraglutide (3&#160;mg), both adjunct to D&amp;E, in patients with a BMI&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;30&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obesity), or with a BMI &#8805;&#8201;27 to &lt;&#8201;30&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (overweight) with one or more obesity-related complication from a UK healthcare system perspective&#8212;hereafter referred to as the &#8216;trial population&#8217;. This population was aligned to the intention-to-treat trial population of the SURMOUNT-1 trial and the licensed population for both tirzepatide and liraglutide in weight management, with baseline

Firstly, patients may discontinue due to treatment failure (i.e. lack of response), defined as not achieving at least 5% weight loss 6&#160;months after titrating to the highest tolerated dose for tirzepatide, and not achieving at least 5% weight loss after 12&#160;weeks on the 3&#160;mg/day dose treatment for liraglutide, aligned to the MHRA summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for the respective treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Inputs for AE-related discontinuations were informed by the NMA and applied for a duration of 3&#160;years in the base case, after which no further AE-related discontinuation was assumed. Treatment discontinuation also occurred upon the receipt of bariatric surgery, with incidence of bariatric surgery based on the national incidence rate of 0.20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. An alternative scenario which does not apply discontinuation due to AEs was also conducted (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">Finally, for liraglutide, discontinuation could also occur due to the SWMS limit that caps the maximum duration for a given treatment (i.e. applying a stopping rule in the model) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the subgroup analyses, a 2-year stopping rule was applied to liraglutide to reflect the maximum treatment duration for SWMS that was modelled in the liraglutide NICE appraisal. For tirzepatide, no stopping rule was applied to align with its anticipated use in clinical practice (used both in primary and secondary care, and not restricted for use in SWMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">After discontinuing treatment, surrogate endpoints gradually reverted to a baseline level reflecting the expected level for patients who have received D&amp;E alone; this treatment waning was assumed to be at a linear rate over 3&#160;years from discontinuation. This method is consistent with other economic evaluations of obesity treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

This sex-specific weight increase was based on Ara et al., a systematic literature review evaluating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of pharmacological interventions in patients with obesity, and was applied up to age 68, as reported in the publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Beyond age 68, no further weight gain was assumed. A further scenario (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) uses data on BMI progression observed in a cohort of over 250,000 individuals in the UK captured over a median duration of 10.9&#160;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">In both treatment arms, it was assumed that patients experiencing prediabetes reversal would revert to prediabetes by the end of the treatment effect waning period (3&#160;years in the base case) following treatment discontinuation. An alternative scenario was conducted that tested the impact of a different assumed waning period of efficacy following treatment discontinuation (2&#160;years; Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), with minimal impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for all three doses of tirzepatide.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Other Inputs</title><p id="Par26">Only severe gastrointestinal (GI) events were included in the analysis as an adverse event (AE). This decision was based on findings from the SURMOUNT-1 trial, which indicated that no single severe AE of grade 3 or 4 would meet the common inclusion criteria (&#8805;&#8201;2% or 5% respectively in any treatment arm). As such, GI events were grouped together, as these were the most relevant for inclusion and were estimated to incur both a treatment cost and patient disutility impact (see Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref> in the supplementary materials).</p><p id="Par27">Mortality was modelled by categorising a patient&#8217;s death as either cardiovascular (CV) event related, or non-CV. CV-related deaths are a potential complication of obesity or overweight and can be compared between tirzepatide and liraglutide. For non-CV death, general population mortality was adjusted by excluding the mortality of obesity-related complications accounted for elsewhere in the model (e.g. fatal CV events and T2DM) and was BMI-specific given the independent association between BMI and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

These were sourced from published national cost data, inflated to the latest available cost year using the NHS cost inflation index where relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

Patients who experienced acute events, such as a stroke, incurred a one-off utility decrement applied in the same model cycle as the event incidence. Utilities were combined using an additive approach, where utility decrements for each health complication or adverse event are summed; a scenario analysis was conducted to explore the use of a multiplicative approach,&#160;which reflects utility decrements as a fraction of one and multiplies them. This method considers that multiple conditions may have a compounded effect on quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Analyses</title><p id="Par30">A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted for tirzepatide versus liraglutide in both the SURMOUNT-1 trial population (trial population: BMI&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;30&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or BMI&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;27 to &lt;&#8201;30&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup>&#8201;+&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1 obesity-related complication) and in liraglutide&#8217;s NICE reimbursed population (subgroup population: patients with BMI&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;35&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup>&#8201;+&#8201;prediabetes&#8201;+&#8201;high risk of CVD).

trial population. Across all scenarios, the NHBs remained positive, indicating robust results regardless of changes in model assumptions, literature sources, or parameters (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Similar results were seen in the scenario analyses in the subgroup population (see Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> in the supplementary materials).</p><p id="Par35">Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> presents the incidence of key health outcomes in both the trial and subgroup populations. Overall, tirzepatide showed a reduction in at least five of seven clinical events and complications across 5&#160;mg, 10&#160;mg and 15&#160;mg doses compared to liraglutide, most notably for knee replacements (29&#8211;46% reduction) and T2DM (25&#8211;48% reduction). This is likely driven by comparative efficacy on key risk factors including weight loss (15&#8211;22% vs. 8%) and prediabetes reversal (93&#8211;94% vs. 88%) for the respective tirzepatide doses versus liraglutide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. While most complications saw reductions with tirzepatide, stroke and angina showed smaller differences between treatments. This is primarily due to the underlying risk equations used in the model, such as QRisk3, which are less sensitive to BMI changes and may therefore underestimate the impact of weight loss on these outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].<fig id="Fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;4</label><caption><p>Incidence of clinical events in the <bold>a</bold> trial population and <bold>b</bold> subgroup population (tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15&#160;mg vs. liraglutide).

However, none of the parameter ranges for these factors caused the ICER to exceed the UK WTP threshold (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

The subgroup analysis within liraglutide&#8217;s NICE reimbursed population was also relevant in this economic evaluation, as liraglutide 3&#160;mg is currently available and reimbursed in the UK in this population. This comparative analysis provides insights into tirzepatide&#8217;s potential advantages or limitations in real-world settings so stakeholders can make informed decisions about its potential adoption into the UK healthcare system.</p><p id="Par38">A key strength of the economic model is that the use of an IPS over a standard Markov cohort model allows for patient-level heterogeneity, such that individual patient history can be tracked to perform patient-level analysis. Secondly, the model outputs have been tested using various scenario analyses to explore the robustness of cost-effectiveness under alternative inputs and assumptions (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par39">The robustness of the model is further supported by having undergone validation with a UK clinical expert to thoroughly examine the clinical face validity of the methods, assumptions, risk equations, and results. Finally, model comparative efficacy inputs were informed by an NMA using an anchored comparison that accounts for between-trial differences in prognostic factors and is therefore robust.</p><p id="Par40">There are also limitations with the model. Notably, the model only includes a subset of clinical events and complications that a patient with overweight or obesity may experience. Despite the existence of numerous other obesity-related complications (including, but not limited to, polycystic ovary syndrome, infertility, asthma and COVID), the model only considers the most clinically and economically relevant complications: prediabetes, T2DM, CVD (angina, stroke and MI), MAFLD, OSA, knee osteoarthritis and bariatric surgery. These complications were selected based on their clinically significant impact on important outcomes including costs, patient quality of life and/or mortality. Although not all possible complications are captured in the model, the selected complications were clinically validated by an expert clinician and also aligned to other existing economic models relevant to this indication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">The risk equations used by the model also represent a source of analysis uncertainty. The risk equations were robustly identified through an economic systematic literature review as well as a review of risk equations used in the NICE submission for liraglutide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, these risk equations are all at least 5&#160;years old; in particular, all risk equations developed using data from the Framingham studies are several decades old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Hence, the calculated risk levels might not be reflective of the risk for patients receiving current clinical standard of care. Some of the risk equations selected were also not developed using UK patient cohorts, and therefore may not properly reflect risk for patients in the UK. However, these risk equations underwent a thorough validation process conducted by an independent expert clinician.</p><p id="Par42">Finally, the model does not consider any confidential discount to the liraglutide list price, possibly leading to an overestimation of the treatment cost for liraglutide. Comprehensive data and expert-validated assumptions were used to confirm that the overall conclusion of the analysis is accurate, excepting the ability to include confidential discounts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par43">The model indicates that, with low uncertainty, all three doses of tirzepatide (adjunct to D&amp;E) can be considered a cost-effective treatment versus liraglutide (adjunct to D&amp;E) at a UK WTP threshold in both the SURMOUNT-1 trial population (patients with BMI&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;30&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or BMI&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;27 to &lt;&#8201;30&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup>&#8201;+&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1 obesity-related complication) and liraglutide&#8217;s NICE reimbursed population (patients with BMI&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;35&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup>&#8201;+&#8201;prediabetes&#8201;+&#8201;high risk of CVD). At time of writing, this is the first published cost-effectiveness analysis of tirzepatide (5, 10 and 15&#160;mg) compared to liraglutide 3&#160;mg in these populations from a UK perspective.</p><p id="Par44">The model&#8217;s validity and robustness are supported by the scenario and sensitivity analyses presented. The analysis therefore supports the cost-effectiveness of introducing tirzepatide to the UK, potentially leading to cost savings and enhanced patient care on a broader scale in both primary and secondary care settings, compared to liraglutide, which is restricted for use within SWMS. NICE recently recommended tirzepatide in December 2024 for weight management, as an adjunct to D&amp;E in adults with an initial BMI of &#8805;&#8201;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and at least one weight-related comorbidity, a subset of the MHRA-approved population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Expanding the NICE recommendation to a broader range of patients could further reduce the economic burden of obesity and its related conditions, whilst also reducing the NHS implementation period from 12&#160;years to a much shorter timeframe, ensuring that the healthcare system and patients benefit from this technology. The broad reimbursement and faster implementation for tirzepatide could improve access, health outcomes, and reduce long-term healthcare costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="12325_2025_3288_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (PDF 340 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Prior Presentation:</bold> The poster titled &#8220;Cost-effectiveness of tirzepatide versus liraglutide (both adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity) in patients with obesity or overweight from a UK perspective&#8221; was presented at ISPOR EU 2024 (November 17&#8211;20; Barcelona, Spain).</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge Josephine Grist, BSc, from Costello Medical Consulting, London, UK for medical writing and editorial assistance in preparing this manuscript for publication based on the authors&#8217; input and direction.
