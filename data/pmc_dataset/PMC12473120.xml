GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), primarily used for diabetes management, have demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties beyond glucose regulation. This study explores the protective effect of semaglutide, a GLP-1RA, in reducing oxidative stress and promoting wound healing in human dermal fibroblasts.

Cell viability and ATP levels were measured via MTT and ATP assays. Apoptosis was evaluated using propidium iodide staining. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide were assessed through confocal microscopy with specific fluorescent probes. Wound healing was tested using scratch assays, with closure monitored over time and quantified with ImageJ (version 1.51). Gene expression levels of antioxidants, extracellular matrix components, inflammatory cytokines, and MMPs (MMP3, MMP9) were determined via real-time PCR. <bold>Results:</bold> Semaglutide significantly improved cell viability and ATP production under oxidative stress (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), while reducing apoptosis and intracellular ROS levels. It notably accelerated fibroblast wound closure, achieving near-complete restoration. Gene analysis revealed increased expression of antioxidant and ECM-related genes, along with decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines and MMPs, indicating reduced inflammation and enhanced tissue remodeling. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Semaglutide offers robust antioxidative and cytoprotective effects in dermal fibroblasts and retinal endothelial cells, promoting wound healing.

Introduction</title><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone predominantly involved in glucose regulation, exerting its effects by stimulating insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon release [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The therapeutic potential of GLP-1 has driven the development of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), which emulate its physiological effects [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These pharmacological agents have been shown to be effective in the management of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, by improving glycemic control, inducing weight loss, and decreasing cardiovascular risk factors [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Clinical trial data consistently demonstrate their efficacy, including significant reductions in adiposity and enhancements in the metabolic rate among patients with obesity [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>T2D is often complicated by chronic renal disease, neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy (DR), and cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Oxidative stress plays a key role in the development of these complications by damaging molecules and triggering pathways such as apoptosis, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Excess free radicals increase inflammatory mediators (e.g., transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF-&#946;) and tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;) and promote cell death through mechanisms involving p53 and caspases, leading to tissue damage [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Oxidative stress directly damages lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, impairing cellular functions and lipid homeostasis, thereby exacerbating cardiovascular complications [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Managing oxidative stress could therefore be vital in preventing or reducing diabetic complications [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have illuminated additional roles of GLP-1 in various physiological processes, notably its potential influence on oxidative stress and tissue repair mechanisms [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Oxidative stress, an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant defenses, is a critical factor that hampers effective wound healing [<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Elevated levels of oxidative stress can cause cellular damage, promote inflammation, and delay tissue regeneration, particularly in individuals with metabolic disorders such as T2D [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, increased oxidative stress accelerates the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are produced through the non-enzymatic glycation of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The accumulation of AGEs in tissues exacerbates oxidative damage and disrupts normal tissue repair processes. This cascade not only impairs wound healing but also contributes to the progression of diabetic complications. Together, the interplay among oxidative stress, AGEs, and impaired tissue regeneration creates a detrimental cycle that hinders recovery and perpetuates tissue dysfunction in metabolic disease states [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Emerging research suggests that GLP-1 may exert antioxidative effects by reducing ROS levels, enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity, and modulating inflammatory responses [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Concurrently, studies have indicated that GLP-1 can influence critical aspects of wound healing, such as promoting angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and extracellular matrix formation. Understanding the molecular pathways through which GLP-1 impacts oxidative stress and wound repair can open new avenues for therapeutic intervention, particularly in populations with impaired healing capacity [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In the SUSTAIN 6 trial, a two-year, pre-approval cardiovascular outcomes study, semaglutide was associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of DR complications relative to the placebo [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Nonetheless, this association was not corroborated by findings from other concurrent studies [<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to examine whether semaglutide has cytoprotective effects against oxidative stress in human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs). Specifically, the study aimed to assess the effect of semaglutide on key aspects of wound healing in fibroblasts, including cell migration and the expression profiles of extracellular matrix-associated genes. Additionally, the research sought to determine whether semaglutide enhances cellular viability, attenuates apoptosis, and mitigates oxidative damage in response to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, the study examined whether semaglutide exerts direct protective effects on retinal endothelial cells, thereby suggesting a broader potential therapeutic role in DR that extends beyond its established glycemic regulation. These findings aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of semaglutide&#8217;s cellular mechanisms and its prospective application in vascular and tissue repair within diabetic retinal pathology.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceutics-17-01115"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates the significant protective and regenerative effects of semaglutide on NHDFs and HRECs subjected to oxidative stress, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for conditions characterized by impaired wound healing, such as T2D. In the SUSTAIN 6 trial, a two-year cardiovascular outcomes study, semaglutide was linked to a significant increase in DR risk compared to the placebo [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Analyses suggest this may be mainly due to rapid and large reductions in HbA1c within the first 16 weeks, especially in patients with pre-existing DR, poor baseline control, and on insulin [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This early DR worsening is similar to what is seen with insulin therapy, linked to swift blood sugar improvements [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Current guidelines recommend close monitoring during insulin changes, and similar precautions should apply when using semaglutide to reduce DR progression risk [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Treatment with semaglutide markedly improves cellular viability and effectively reduces necrosis and apoptosis. As illustrated in <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figures S1 and S2</xref>, semaglutide has a minimal impact on normal cells not subjected to oxidative stress. Additionally, cellular proliferation is stimulated, contributing to tissue regeneration. Semaglutide administration reduces intracellular ROS, leading to decreased levels of mitochondrial superoxide and overall oxidative stress within cells. This effect supports the preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential and function, which are essential for energy production and cellular survival. The suppression of ROS generation leads to diminished oxidative damage to cellular components, including lipids, proteins, and DNA, and consequently reduces cell death and dysfunction [<xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Taken together, the data demonstrate that semaglutide exhibits a strong antioxidant effect while showing no evidence of carcinogenic potential.</p><p>Concurrently, upregulation of the expression of endogenous antioxidant defense genes, namely SOD1, CAT, GPX1, and GPX4, is observed following semaglutide administration. This enhancement of the antioxidant response indicates that the capacity for ROS neutralization is boosted, which further mitigates oxidative stress. The increased activity of these enzymes is critical for maintaining redox homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative insults.</p><p>In addition to the antioxidative effects, the clearest evidence of modulation within glycation pathways is provided by the significant decrease in levels of AGEs and RAGE expression. These modifications are known to promote oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue damage, and their reduction strongly suggests that semaglutide interrupts the vicious cycle of glycation and oxidative injury, which is particularly pertinent in diabetic tissues [<xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Consequently, the accumulation of AGEs is minimized, tissue elasticity and function are preserved, and the progression of diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications is potentially mitigated [<xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>A previous study using the db/db mouse model evaluated the impact of topical semaglutide on retinal inflammation and microvascular damage, in response to concerns regarding its direct effects on the retina [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Over a period of 15 days, eye drops containing semaglutide or vehicle were administered. It was found that glial activation, the expression of inflammatory cytokines, NF-&#954;B levels, and ICAM-1 were significantly reduced by semaglutide. Retinal ganglion cell apoptosis was prevented, and activation of the AKT pathway was observed. A substantial decrease in vascular leakage was also noted. These effects were seen without any change in blood glucose levels, indicating that they can be attributed directly to semaglutide [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The anti-inflammatory potential of semaglutide is supported by the observed downregulation of key cytokines such as IL1B and IL2. Chronic inflammation is recognized as a detrimental factor that prolongs the inflammatory phase of wound healing, delays tissue regeneration, and leads to tissue breakdown [<xref rid="B37-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The suppression of these cytokines indicates that semaglutide may effectively reduce inflammatory signaling, thereby facilitating progression to subsequent healing phases [<xref rid="B38-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Gene expression analyses further reveal that the treatment results in the upregulation of critical growth factors involved in tissue repair, such as EGF and FGF. These factors stimulate fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and re-epithelialization. Significantly, the expression levels of various ECM components including collagen types I, III, IV, and VI (COL1A1, COL3A1, COL4A1, COL6A1) are increased, indicating enhanced matrix deposition and stabilization, which are crucial for wound strength and integrity. Conversely, the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases MMP3 and MMP9 are decreased, reducing excessive ECM degradation and supporting proper tissue remodeling.</p><p>The healing process of diabetic wounds is hindered by the decreased proliferation and migration of epidermal and endothelial cells [<xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A semaglutide-loaded nanofiber membrane was developed to promote diabetic wound healing by suppressing ROS production and accelerating angiogenesis, using a diabetic rat model. The membrane was prepared through an electrostatic spinning technique, consisting of a thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer, a polyvinyl butyral ester, zein, and semaglutide. It was characterized by a uniform diameter, appropriate water vapor transmission rate, and effective water absorption and retention properties. In vivo, it was observed that the nanofiber membrane loaded with semaglutide facilitated the formation of a normal skin tissue structure during regeneration. In vitro, it was shown that semaglutide might help mitigate high-glucose-induced endothelial cell dysfunction by inhibiting ROS production. The study thus provided a theoretical foundation for the potential application of semaglutide in the treatment of diabetic ulcers and other wounds [<xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>The functional relevance of these molecular changes is demonstrated by the wound-healing assay, where the rate of wound closure is significantly accelerated by semaglutide treatment. The rapid migration and proliferation of fibroblasts, along with ECM deposition, contribute to the prompt closure of wounds, emphasizing semaglutide&#8217;s potential benefits for improving healing outcomes, especially in chronic wound environments typical of patients with T2D [<xref rid="B40-pharmaceutics-17-01115" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, GLP-1 receptor activation enhances cellular antioxidative defenses by increasing the expression of enzymes such as SOD1, CAT, GPX1, and GPX4, thereby reducing the accumulation of ROS. This activation also leads to a reduction in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1&#946; and IL-6. Additionally, the activation of FGF and EGF signaling pathways promotes ECM synthesis, supporting tissue repair and remodeling.</p><p>Importantly, these mechanisms are further supported by the modulation of pathways involved in the formation and accumulation of AGEs, which are known to exacerbate oxidative stress and inflammation in chronic conditions. By reducing AGE formation and oxidative stresses, semaglutide may attenuate the deleterious cellular effects associated with glycation and oxidative damage, thereby promoting regenerative processes and cellular resilience.</p><p>This study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into the effects of semaglutide on human fibroblasts and retinal endothelial cells, emphasizing its potential novel role in promoting cellular protection and tissue regeneration.</p><p>Future research should focus on optimizing dosing to enhance efficacy and reduce side effects during long-term use. Long-term safety studies are essential, especially for chronic conditions like T2D. In vivo studies using animal models that mimic human diabetic wounds are vital to understand semaglutide&#8217;s pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics within complex systems. Exploring combination therapies, such as with bioengineered scaffolds or growth factors, may improve healing outcomes, particularly in difficult wounds. Additional research should also investigate semaglutide&#8217;s potential in other chronic diseases involving oxidative stress, like cardiovascular conditions and neurodegeneration. Mechanistic studies are needed to clarify the signaling pathways involved, which could guide targeted therapies and biomarker development. For clinical translation, early trials should assess safety, dosing, and initial efficacy in patients with diabetic or chronic wounds to determine its practical use and suitable patient populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-pharmaceutics-17-01115"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Semaglutide demonstrates potent antioxidant effects in human dermal fibroblasts and retinal endothelial cells by reducing oxidative stress, improving cell viability, and decreasing apoptosis. Its ability to upregulate endogenous antioxidant genes and downregulate pro-inflammatory mediators further supports its protective role against oxidative damage. Additionally, semaglutide accelerates wound closure by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix remodeling, which are critical processes in tissue regeneration. These combined properties of semaglutide highlight its potential as a promising therapeutic agent for the management of diabetic foot ulcers, where impaired healing is often driven by oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as for addressing other oxidative stress-related complications in people with diabetes like DR. Further in vivo research is needed to investigate the potential effect of semaglutide for the prevention and treatment of diabetes-related complications.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
