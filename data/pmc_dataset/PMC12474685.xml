Affecting approximately 1&#8211;5% of children globally, its peak incidence aligns with the early childhood years, often driven by adenotonsillar hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While adenotonsillectomy has long served as the standard of care for moderate to severe cases, a considerable proportion of children&#8212;particularly those with mild or structurally non-dominant disease phenotypes&#8212;are managed medically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]reflecting a paradigm shift toward more conservative therapeutic strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Intranasal corticosteroids have emerged as a commonly prescribed first-line option for children with mild-to-moderate OSA, predicated on their capacity to reduce mucosal inflammation and improve upper airway patency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, therapeutic outcomes remain heterogeneous. Some patients demonstrate marked clinical and polysomnographic (PSG) improvement, whereas others exhibit minimal benefit, prompting concerns about both over- and under-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The absence of robust, individualized predictors of treatment response has hampered efforts to optimize patient selection, prolonging ineffective medical therapy in non-responders or deferring surgical intervention when earlier action may be warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This clinical uncertainty underscores an urgent need for precision tools to support evidence-based decision-making in this population.</p><p id="Par7">Despite the widespread use of polysomnography (PSG) for diagnostic classification, its application in therapeutic prognostication has been limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The apnea&#8211;hypopnea index (AHI) remains the principal metric for gauging OSA severity, yet it fails to capture the full spectrum of disease pathophysiology or predict downstream treatment outcomes reliably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Ancillary PSG parameters&#8212;such as the oxygen desaturation index (ODI), nadir oxygen saturation, arousal burden, and the distribution of respiratory events across sleep stages&#8212;offer a more nuanced portrait of disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, these variables have yet to be systematically interrogated for their prognostic value in the context of pharmacologic therapy. Moreover, existing evidence is largely derived from controlled trial settings with strict eligibility criteria, thereby limiting external validity and real-world applicability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Prediction modeling and risk stratification tools hold promise in addressing these gaps. By leveraging multivariate inputs&#8212;both clinical and physiological&#8212;nomograms can synthesize complex data into interpretable formats for use at the bedside. Such tools have been successfully applied in adult OSA and post-surgical pediatric cohorts but remain conspicuously absent in the realm of non-surgical pediatric OSA management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, most prior models have lacked rigorous external validation, a prerequisite for clinical adoption.</p><p id="Par9">Against this backdrop, we undertook a two-phase, observational study integrating both retrospective and prospective cohorts of children with mild-to-moderate OSA managed exclusively with intranasal corticosteroids. Utilizing high-resolution PSG data and standardized clinical assessments, we sought to identify baseline predictors of treatment responsiveness, construct a multivariable logistic model, and translate this into a user-friendly nomogram. Crucially, we subjected the model to independent validation in a temporally distinct cohort, enhancing the generalizability of our findings. By aligning methodological rigor with real-world clinical practice, our study aims to provide a practical, evidence-based framework for individualized therapy planning in pediatric OSA, potentially transforming the management algorithm for this heterogeneous and often undertreated population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par10">This investigation was designed as a single-center, two-phase observational study conducted at Affiliated Dongguan Maternal &amp; Child Healthcare Hospital; a tertiary teaching hospital located in eastern China. The study integrated a retrospective model development cohort and a prospectively assembled validation cohort to assess the prognostic utility of PSG parameters in predicting pharmacologic treatment response in pediatric patients with mild-to-moderate OSA. The derivation cohort included consecutive children diagnosed with OSA between January 2019 and December 2023, identified through the institutional clinical data repository. All patients underwent standardized overnight PSG testing and received uniform intranasal corticosteroid therapy. The external validation cohort comprised children newly diagnosed between January 2024 and May 2025, enrolled prospectively using identical diagnostic and treatment protocols.</p><p id="Par11">The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee of Affiliated Dongguan Maternal &amp; Child Healthcare Hospital (approval number: DCH202401008). Given the retrospective nature of the derivation cohort, the requirement for informed consent was formally waived. Informed consent was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of all prospectively enrolled children in the validation cohort. The study adhered to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and complied with relevant national regulations governing research involving human participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participant enrollment and eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par12">Participants were recruited in two temporally distinct phases. The derivation cohort included children diagnosed with OSA between January 2019 and December 2023, identified retrospectively from the sleep medicine database at Affiliated Dongguan Maternal &amp; Child Healthcare Hospital. The validation cohort consisted of prospectively enrolled patients who presented between January 2024 and May 2025. Eligibility criteria and outcome assessments were applied uniformly across both cohorts.</p><p id="Par13">Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age between 3 and 12 years at the time of initial diagnosis; (2) confirmed diagnosis of mild-to-moderate OSA, defined by an AHI between 1.0 and 10.0 events/hour on overnight polysomnography; (3) completion of a minimum 4-week course of intranasal corticosteroid therapy as first-line treatment; and (4) availability of both baseline and follow-up PSG data with at least 6 months of clinical follow-up.</p><p id="Par14">Exclusion criteria included: (1) prior surgical intervention for OSA, including adenotonsillectomy; (2) ongoing use of non-pharmacologic therapies such as CPAP or mandibular advancement devices; (3) comorbid neurological, genetic, or syndromic conditions that may influence sleep architecture or treatment response (e.g., Down syndrome, cerebral palsy); (4) incomplete or low-quality PSG recordings; or (5) loss to follow-up before response assessment. Children who received combined medical and surgical therapy within the follow-up period were also excluded. Patients meeting the above criteria were screened independently by two pediatric sleep specialists. Disagreements in classification were resolved by consensus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Baseline assessment and risk stratification</title><p id="Par15">All participants underwent full-night, technician-attended polysomnography (PSG) in the pediatric sleep laboratory of XX Hospital prior to initiation of treatment. PSG was performed using standardized protocols in accordance with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) pediatric scoring guidelines (Version 2.6). Signals recorded included electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography, electromyography, electrocardiography, airflow (nasal pressure transducer and thermistor), thoracoabdominal movement, snoring, and pulse oximetry. All recordings were reviewed and manually scored by two certified sleep technologists blinded to treatment outcomes. The AHI, defined as the average number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep, was used as the primary metric for OSA severity classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Mild and moderate OSA were defined by AHI thresholds of 1.0&#8211;5.0 and 5.1&#8211;10.0 events/hour, respectively. Additional PSG parameters recorded at baseline included ODI (events/hour), minimum oxygen saturation (SpO&#8322;, %), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (%), arousal index (events/hour), and the proportion of respiratory events occurring during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (% of total respiratory events). Body position during PSG was recorded and analyzed in accordance with standard AASM scoring guidelines. Positional AHI data were extracted where available, and patients were categorized as positional or non-positional OSA based on established criteria.</p><p id="Par16">Baseline demographic and clinical variables&#8212;including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), history of allergic rhinitis or asthma, and presence of adenotonsillar hypertrophy&#8212;were obtained from electronic medical records at the time of diagnosis. These clinical and PSG-derived variables were evaluated as potential predictors of treatment response and were included in subsequent univariate and multivariable analyses. Risk stratification was operationalized based on a binary classification system. Patients were categorized as &#8220;responders&#8221; if they met both of the following criteria at follow-up: (1)&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;50% reduction in AHI from baseline and (2) improvement in clinical symptoms as documented in follow-up visit notes. Those not meeting both criteria were classified as &#8220;non-responders.&#8221; This composite endpoint was chosen to reflect both objective physiological improvement and subjective symptomatic relief.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Treatment protocol</title><p id="Par17">All included patients received standardized pharmacologic therapy consisting of intranasal corticosteroids as first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate pediatric OSA. The therapeutic regimen was initiated within one week of PSG-based diagnosis and prescribed by pediatric otolaryngologists or respiratory physicians following institutional guidelines. The primary agent used was mometasone furoate nasal spray (50&#160;&#181;g per spray), administered at a dosage of one spray per nostril once daily (total daily dose: 100&#160;&#181;g), typically in the evening. In cases of documented corticosteroid intolerance or prior use, fluticasone propionate (100&#160;&#181;g/day) was used as an alternative.</p><p id="Par18">All patients received the medication for a minimum of 4 consecutive weeks, and most continued therapy for 6 to 8 weeks depending on clinical response and physician judgment. Treatment adherence was assessed during follow-up visits through caregiver interviews and inspection of remaining medication volume. Adherence was categorized as &#8220;high&#8221; if more than 80% of prescribed doses were administered, and &#8220;partial&#8221; if 50&#8211;80% of doses were used, based on caregiver recall and estimated volume remaining. No patients in either cohort received adjunctive therapy such as leukotriene receptor antagonists or nasal decongestants during the treatment period. Surgical intervention, including adenotonsillectomy, was not permitted prior to outcome assessment. The pharmacologic protocol was applied uniformly across both the derivation and validation cohorts to ensure comparability. Caregivers were provided with standardized instructions regarding medication administration and symptom monitoring. No dose adjustments or alternative regimens were implemented during the study window. Post-treatment PSG and clinical evaluation were scheduled at least 6 months after therapy initiation to allow sufficient time for physiological response and stabilization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Follow-up and outcome assessment</title><p id="Par19">All patients were followed for a minimum duration of 6 months after initiation of pharmacologic therapy, with a scheduled clinical reassessment and repeat overnight PSG conducted between months 6 and 9.

Follow-up evaluations were conducted in the same pediatric sleep laboratory using identical equipment and scoring protocols as at baseline. Clinical symptoms were assessed during outpatient visits by attending pediatricians using structured caregiver interviews and documented using standardized symptom templates.</p><p id="Par20">The primary treatment outcome was defined as a binary response classification. A &#8220;responder&#8221; was defined as a patient who demonstrated both (1)&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;50% reduction in AHI from baseline and (2) documented clinical improvement in snoring, mouth breathing, or restless sleep symptoms, as judged by physician review of caregiver reports. Structured caregiver interviews were conducted during follow-up visits, and responses were documented using a standardized symptom template in the electronic medical record. Although validated instruments such as the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire were not used, this method reflects consistent clinical practice and has been supported in prior studies assessing pediatric OSA treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">A &#8220;non-responder&#8221; was defined as a patient who failed to meet one or both of these criteria. This dual-criterion definition was chosen to reflect both objective physiological change and subjective symptom resolution.Key secondary outcomes included changes in PSG-derived parameters: AHI, ODI, minimum oxygen saturation (SpO&#8322;), arousal index, and REM-related respiratory event proportion. For each patient, absolute and relative differences between baseline and follow-up values were calculated. Follow-up PSGs were manually scored by blinded sleep technologists to minimize interpretive bias. Patients who underwent surgery, initiated other pharmacologic agents, or were lost to follow-up before repeat PSG were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par22">All statistical analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.3.2) with the rms, pROC, and ggplot2 packages. Continuous variables were presented as means with standard deviations (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD), and categorical variables as absolute numbers with corresponding percentages. Between-group comparisons were performed using independent-sample t-tests for continuous variables and &#967;&#178; or Fisher&#8217;s exact tests for categorical variables, as appropriate. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p id="Par23">To identify candidate predictors of treatment response, a set of baseline clinical and PSG parameters were first evaluated using univariate comparisons.

Through this effort, we constructed and externally validated a clinically deployable nomogram. Our analysis revealed that specific baseline characteristics&#8212;namely, elevated AHI, higher ODI, lower minimum oxygen saturation (SpO&#8322;), increased proportion of respiratory events occurring during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and advancing age&#8212;were independently associated with diminished likelihood of treatment success. These variables collectively informed a predictive model with strong discriminatory capacity and calibration fidelity, maintaining robust performance upon external validation. This suggests potential for practical integration in clinical decision-making within pediatric sleep medicine.</p><p id="Par36">In China, the estimated prevalence of pediatric OSA ranges from 3 to 5%, with higher rates reported in urban populations and among children with allergic rhinitis or obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, predictive modeling for treatment response remains scarce in the Chinese pediatric population, highlighting the need for localized data such as ours.</p><p id="Par37">Pharmacologic management of pediatric OSA, particularly using intranasal corticosteroids, has been addressed in prior studies predominantly through single-arm trials or small observational cohorts, often emphasizing symptom mitigation or modest changes in AHI as the primary endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, the empirical nature of patient selection has limited therapeutic precision. Our study addresses this clinical shortfall by systematically identifying response predictors using objective PSG-derived indices within a well-defined and consistently managed cohort. By incorporating both quantitative PSG metrics and caregiver-reported symptom changes, our response definition achieves greater clinical relevance than prior efforts reliant solely on AHI thresholds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Each parameter selected for model inclusion aligns with established or emerging pathophysiologic insights. AHI and ODI serve as surrogates for the mechanical and hypoxic burden imposed by upper airway obstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]and their inverse correlation with response likelihood suggests a threshold of disease severity that may render topical anti-inflammatory therapy insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Minimum SpO&#8322;, indicative of global oxygenation during sleep, demonstrated a positive predictive association&#8212;consistent with earlier findings that link preserved gas exchange to improved outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The proportion of REM-related respiratory events, an often-overlooked variable in pediatric cohorts, may reflect neurophysiologic vulnerability during REM sleep and denote a distinct OSA phenotype with variable treatment responsiveness. During REM sleep, there is a physiologic suppression of upper airway dilator muscle tone, which increases pharyngeal collapsibility. This neuromuscular vulnerability may reduce the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatments like intranasal corticosteroids, which primarily target adenotonsillar hypertrophy rather than dynamic airway instability. Additionally, the expression of corticosteroid receptors in upper airway tissues may vary by region and tissue type, potentially influencing response to localized steroid therapy. These mechanisms may help explain why children with a higher burden of REM-related respiratory events were less likely to experience treatment success with INCS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The age-related association may capture developmental alterations in airway anatomy and neuromotor tone that influence corticosteroid efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Collectively, these variables encapsulate the multifactorial underpinnings of pediatric OSA and enable a nuanced risk stratification framework.</p><p id="Par39">Several prior models, such as that of Lee et al. (IJPO, 2022), have focused on predicting outcomes of surgical interventions like adenotonsillectomy based on craniofacial or anatomic features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In contrast, our nomogram is specifically designed to guide non-surgical decision-making, providing individualized probability estimates of response to intranasal corticosteroids in children with mild-to-moderate OSA. This distinction broadens the clinical utility of predictive modeling beyond surgical triage and supports its application in outpatient settings where medical therapy is considered first-line. This nomogram could be integrated into electronic health records to generate automated risk scores during PSG result interpretation, offering real-time support to clinicians when discussing treatment plans with caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Such integration would enhance shared decision-making and help identify patients more likely to benefit from conservative management, thereby avoiding unnecessary surgery.</p><p id="Par40">Positional OSA plays a significant role in AHI variability, particularly in pediatric populations. The absence of positional data in our analysis may limit the interpretability of AHI-derived predictors. Future models should consider incorporating body position metrics to enhance predictive accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">The nomogram derived from this multivariable model transforms complex statistical associations into a user-friendly, graphical interface that supports individualized probability estimation. This approach facilitates clinical application, enabling providers to engage in shared decision-making with caregivers regarding treatment expectations, follow-up intensity, or potential escalation to surgical modalities. That the model sustained predictive accuracy in a prospectively recruited external cohort lends credence to its potential generalizability. Unlike internally validated tools that risk overfitting, our bifurcated design incorporating real-world prospective validation enhances external validity and applicability within routine clinical settings.</p><p id="Par42">Nonetheless, several limitations merit acknowledgment. The study was confined to a single tertiary care center, limiting geographic and ethnic heterogeneity. Although temporal validation strengthens robustness, external replication in diverse populations is essential. The model excludes biochemical, anatomic, or genetic correlates that may further refine predictive precision. Moreover, symptom assessment, though structured, relied on caregiver report rather than validated pediatric scales, which may introduce reporting variability. Despite these limitations, rigorous PSG acquisition protocols, blinded scoring procedures, and standardized treatment regimens enhance methodological rigor and internal consistency.</p><p id="Par43">In summary, this study underscores the utility of integrating PSG-derived and clinical parameters to anticipate pharmacologic response in pediatric OSA. The resulting nomogram offers a pragmatic, interpretable tool to guide individualized therapy and streamline referral pathways. Future research should focus on external multicenter validation and incorporation of additional biomarkers to further advance predictive modeling in pediatric sleep-disordered breathing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par44">In conclusion, this study identified key polysomnographic and clinical predictors of response to intranasal corticosteroids in children with mild-to-moderate OSA and established a validated nomogram to support individualized treatment planning. By integrating routinely available parameters into a clinically interpretable tool, the model may assist clinicians in predicting pharmacologic efficacy, optimizing patient selection, and guiding timely therapeutic decisions in real-world pediatric sleep medicine.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Conceptualization: Y.W., C.C.; Data Curation: Y.W., C.C.; Formal Analysis: Y.W., C.C.; Funding Acquisition: Y.W.; Investigation: Y.W., C.C.; Methodology: Y.W., C.C.; Project Administration: Y.W.; Resources: Y.W., C.C.; Software: Y.W., C.C.; Supervision: Y.W., C.C.; Validation: Y.W., C.C.; Visualization: Y.W., C.C.; Writing - Original Draft: C.C.; Writing - Review &amp; Editing: Y.W.</p></notes><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>This research received no external funding.</p></notes><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></notes><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p id="Par45">The current study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Dongguan Maternal &amp; Child Healthcare Hospital (approval number DCH202401008).
