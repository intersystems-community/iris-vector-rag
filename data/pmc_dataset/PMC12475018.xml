These crosslinks block DNA replication and threaten the stability of the genome. A rare genetic disease, Fanconi anaemia (FA), is marked by extreme sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, including acetaldehyde. Although the Fanconi anaemia DNA repair pathway is known to fix this type of damage, exactly how it repairs acetaldehyde crosslinks is not yet understood. Here we show that the FA nuclease Slx4-Xpf-Ercc1 (SXE) plays a key role in the repair of AA-ICL. Using a DNA replication fork with site-specific AA-ICL, we show that SXE specifically excises this crosslink, highlighting its role in the repair of alcohol-induced DNA interstrand crosslinks. Moreover, SXE performs two precise incisions flanking the AA-ICL and can similarly repair a basic-site DNA interstrand crosslink. These results expand our understanding of how the FA pathway resolves alcohol-induced DNA damage. In addition, they suggest that SXE is a versatile nuclease complex and may be involved in repairing other types of crosslinks that may activate the FA pathway.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The FA nuclease SXE (Slx4-Xpf-Ercc1) excises acetaldehyde-induced DNA interstrand crosslinks, making precise incisions to restore replication.

However, over the years, its use has been associated with adverse health effects. Extensive research has linked alcohol consumption to over 60 diseases, including liver damage, heart disease, neurodegenerative conditions and mental illnesses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Notably, alcohol consumption has been implicated in the development of several types of cancers, particularly within the digestive system. These include cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, colorectal region and liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Alcohol metabolism involves multiple enzymes, with the &#967; isoform of alcohol dehydrogenase primarily responsible for converting alcohol to acetaldehyde. The liver contains the highest concentration of enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism, including acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1 &amp; ALDH2), which plays a crucial role in detoxifying acetaldehyde into acetate (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Heavy alcohol drinkers with ALDH2 deficiency exhibited elevated levels of DNA damage, highlighting the role of ALDH2 in protecting genomic integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Acetaldehyde possesses electrophilic properties that make it an exceptionally reactive compound, interacting with nucleophilic amino and thiol groups alike. It forms covalent bonds with various proteins (tubulin, haemoglobin, lipoproteins, albumin and collagen), as well as with enzymes, microtubules and DNA, ultimately disrupting cell integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Model of alcohol metabolism leading to acetaldehyde interstrand crosslink (AA-ICL).</title><p><bold>A</bold> A schematic representation of the pathway from alcohol consumption through acetaldehyde to DNA damage in the form of AA-ICL (adapted from &#169;irasutoya, wanicon, sketchify, sketchifyedu edited via Canva.com). <bold>B</bold> Model of native AA-ICL formation in vivo.

Repairing DNA ICLs is essential for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing deleterious effects, such as cell cycle arrest, cell death or cancer. The inability to effectively repair ICLs is a hallmark of a genetic disease called Fanconi anaemia (FA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Seminal work has shown that acetaldehyde induces DNA damage, particularly in cells deficient in the FA repair pathway, linking acetaldehyde to DNA damage-related diseases. This research also highlights ethanol&#8217;s harmful effects on foetal development, haematopoiesis, and its teratogenic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">FA is a rare, predominantly autosomal recessive disease that results in bone marrow failure, developmental anomalies, and an increased risk of both haematologic and non-haematologic malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The hypersensitivity of cells derived from FA patients to crosslinking agents led to the discovery of the FA crosslink repair pathway, crucial for repairing ICLs during DNA replication. This discovery highlights the key role of the FA pathway in DNA repair of ICL and underscores its importance in the maintenance of genomic integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">When the replication machinery encounters a DNA crosslink during replication, it stalls. Due to the bidirectional nature of DNA replication, another replication machinery arrives and stalls on the opposite site. The DNA then adopts an X-shaped structure. Subsequently, ATR kinase is activated, recruiting various factors to facilitate the ICL repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These events activate the FA pathway, including the activation of the FA core complex, a large E3 ligase responsible for the ubiquitylation of FANCD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This monoubiquitylation is a hallmark of FA and is crucial for the subsequent excision of the ICL and the initiation of downstream repair processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

Beyond demonstrating the role of acetaldehyde in detoxification in maintaining haematopoiesis, it has been revealed that SLX4-deficient cells are hypersensitive to acetaldehyde treatment, bringing genetic evidence linking aldehyde genotoxicity with Slx4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Furthermore, elevated markers for DNA damage were evident in FA-deficient cell lines, demonstrating the activation of DNA repair pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The acetaldehyde exposure resulted in a significant reduction in the survival of SLX4-deficient, as well as other FA-deficient cells, derived from blood lineage progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, the molecular details of how this lesion is removed remain unclear.</p><p id="Par10">In subsequent work, we synthesised a site-specific alcohol-induced acetaldehyde ICL (AA-ICL). DNA repair experiments conducted in <italic toggle="yes">Xenopus</italic> egg extracts demonstrated that the FA pathway primarily mediates the repair of this ICL, although an alternative repair pathway was also identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Recently, a reduced form of AA-ICL was synthesised by another route, resulting in all imine bonds of the Schiff bases between the crosslink and DNA being in their reduced form. Data from this study strongly suggest that the reduced form of ICLs is exclusively repaired by the FA pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">Here, we focus on unravelling the intricate molecular details surrounding AA-ICL and its subsequent repair by the SXE complex. Specifically, we synthesised a site-specific acetaldehyde crosslink (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The resulting AA-ICL contains a site-specific link between opposite DNA strands, located within the duplex of a replication fork structure, mimicking a stalled replication scenario in the presence of the crosslink. Through enzymatic assays involving SXE, we elucidate the incision mechanism employed by this nuclease complex on the AA-ICL substrate. Our results reveal the efficiency of SXE in cleaving AA-ICL. To expand our investigation, Neil3 glycosylase, a known enzyme involved in the repair of other ICLs in replication-coupled repair, is compared with SXE in the processing of the AA-ICL crosslink and another chemically distinct native ICL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of site-specific alcohol-induced interstrand crosslink</title><p id="Par12">The synthetic crosslink in this study is chemically identical to the alcohol-induced interstrand crosslink (AA-ICL) that forms in DNA following alcohol consumption. A synthetic single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide, modified at a specific site with the 2-InoF residue, was coupled with (4&#8201;<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-4-aminopentan-1,2-diol via an SNAr reaction. In this reaction, the C-2 fluorine atom of the 2-InoF residue can be readily substituted by a nucleophile, such as a primary amine. The resulting product serves as the starting material for producing a chemically identical lesion to that formed by the reaction of two acetaldehyde molecules with guanine within DNA. The 1,2-diol was converted to PdG through oxidation with NaIO<sub>4</sub>. The resulting product was then purified using HPLC. The appropriate fractions were concentrated and used in subsequent crosslinking reactions (schematised in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>).<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>AA-ICL formation and stability rate.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Representation of DNA replication fork substrates used in this study differing in the position of the ICL site and its polarity. <bold>B</bold> 15% denaturing PAGE gel showing AA-ICL formation from annealed DNA fork. <bold>C</bold> The gel bands corresponding to the reactants (ssDNA) and the products of AA-ICL formation (ICL) were quantified.

These substrates contained an identical single-stranded DNA strand with the PdG residue prepared for crosslinking. The opposing strand was designed so the annealed oligonucleotide resembled a DNA replication fork in the shape of the letter Y. In each case, a fluorescent dye was placed at one end of the replication fork to monitor the reaction. Therefore, two 3&#8242; and two 5&#8242; labelled oligonucleotides were synthesised (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Formation and stability of AA-ICL: the rate of formation of AA-ICL is relatively slow, but so is its degradation</title><p id="Par14">The formation of DNA crosslinks was observed in different oligonucleotides containing the naturally identical lesion PdG (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). The oligonucleotides were annealed, and the crosslinking reaction was carried out in the dark. Subsamples were taken at selected intervals to determine the percentage of AA-ICL formed within the reaction mixture. The reaction was resolved on a 15% denaturing PAGE gel, and the reaction rate was 0.1% per day (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B, C</xref>). To revalidate that the crosslink forms specifically between PdG and the opposing dG, the dG was replaced with inosine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The crosslink was formed only within the duplex containing PdG with the opposing dG. In the case of the inosine-containing oligonucleotide, no crosslink was observed, confirming the necessity of the C-2 amino group (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">After the crosslinking reaction, the AA-ICL was purified from the gel. To address the stability of AA-ICL, the purified crosslinked DNA was allowed to degrade over time at 37&#8201;&#176;C. The reactions were analysed on a denaturing gel, similar to the method used for formation analysis. The half-time of two AA-ICLs was t<sub>1/2 AA-ICL1</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;2.12&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.05 days and t<sub>1/2 AA-ICL3</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;2.88&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.05 days. From this experiment, it was evident that degradation is again a relatively slow process, and the reaction does not reach full conversion. It appears that the crosslink forms an equilibrium with non-crosslinked DNA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Nuclease complex SXE unhooks alcohol-derived DNA interstrand crosslink</title><p id="Par16">To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which the FA nuclease complex SXE repairs AA-ICL in enzymatic reactions, we utilised non-crosslinked and crosslinked DNA forks that only differ by the presence of site-specific AA-ICL and fluorescent probes in different locations of the fork.

These lesions are particularly problematic because of their persistence in the genome. Their slow hydrolytic degradation leaves them intact for prolonged periods. If not repaired, AA-ICLs can block essential cellular processes like transcription and replication.

The phthalimide protection was exchanged for a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) in a one-pot, three-step sequence affording the Cbz-protected intermediate in 56&#8211;63% yield. The terminal double bond was dihydroxylated using the RuCl<sub>3</sub>-CeCl<sub>3</sub> catalytic system and sodium periodate as an oxidising agent. The resulting diol (49% yield) was isolated as a diastereomeric mixture (ca 1:1). Cleavage of the Cbz protecting group was achieved hydrogenolytically on a Pearlman&#8217;s catalyst. No chromatographic purification of the free amine was necessary in this final step. The overall yield of the synthesis was slightly lower than reported in the literature.
