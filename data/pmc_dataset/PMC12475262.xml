Y-type ventilation combined with gob-side entry retaining has been applied to improve gas dispersion; however, airflow convergence can still result in high methane concentrations near the return airway. To address this, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed to simulate methane migration in the goaf under different drainage strategies. Results indicate that methane concentration increases with elevation and distance from the working face, and is consistently higher along the gob-side entry than on the intake side. Buried pipelines effectively reduced methane levels near the floor and along the gob-side, while high-level boreholes were more effective in the caved zone but less so in the overlying fractured zone. A combined drainage approach was found to yield the most comprehensive reduction across all regions of the goaf. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing methane control in Y-type ventilated mining operations.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Gob-side entry</kwd><kwd>Y-type ventilation</kwd><kwd>Goaf</kwd><kwd>Methane migration</kwd><kwd>CFD</kwd><kwd>Numerical simulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Energy science and technology</kwd><kwd>Engineering</kwd><kwd>Environmental sciences</kwd><kwd>Solid Earth sciences</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>51974108</award-id><award-id>51404093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Feiyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>232300420077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Scientific and Technological Project of Henan Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>242102320213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Fundamental Research Funds for the Universities of Henan Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>NSFRF240638</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Post-doctoral Research Project in Henan Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>001701014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par10">Coal remains a cornerstone of China&#8217;s energy system and accounts for a major share of the country&#8217;s primary energy consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As shallow coal resources are gradually depleted, mining activities have extended to deeper seams, exposing operations to complex geological conditions such as elevated in-situ stress, high methane pressure, and intense mining-induced disturbances. These challenges have rendered traditional mining technologies increasingly inadequate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Although advanced technologies such as intelligent mining and precision geological exploration have greatly improved safety and efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>&#160;methane-related hazards remain a major concern in deep coal mining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Methane explosions are consistently the leading cause of coal mine accidents in China, highlighting the urgent need for effective gas control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Compared to traditional U-type ventilation systems, Y-type ventilation with gob-side entry not only reduces coal loss but also mitigates methane accumulation in the upper corner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, due to the convergence of airflow, this configuration can result in methane over-concentration in the return airway, thereby threatening mine safety.</p><p id="Par11">In response to these challenges, numerous scholars have conducted relevant research. Zhang et al. used numerical simulations to investigate key factors influencing methane emission from residual coal in the goaf and concluded that a modified Y-type ventilation system can not only control methane accumulation in the upper corner but also effectively prevent spontaneous combustion of residual coal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

Geng et al. investigated air leakage flow fields and multi-component methane concentration distributions in the goaf based on the &#8220;O-ring&#8221; theory and found that methane and oxygen concentrations under Y-type ventilation exhibited an approximate &#8220;L-shaped&#8221; spatial pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

Recent international studies have increasingly used advanced CFD modeling techniques to investigate methane distribution and control strategies in goaf environments.

In particular, limited attention has been paid to comparing the performance of different drainage strategies&#8212;such as buried pipes, high-level directional boreholes, and their combination&#8212;under such ventilation systems. To address this gap, this study selects the 2206 working face of the Lutaishan Coal Mine as a representative case and employs computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling via Fluent to simulate methane migration under various drainage configurations. The objective is to quantitatively assess the extraction performance of each method, clarify the spatial migration characteristics of methane, and propose targeted optimization strategies for methane control in goafs with Y-type ventilation and gob-side entry retaining.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>General description of the working face</title><p id="Par13">The surface of the 2206 working face is located in the Beiling and Maoyaogou area, with ground elevations ranging from +&#8201;1103.13&#160;m to +&#8201;982.94&#160;m. This working face is situated in the northwestern part of the mining area, with its northern end adjacent to the mine boundary, and its southern end connected to the Main return airway, track roadway, and belt roadway of the mining district.

First, the model assumes steady-state conditions and does not consider time-dependent changes in gas emission or ventilation parameters. Second, the goaf is simplified as a homogeneous porous medium, which may not fully reflect the complex spatial variability of porosity and permeability in real field settings. Third, the boundary conditions and gas emission parameters are based on design documents and engineering estimates rather than continuous field monitoring data, which may introduce discrepancies between simulated and actual conditions. Finally, interactions between methane flow and dynamic coal deformation or roof collapse were not included. These simplifications, while necessary for model tractability, may lead to deviations in predicting gas distribution. Future work should aim to incorporate more detailed geological and temporal data to improve model fidelity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par78">(1) The spatial distribution of methane concentration in the goaf is distinct and exhibits a clear pattern. Vertically, concentrations increase with elevation&#8212;being lower in the caved zone and higher in the fractured zone. Horizontally, higher concentrations are observed along the gob-side entry compared to areas near the Main intake airway. Near the intake side, methane levels remain low, with a volume fraction below 1%. In contrast, deep regions of the goaf located far from the working face exhibit significant methane accumulation, with concentrations reaching up to 95%, indicating a serious risk of gas buildup.</p><p id="Par79">(2) Buried pipe drainage exhibits a localized control effect. While the overall concentration in the goaf shows only a slight and stable decrease, methane concentration along the gob-side entry decreases significantly. This indicates that buried pipe extraction is highly effective in controlling methane accumulation in targeted regions, making it suitable for areas requiring focused drainage.</p><p id="Par80">(3) The effectiveness of directional high-level borehole drainage is limited by poor permeability in the fractured zone. Although it reduces methane concentration in the caved zone, its performance is suboptimal in the fractured zone due to low porosity and poor fracture connectivity. For high-methane coal seams, increasing borehole density in the fractured zone is recommended to enhance extraction efficiency.</p><p id="Par81">(4) The combined use of buried pipes and high-level boreholes offers more effective and balanced methane control. This method reduces concentrations in both the caved and fractured zones and enhances spatial coverage of extraction. The results suggest its potential for broader engineering application, particularly in complex goaf environments.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank LetPub (www.letpub.com.cn) for its linguistic assistance during the preparation of this manuscript.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Formal analysis, investigation, writing&#8212;original draft preparation, F.Z. and Y.H.; resources, data curation, super vision, project administration, funding acquisition, F.Z., Z.Y., and C.W.; writing&#8212;review and editing, F.Z. and Y.H.
