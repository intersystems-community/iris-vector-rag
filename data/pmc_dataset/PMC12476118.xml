A large proportion (77.9%, n=60) had no formal BMS training, and less than half (42.9%, n=33) had clinical exposure to real-life BMS patients during medical school placements. There was strong interest in additional training, reinforcing the need to integrate BMS education into undergraduate and/or early postgraduate medical training in the UK.</p><p>From the 2024&#8211;25 academic year onwards, all UK medical students must pass the United Kingdom Medical Licensing Assessment (UKMLA) before obtaining medical registration<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. A review of the UKMLA content map confirms that obesity is included as an examinable condition<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. However, BMS is not explicitly mentioned<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, perhaps due to its relatively recent emergence as a mainstream surgical intervention. Traditional surgical education remains heavily focused on acute conditions (e.g. appendicitis, pancreatitis, intestinal obstruction) and cancer-related surgery<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. This raises questions about variability in BMS teaching across UK medical schools, as formal curriculum inclusion is not yet standardised. Future studies could explore these discrepancies across institutions and compare UK undergraduate BMS education with that of other countries. Findings could then inform recommendations for integrating BMS into future UK medical curricula, ensuring FY1 doctors feel more confident managing BMS patients.</p><sec><title>Knowledge Gaps and Misconceptions</title><p>Our study identified specific knowledge gaps, most notably a lack of awareness regarding obesity classification. Only 57.1% (n=44) correctly identified the BMI threshold for obesity (&#8805;30), which may impact the early recognition and management of obesity-related complications. Early identification is crucial for preventing comorbidities by initiating obesity management strategies or initiating appropriate referrals as early as possible.</p><p>Furthermore, misconceptions persist regarding the causes of obesity and the role of BMS. A substantial proportion (41.6%, n=32) of respondents believed obesity is self-inflicted, reflecting a limited understanding of its complex, multifactorial nature. Obesity is driven by a combination of genetic, metabolic, psychological, socio-economic and environmental factors<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Misconceptions like these can influence patient interactions, potentially leading to stigma, biases in clinical decision-making, and inadequate advice (e.g. advising &#8220;eat less, move more,&#8221; which is neither evidence-based nor effective for many patients).</p><p>Additionally, 7.8% (n=6) of respondents viewed BMS as primarily cosmetic, and 20.8% (n=16) opposed NHS funding for BMS. While lifestyle and dietary modifications were the most commonly endorsed long-term interventions from respondents, evidence shows that BMS is the most effective treatment for sustained weight loss and remission of obesity-related diseases<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. These findings suggest potential barriers to appropriate referrals for BMS, as doctors who lack understanding of its benefits may delay escalation to specialist obesity services. This underscores the urgent need for enhanced education on obesity as a disease and the evidence supporting BMS as an effective intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Demand for More Training and Preferred Learning Approaches</title><p>Encouragingly, most respondents (84.4%, n=65) recognised the gaps in their BMS education and supported its formal integration into medical training. Additionally, 71.4% (n=55) expressed interest in attending additional BMS workshops, reinforcing the need for structured learning opportunities. Interestingly, this demand was not limited to those who had never received prior training, suggesting that even those with some exposure felt their training was insufficient.</p><p>While FY1 doctors demonstrated good overall recognition of bariatric procedures, this did not correlate with confidence in managing BMS patients. Only 20.8% (n=16) felt comfortable managing these patients, despite the majority being familiar with at least some of the surgical techniques. Clinical exposure appeared to play a more significant role than formal training in determining confidence (though the relationship did not reach statistical significance). This suggests that BMS education initiatives should emphasise clinical exposure, rather than didactic learning alone.</p><p>Only a small proportion of respondents had real-life experience with BMS patients, highlighting the need for increased clinical exposure during medical school. Opportunities to engage with BMS rotations and interact with post-operative patients should be actively promoted. The free-text responses further emphasise the importance of peri-operative care (e.g. nutritional support, post-operative monitoring, and complication management) over procedural knowledge. Given that FY1 doctors are more likely to manage BMS patients peri-operatively rather than performing surgery, training should focus on these aspects, aligning with their future responsibilities.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. Firstly, as participation was voluntary, there is a risk of self-selection bias, whereby respondents may have had greater pre-existing interest in BMS or medical education, potentially inflating the proportion of FY1 doctors desiring additional training. Additionally, we did not collect data on participants&#8217; medical school of origin, introducing potential sampling bias. If a significant portion of respondents trained at institutions with limited BMS education, this could have exaggerated the perceived gap in formal teaching and clinical exposure. Future studies should include a broader representation of medical school backgrounds to determine whether gaps in education are widespread or institution-specific.</p><p>The questionnaire was brief and did not assess depth of understanding regarding bariatric procedures or peri-operative management. While familiarity with procedures was evaluated, no formal assessment of clinical competence or decision-making was performed, limiting our ability to determine whether knowledge gaps translate into suboptimal clinical practice.</p><p>Lastly, this study was conducted within a single UK region (South-East London) and limited to seven hospitals within the London Foundation School, restricting generalisability to a national level. A larger, multi-deanery or nationwide study would provide a more representative sample and better inform educational policy. While free-text responses suggested a preference for BMS education to focus on perioperative care, rather than the procedural knowledge, these insights could be more rigorously evaluated through focus groups or the implementation of BMS training followed by prospective assessments of confidence and competency levels.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights significant gaps in knowledge, clinical exposure, and confidence among FY1 doctors regarding BMS. A lack of formal training, persistent misconceptions, and low confidence levels indicate a need for curriculum revisions and targeted educational interventions.</p><p>We recommend the integration of BMS education into undergraduate curricula, ensuring standardised core teaching across UK medical schools. Educational interventions should prioritise clinical exposure and emphasise peri-operative management rather than procedural details, aligning with FY1 doctors&#8217; clinical responsibilities. Increased exposure and structured teaching may also help address obesity-related stigma and misconceptions. By implementing these changes, medical education can better equip future doctors to manage the increasing burden of obesity and deliver appropriate, evidence-based, and unbiased care for patients undergoing BMS.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><title>Author Declarations:</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Conflict of Interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding statement: The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Ethics statement: As mentioned in the manuscript above, The UK National Research Ethics Service decision tool (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk</ext-link>) confirmed that this study did not require formal ethical approval.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>UMJ is an open access publication of the Ulster Medical Society (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.ums.ac.uk" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.ums.ac.uk</ext-link>).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES:</title><ref id="b1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><collab>World Health Organization</collab><source>Obesity and overweight [Internet]</source><publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc><publisher-name>World Health Organization</publisher-name><year>2025</year><comment>cited 2025 Feb 8.
