Introduction</title><p>Occupational safety and health (OSH) in mining and construction is of particular significance in these industries, which are characterised by a high risk of accidents and injuries. With the progression of technology, novel prospects emerge for the automation of technological processes and the enhancement of employee safety. The introduction of modern technologies is imperative for enhancing working conditions and cultivating a proactive safety culture.</p><p>In our two-part series, innovative technologies for improving occupational safety in mining and construction are understood as new or significantly improved technologies, tools, systems, or processes that introduce novelty, bring economic or social benefits and are effectively implemented in practice, leading to advances and breakthroughs in various aspects of occupational safety and health.</p><p>The integration of modern technologies has been demonstrated to have a direct and positive impact on employee safety. Additionally, they enhance workers&#8217; awareness and commitment to OSH regulations, thereby fortifying their capacity to manage crises, hazardous incidents, and accidents through the provision of timely information, realistic training, and effective support tools. As demonstrated by Al-Bayati [<xref rid="B1-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and Sidani et al. [<xref rid="B2-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the integration of technology with direct human use has been shown to significantly raise employee awareness of OSH principles and contribute to the development of a safety culture in the workplace. The identification and elimination of hazards in the workplace have become fundamental tasks that require innovative solutions [<xref rid="B3-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The introduction of appropriate tools and systems has been shown to reduce the risk of accidents and strengthen preventive strategies [<xref rid="B4-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which in turn promotes the development of an appropriate OSH culture in the workplace.</p><p>OSH culture, defined as a set of values, beliefs, and norms relating to safety, plays a key role in effective safety management in organisations [<xref rid="B5-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the process of cultivating a safety culture within an organisational context, it is imperative that employees are instilled with a sense of personal responsibility for the safety of the workplace. In the context of mining and construction, where work processes are often complex and demanding, the establishment of a positive safety culture becomes of even greater importance. The provision of support for educational and training initiatives for employees by team leaders has been demonstrated to engender heightened commitment to OSH regulations, which can ultimately result in a reduction in accidents [<xref rid="B6-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The efficacy of safety training in enhancing awareness, encompassing the knowledge and skills of employees regarding OSH regulations, is a pivotal aspect [<xref rid="B7-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>It is evident that the mining and construction sectors are becoming increasingly resilient to accidents and dangerous incidents. This is primarily due to dynamic technological progress and growing awareness of the importance of shaping a safety culture. However, it is important to emphasise that the implementation of these technologies must be done in a considered manner and adapted to the particularities of the workplace, as this will influence their effectiveness and acceptance among employees [<xref rid="B8-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the context of the specific working conditions prevalent in the mining and construction industries, there is a need for the ongoing research and implementation of effective technical solutions. This necessity arises from the imperative to guarantee efficacious measures that ensure the protection of workers in the workplace. Moreover, contemporary training methodologies are progressively assuming an indispensable role within safety management strategies. Consequently, it is incumbent upon companies to invest in the development and implementation of tools that enhance employees&#8217; competence in the field of safety and engender a substantial increase in safety levels.</p><p>On the basis of the preceding discussion on the implementation of technology and its impact on safety culture, <xref rid="sensors-25-05717-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> presents a framework that classifies technical solutions according to the manner in which they enhance work safety. The initial segment encompasses intelligent systems that are predicated on sensors and information technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles, inspection robots, Internet of Things networks with smart sensors, and artificial intelligence platforms that primarily function to monitor working conditions, detect hazards in real time, and predict dangerous events. The primary objective of these platforms is to reduce the number of accidents and to safeguard the health of workers. The subsequent section delves into the technologies employed by workers in the workplace or during training. These include augmented and virtual reality, personal protective equipment for both individuals and groups, and exoskeletons. The objective of these technologies is to safeguard personnel from direct hazards, enhance work comfort, and educate personnel on safe behaviours through realistic, immersive instructions.</p><p>The aim of this article (Part II) is to attempt to systematise and analyse the most significant modern technologies for improving occupational safety that are used or can be implemented in the mining and construction sectors and are used directly by humans in the work environment or in the training process. To be more precise, Part I dealt with system technologies (drones and inspection robots, Internet of things and sensors, artificial intelligence), while Part II focuses on technologies used directly by employees (augmented and virtual reality, personal and collective protective equipment, exoskeletons). Solutions that are already functioning as stand-alone techniques are analysed, as well as the possibilities of combining them. The emphasis placed on the identification of technological development directions that have the potential to contribute to a reduction in the number of accidents at work, an increase in the effectiveness of occupational safety management, and an improvement in the quality of training and supervision of compliance with OSH procedures is particularly noteworthy. In <xref rid="sec4-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="sec">Section 4</xref>, a comparative table is presented which details all modern technologies that have been selected for the study. This facilitated the discussion of the combination of the technologies discussed in this section of the article with all other technologies, including those discussed in Part I. These considerations have enabled the identification of practical examples of technological implementations, the identification of barriers to their implementation, and the formulation of recommendations for further research and development of technologies to improve working conditions and protect the life and health of workers in both sectors analysed.</p><p>Mining and construction are examined together in this study because both industries are characterised by high occupational risks, complex technological processes and demanding working environments that necessitate continuous improvements in safety management. While their specific working conditions differ, they share common challenges such as operating in confined or hazardous spaces, exposure to dynamic natural or structural factors and the need for advanced training and protective solutions. A joint analysis of these sectors not only reveals their differences but also uncovers transferable practices and synergies that can facilitate the adoption of innovative technologies across both fields. By adopting a broader comparative perspective, this publication highlights the interconnections and complementarities among different groups of technologies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how they can collectively enhance occupational safety and operational efficiency in mining and construction.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-sensors-25-05717"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>The literature review employed a desk research methodology, whereby research is conducted from behind a desk. Also known as secondary analysis, it involves collecting, analysing and interpreting published data. In the context of a literature review, desk research relies on foundational sources such as academic articles, reports, books, statistical data and publications from research institutions. This method enables the efficient and rapid acquisition of information, eliminating the need for field research [<xref rid="B9-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A key element of desk research is critically analysing and evaluating the reliability, validity and relevance of sources to the research topic. Despite the fact that desk research allows specific research problems to be answered with little financial and organisational effort, it is still an underutilised analytical technique in research [<xref rid="B11-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To illustrate the methodology undertaken and the subsequent steps of conducting research on the issue, the following diagram is presented (<xref rid="sensors-25-05717-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The same research methodology was used in both parts of the articles (Part I and Part II). The only difference in the methodology is the keywords used in the Scopus search.</p><p>Source analysis was carried out based on the keywords established in <xref rid="sensors-25-05717-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Two sets of keywords were selected: &#8216;mining engineering&#8217; and &#8216;civil engineering&#8217;. The research was conducted using the Scopus database. The literature review covered the period from 1997 to 2024 and included only original scientific articles and conference papers written in English. As a result, a total of 154 records were obtained. All the selected publications were analysed in detail, and those not related to occupational safety in mining and civil engineering were excluded. Based on these publications, the technologies used to improve occupational safety were characterised. The analysis revealed an increasing interest in the topic, which may suggest the development and popularity of innovative technologies and their application in various areas of mining and civil engineering. The above conclusion is illustrated in the graphs (<xref rid="sensors-25-05717-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="sensors-25-05717-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The only difference in the methodology is the keywords used in the Scopus search.</p><p>A review of the literature was conducted to assess the potential for combining technologies to improve occupational safety.

Results</title><sec id="sec3dot1-sensors-25-05717"><title>3.1. Augmented and Virtual Reality</title><p>Virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) are advanced technologies that create interactive, three-dimensional environments simulating the real world. In the context of high-risk sectors, such as mining and construction, the use of these devices has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing occupational safety standards. The utilisation of VR and AR facilitates the presentation of objects and the recreation of realistic action scenarios, in addition to conducting training in conditions that approximate real-life scenarios, whilst eliminating the exposure of workers to actual hazards. The technology is utilised in the domains of hazard analysis, evacuation planning, the testing of emergency procedures, and the training of personnel in the operation of complex machinery and systems. The utilisation of virtual reality and augmented reality in training regimens has been demonstrated to facilitate the acquisition of experiential knowledge and the development of competencies in a controlled setting, thereby markedly diminishing the likelihood of accidents and operational errors. Furthermore, the utilisation of virtual simulations facilitates the identification of deficiencies in extant health and safety systems, thereby enabling their continual enhancement. The integration of virtual and augmented reality into investment design and monitoring processes has been demonstrated to engender enhanced safety measures and concurrently effectuate a reduction in costs associated with occupational accidents and periods of downtime. It is evident that VR and AR not only promote worker well-being, but also contribute to environmental protection by reducing incidents that could lead to contamination or damage to infrastructure [<xref rid="B13-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>It is imperative for graduates to possess a fundamental understanding of the equipment and machinery employed within the industry upon their entry. This is primarily due to the fact that they have received training on outdated equipment, due to the lack of modern equipment in educational institutions. The primary impediment pertains to constrained financial resources, which hinders the recruitment of qualified personnel, their ongoing professional development, and the acquisition of contemporary teaching materials and technological resources. Universities are unable to keep up with industry developments; therefore, the education sector must undergo a transformation. Technologies such as AR and VR are playing an increasingly important role in practical learning, enabling the creation of realistic simulations and the development of spatial skills and understanding of complex technical concepts [<xref rid="B16-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Virtual reality can be defined as a system that, through the combination of devices and computer programmes, enables the user to have an immersive experience in the digital world, thereby stimulating their perception [<xref rid="B18-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The utilisation of visualisation techniques has been demonstrated to facilitate the comprehension of complex concepts by rendering them graphically, thereby enabling their perusal at any time and in any location. The efficacy of VR and AR training has been demonstrated for a wide range of users, irrespective of age or experience, and has been met with a positive response. In order to realise the potential of VR and AR, it is necessary to utilise devices that facilitate the effective use of the software. The primary benefits of VR and AR are realism and immersion, which engender a sense of inhabiting a simulated or augmented reality as if it were reality itself. The development of graphics engines and software tools is facilitating the creation of interfaces in VR and AR environments. These interfaces utilise three-dimensional graphics to facilitate intuitive interaction with both virtual and real objects [<xref rid="B19-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><sec id="sec3dot1dot1-sensors-25-05717"><title>3.1.1. Mining Engineering</title><p>In recent years, there has been an increasing use of VR and AR technologies in the mining industry. Visualisation has been demonstrated to facilitate the accurate consideration of past experiences and events, thereby enabling more informed decision-making. Furthermore, the utilisation of remote control technology has been demonstrated to facilitate the process of mapping virtual models to the actual mine layout [<xref rid="B23-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The utilisation of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) simulation has emerged as a highly effective training and educational tool, facilitating the emulation of perilous and unorthodox conditions within mining environments, and the resolution of intricate challenges. The potential for the successful application of VR and AR technologies to mining operations is significant. One such example is the employment of interactive simulators for the training of operators of multiple excavators. The findings suggest that immersive simulator training can yield quantifiable, short-term performance enhancements for experienced multi-excavator operators [<xref rid="B26-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the contemporary context, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are being employed with considerable efficacy in the mining industry for the purposes of data visualisation, accident reconstruction, simulation applications, risk analysis, hazard awareness and training [<xref rid="B21-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B27-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>In the contemporary mining industry, employees are expected to demonstrate high levels of professional competence and the capacity to effectively function in challenging environments. Innovative virtual and augmented reality technologies have emerged as pivotal tools in the training and upskilling of mining personnel. Realistic simulations of the work environment have been shown to facilitate effective training for both students and industry professionals. The integration of VR and AR is becoming increasingly central to digital transformation, with significant implications for the manufacturing and educational sectors. The university&#8217;s collaboration with industry fosters the development of curricula, specialised courses and interdisciplinary research, thereby promoting the establishment of a digital culture and preparing personnel to face future technological challenges [<xref rid="B30-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Augmented and virtual reality are finding increasing use in mining, particularly in the area of workplace safety. The use of augmented and virtual reality has enabled the creation of realistic simulations of underground hazards, facilitating the training of workers in a controlled environment without the need for exposure to actual risks. The implementation of these technologies facilitates the dissemination of real-time data, including the location of emergency exits, hazardous areas and machine parameters, directly to the worker&#8217;s field of vision. This is achieved through the use of specialised glasses or mobile devices. Consequently, there is an enhancement in awareness of potential hazards and the capacity to respond expeditiously in emergency situations. Furthermore, AR and VR have been demonstrated to facilitate the identification of potential failures in inspection and maintenance processes, thereby contributing to the prevention of accidents. The mining industry is characterised by a high risk of accidents; consequently, the provision of effective safety training for employees is of paramount importance. Virtual and augmented reality offer an engaging and realistic environment in which to simulate hazardous situations, resulting in better recall and understanding of procedures [<xref rid="B14-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B31-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The utilisation of VR and AR facilitates the safe exploration of risks within a controlled environment, thereby enabling employees to learn from errors in a virtual or augmented setting without the concern of tangible repercussions. The most significant advantage is the capacity to replicate situations that are challenging to simulate in reality. For instance, virtual and augmented reality facilitate the simulation of complex scenarios, such as an explosion in a mine, which would be impractical or prohibitively expensive to recreate in a physical setting. It appears that enhancing engagement and motivation is also of significance. The interactive nature of VR and AR has been demonstrated to enhance the appeal and engagement of training programmes.

In response to this challenge, a sophisticated exoskeleton system equipped with advanced motion monitoring capabilities was developed. Studies [<xref rid="B76-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] have validated the efficacy of this innovation in reducing exertion and discomfort, including in the lower back region. An evaluation of the viability of exoskeletons in various construction tasks was conducted by [<xref rid="B77-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Since 2021, the results of practical research have been appearing. Exoskeletons have been utilised by concrete workers, steel fixers, fitters and general construction workers, providing coverage for the lower and upper limbs and the spine. For instance, a passive lower limb exoskeleton employed for the purpose of concrete spraying has been demonstrated to reduce stress levels [<xref rid="B78-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].

Furthermore, issues of liability in case of system malfunction remain unresolved, highlighting the need for clear legal guidelines on the responsibilities of employers, developers, and manufacturers. The absence of specific certification standards for head-mounted displays and wearable exoskeletons further complicates their safe adoption. Addressing these ethical and legal aspects through regulatory frameworks, transparent communication, and participatory design is crucial to ensuring not only technical efficiency but also trust and fairness in the deployment of innovative safety technologies [<xref rid="B103-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>,<xref rid="B104-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,<xref rid="B105-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>].</p><p>In view of the increasing significance of VR and AR, there is a necessity for further research to enhance occupational safety.

Innovative Personal Protective Equipment and Collective Protective Equipment</title><p>Personal and collective protective equipment plays a fundamental and key role in ensuring occupational safety in any industry. Despite the prevalence of simple solutions to these problems, there is an increasing demand for more innovative solutions, which are often tailored to the specific needs of the industry in which they are employed (e.g., cooling vests for underground miners or helmets equipped with fall sensors for construction workers). Technological advances, the evolution of materials science and the integration of digital systems with traditional engineering solutions have facilitated the development of more advanced, effective and ergonomic forms of protection for workers exposed to various occupational hazards.</p><p>The implementation of innovative personal and collective protective measures is primarily aimed at increasing the effectiveness of protecting the health and life of employees. The advent of contemporary safety helmets, intelligent cooling systems, vital signs monitoring vests and toxic gas detection systems that are based on real-time data analysis has resulted in a marked enhancement in the level of safety, thereby enabling a swift response in emergency situations. Innovative PPE is distinguished by its enhanced user-friendliness, which in turn fosters greater acceptance among employees. The introduction of breathable, lightweight and resistant materials has resulted in a significant reduction in the burden of protective equipment during routine work activities [<xref rid="B106-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. This, in turn, has the effect of reducing the number of cases of improper use or complete omission of PPE. Furthermore, contemporary protective measures facilitate their integration with information technologies, thereby enabling continuous monitoring of working conditions and immediate alerting about danger. The continuous development of technologies, ranging from enhanced energy absorbers to intelligent personal protective equipment monitoring and detection systems, has engendered novel opportunities for the prevention of accidents and the enhancement of workers&#8217; health protection [<xref rid="B107-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>].</p><p>The effective implementation of these measures requires a comprehensive analysis of risks, with consideration of employee perceptions, the elimination of organisational and financial barriers, and the consideration of individual user needs. Furthermore, contemporary protective equipment, which is equipped with electronic systems, has the potential to be unreliable in harsh environmental conditions (e.g., dust, humidity, etc.). Improper operation or misinterpretation of data can engender a false sense of security and result in a delayed response to a genuine threat. The implementation of advanced technologies necessitates the provision of adequate training for personnel and the integration of novel safety procedures, which can incur supplementary expenses and may encounter resistance from staff members, particularly in facilities exhibiting a low degree of digitisation.</p><p>Further research directions should focus on</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Developing environmentally resilient protective systems that will be able to operate reliably in extreme conditions of the working environment;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The development of universal systems for the integration of data from various sources (sensors, cameras, biological data) in order to create coherent safety management systems;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Research on the psychological and social aspects of the acceptance of new collective and individual protection measures by employees and the development of effective training and implementation strategies.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec4dot1dot3-sensors-25-05717"><title>4.1.3. Exoskeletons</title><p>Exoskeletons represent a novel solution for enhancing the physical performance of employees in the construction and mining industries during their professional duties. The utilisation of these devices has been demonstrated to exert a substantial contribution to the enhancement of occupational safety and the mitigation of strain on the musculoskeletal system [<xref rid="B108-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>,<xref rid="B109-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. In the context of construction and mining, where high-risk work is performed, often in a forced body position and with high physical loads, exoskeletons are a potential tool to reduce the risk of injuries and accidents. The primary benefits of exoskeletons are the reduction in muscle fatigue and pain resulting from overload. The distribution of forces and support for body movements is achieved by these devices, thereby reducing strain on the spine, joints and muscles, and consequently minimising the risk of overload injuries [<xref rid="B85-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B108-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>,<xref rid="B109-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Furthermore, the enhancement of work ergonomics through the integration of exoskeletons has been demonstrated to engender an augmentation in efficiency, whilst concomitantly extending the duration of specific activities without compromising the physical condition of the employee.</p><p>The use of exoskeletons is associated with certain risks and limitations. A number of studies have been conducted on the use of exoskeletons in recent years; however, many of them are characterised by a limited sample size, ranging from just four participants [<xref rid="B82-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] to a maximum of forty-one [<xref rid="B91-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Such small study groups may not provide sufficient representativeness of the results, making it difficult to draw general conclusions on a wider population of construction workers. In addition, most of these studies were carried out under controlled laboratory conditions, which do not always reflect the complexity and dynamics of real construction sites or mines.</p><p>The current literature highlights the necessity for precise design and continuous improvement of exoskeleton construction to minimise potential undesirable side effects. For instance, a reduction in the load on one muscle group may lead to an increase in the load on other groups, as noted by [<xref rid="B79-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B80-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the compatibility of exoskeletons with existing safety measures on construction sites, including protective harnesses, which may limit their practical application [<xref rid="B80-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. A further significant restriction pertains to the paucity of research that considers the long-term implications of exoskeletons and their effect on the well-being and health of users. The majority of extant research has focused on short-term experiments, without analysing the potential effects of many months or years of use of these devices. This is a crucial aspect for evaluating the practical usefulness of exoskeletons in everyday work. It is evident that further research is required in order to ascertain the long-term impact of exoskeleton use on workers&#8217; health, as well as to determine the extent of user acceptance of this technology.</p><p>In addition, it is imperative to investigate the potential incorporation of exoskeletons into prevailing occupational health and safety processes and procedures. In order to enhance comprehension of the practical aspects inherent in the implementation of this technology, it is imperative that real-world field trials are conducted. It is recommended that future research efforts concentrate on the adaptation or development of novel exoskeleton solutions that are tailored to the particular requirements of specific industries, such as construction and mining. These solutions have the potential to enhance safety and productivity among workers. In addition, exoskeletons must be designed to facilitate integration with other elements of the employee&#8217;s equipment. Furthermore, it is essential to ensure that they are adapted to work in confined spaces, such as narrow shafts and mine environments. The devices must be adjustable in terms of fit and level of support, durable, easy to clean, and must not hinder workers in their fundamental tasks.</p><p>Research also indicates the considerable impact of exoskeletons on the cognitive functions of workers, which poses a significant challenge for designers and manufacturers of these devices. In the context of forthcoming research and development initiatives, a primary objective should be to mitigate this effect. This is imperative to ensure that the integration of exoskeletons into routine practice will yield the anticipated benefits without compromising the health and well-being of users.</p><p>In the context of future research on the use of exoskeletons, several significant directions can be indicated:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Research on the long-term impact of their use on the health of employees, including the analysis of biomechanical and adaptive changes in the body;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The development of technologies enabling individual adjustment of exoskeletons to the body structure of the user and the specifics of the tasks performed;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The integration of exoskeletons with health and work environment monitoring systems, which will enable the creation of a comprehensive employee protection system.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-sensors-25-05717"><title>4.2. Inter-Technological Integration&#8212;Opportunities and Limitations</title><p>Recent technological advancements have provided a range of opportunities to enhance occupational safety and health conditions, particularly in high-risk sectors such as mining and construction. The advent of innovative solutions, encompassing virtual and augmented reality, unmanned aerial vehicles and inspection robots, the Internet of Things and intelligent sensor systems, modern personal and collective protective equipment, exoskeletons and artificial intelligence, has precipitated a paradigm shift in the realm of occupational safety management. The utilisation of these technologies, whether in isolation or in conjunction with one another, facilitates the precise monitoring of hazards and the analysis of working conditions and the working environment. In addition, these technologies enable the prediction and effective prevention of dangerous situations. The potential of combining these technologies, as well as the limitations of such combinations, are summarised in <xref rid="sensors-25-05717-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p><sec id="sec4dot2dot1-sensors-25-05717"><title>4.2.1. Opportunities on the Use and Mixing of Modern Technologies</title><p>The integration of innovative technologies to enhance occupational safety in the mining and construction sectors presents numerous opportunities. The integration of virtual reality and augmented reality with exoskeletons represents a promising, albeit nascent, synergy in the context of enhancing occupational safety in high-risk sectors. The integration of VR and AR with exoskeletons facilitates the acquisition of optimal techniques and attitudes for professional tasks, enhancing safety and ergonomics in the workplace. For instance, the seamless integration of reality and virtual training has been demonstrated to enhance the efficiency of equipment utilisation and mitigate the risk of injuries arising from incorrect posture or excessive exertion. The utilisation of augmented reality has been demonstrated to facilitate the visualisation of optimal working postures, ranges of motion and load limits for the operator of the exoskeleton. Augmented reality has the capacity to display visual alerts in the employee&#8217;s field of vision when their posture exceeds safe parameters. Furthermore, the utilisation of VR and AR simulations facilitates the collection of data pertaining to employee reactions during the implementation process. Simulations enhanced by exoskeletons promise to yield novel insights into physical loads, thereby facilitating the optimisation of technological processes.</p><p>VR and AR systems have the capacity to monitor the technical condition and correct use of PPE and CPE. For instance, sensors integrated into AR helmets or glasses can monitor the integrity of the helmet, the level of wear of protective gloves, or the correct fastening of safety harnesses. The transmission of this data to a control centre in real time facilitates the expeditious implementation of remedial measures in the event of any irregularities. In the context of CPE, AR can display information on the technical condition of scaffolding, excavation safety measures or ventilation systems, facilitating ongoing inspection and maintenance. The integration of VR and AR has the potential to facilitate the development of more ergonomic and functional PPE. Smart helmets, equipped with integrated augmented reality displays, serve as a prime example of this technological integration. These helmets eliminate the necessity for workers to carry additional devices, such as tablets, thereby reducing their physical and psychological workload. In the future, there is the potential for the integration of equipment with active properties and sensors with VR and AR technology, thereby enabling the dynamic adjustment of protection levels to changing conditions. Furthermore, the integration of VR and AR with PPE and CPE holds considerable potential in the domain of simulation testing of protective equipment and digital assessment of the suitability of protective equipment through integrated training scenarios.</p><p>Exoskeletons that function in conjunction with PPE and CPE have the capacity to mitigate the risk of injuries related to overload, in addition to providing support and monitoring worker overload. The reduction in operator fatigue enables prolonged work without a decline in concentration and precision, which results in enhanced task performance. The integration of exoskeletons with protective equipment such as helmets, goggles, ear muffs, gloves and protective footwear is a potential avenue for enhancing ergonomic support and safety.</p><p>The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and inspection robots, due to their mobility and capacity for real-time data collection, facilitates the inspection and monitoring of inaccessible areas. In a similar manner, sensors have the capacity to collect data in real time, which is subsequently transmitted to the operator for analysis. The application of UAVs and inspection robots, in conjunction with data from sensors, facilitates the acquisition of data (e.g., images, scans, measurement data) for the creation of realistic 3D environments and accident reconstructions, which are then displayed in VR. The utilisation of a combination of augmented reality, virtual reality (VR) unmanned aerial vehicles and inspection robots or sensors enables operators to observe the environment from the perspective of a UAV or robot in real time [<xref rid="B110-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. To illustrate this point, during the inspection of a mine wall, a UAVs equipped with a camera transmits images to the operator&#8217;s virtual reality goggles. The operator, situated within a secure control centre, is able to meticulously examine the structure of the wall, thereby identifying cracks, landslides, and other potential hazards. In the field of construction, the employment of UAVs has been instrumental in facilitating the monitoring of progress in elevated areas or in locations that are otherwise challenging to access, such as bridges and chimneys. In addition, the integration of augmented reality with unmanned aerial vehicles and inspection robots or sensors enables remote control of devices, thereby increasing the efficiency of inspection work. Employees have the capacity to operate robots utilising augmented reality interfaces, thereby enabling them to execute tasks with precision in challenging or hazardous environments. The utilisation of unmanned aerial vehicles in conjunction with robotic systems and sensors facilitates the acquisition of data, which can then be instantaneously exhibited within a virtual workspace. This capability enables expedited decision-making processes in instances where issues emerge. The amalgamation of these technologies with artificial intelligence facilitates real-time analysis of the collected data. The utilisation of artificial intelligence in the identification of patterns and potential hazards has become a subject of increasing importance in the field of accident prevention. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with VR and AR facilitates the personalisation of VR and AR scenarios to user requirements, the analysis of VR and AR technology users&#8217; behaviour and reactions, and the subsequent risk assessment based on these analyses.</p><p>The potential for increased safety in mining and construction through the integration of modern personal and collective protective equipment with UAVs, inspection robots, the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors and artificial intelligence is a promising development. The employment of contemporary personal and collective protective equipment, in conjunction with UAVs or inspection robots, will facilitate real-time risk monitoring and evaluation. Conversely, sensors facilitate real-time monitoring and analysis of the working environment. The IoT technology has the capacity to facilitate continuous monitoring of employees&#8217; health. Sensors can be utilised to measure employees&#8217; vital signs, including body temperature, oxygen saturation, and other physiological indicators [<xref rid="B111-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. The results of these measurements can be tracked in real time and used to respond quickly to threats. This will serve to significantly reduce the risk of serious incidents in the workplace. The integration of innovative protective measures with AI systems and sensors has the potential to automate work condition monitoring processes. The integration of the Internet of Things with sensors, in conjunction with artificial intelligence, facilitates continuous monitoring of the working environment. In the event of dangerous conditions being detected, these systems have the capacity to automatically notify employees of the hazard and control evacuation procedures.</p><p>The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors with exoskeletons is of significant importance in ensuring ergonomic working conditions. These technologies facilitate the analysis of biomechanical data, health and fatigue monitoring during the use of exoskeletons, while providing physical and ergonomic support. Conversely, the integration of AI with exoskeletons facilitates enhanced functionality, promoting ergonomic interaction with the user and optimising movement mechanics. For instance, exoskeletons can be integrated with AI systems that continuously monitor the user&#8217;s posture and load, adjusting their range of motion to the individual needs and limitations of the worker. Such solutions have been shown to have the potential to significantly reduce the risk of strain injuries.</p><p>Recent studies confirm the effectiveness of combining different innovative technologies to improve occupational safety. For example, the integration of augmented reality with BIM and IoT enables real-time visualisation of sensor data directly on construction sites, which significantly improves situational awareness and supports faster decision-making regarding occupational safety [<xref rid="B112-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Similarly, artificial intelligence has been successfully integrated with personal protective equipment monitoring systems, where computer vision algorithms automatically detect the correct use of helmets, vests, or safety glasses, reducing the need for manual inspections and increasing compliance with safety procedures [<xref rid="B113-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>,<xref rid="B114-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. These examples illustrate that inter-technological integration can deliver tangible benefits in terms of efficiency, safety awareness and risk reduction in both mining and construction. Whereas recent studies in the mining sector confirm the benefits of integrating multiple innovative technologies to enhance safety and operational efficiency. For instance, Zhang [<xref rid="B115-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] and Dodoo et al. [<xref rid="B116-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] demonstrated that a safety monitoring system combining BIM, IoT and artificial intelligence significantly improved real-time hazard detection, decision support, and emergency response in smart mining environments. Moreover, Singh et al. [<xref rid="B117-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] and Rodriguez et al. [<xref rid="B118-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] demonstrated the integration of UAVs equipped with LiDAR and VR/AR technologies, enabling precise surface mapping and operations planning in open-pit mining &#8212; thereby improving situational awareness and operational safety. These examples illustrate the tangible advantages of technological integration in enhancing mining safety and facilitating proactive risk management.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2dot2-sensors-25-05717"><title>4.2.2. Limitations on the Use and Mixing of Modern Technologies</title><p>The application and integration of technological solutions are subject to inherent limitations. A primary challenge confronting the industry is the substantial financial outlay required for investment, in addition to the ongoing costs of maintenance and servicing. A significant proportion of the technologies utilised necessitate periodic servicing and calibration, a factor that has been demonstrated to exert a substantial influence on the cost-effectiveness of technology implementation. Moreover, in numerous instances, the cost-effectiveness of investing in contemporary technologies is constrained by protracted return on investment cycles and an absence of comprehensive comprehension regarding the advantages of such solutions. Therefore, a financial assessment of the implementation becomes important.</p><p>Employee opposition to the implementation and utilisation of contemporary technologies has the potential to engender resistance from employees who harbour concerns regarding the discomfort associated with the wearing of equipment or the lack of confidence in novel solutions. However, the reluctance of employees to embrace technology, coupled with concerns regarding privacy, has the potential to impede the integration of contemporary systems [<xref rid="B119-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. The successful implementation of modern technologies frequently necessitates alterations in the organisational culture of a company. It is imperative to establish an environment that is receptive to innovation and fosters continuous enhancement and learning. A paucity of management commitment, inadequate communication with employees, or insufficient integration of new technologies into existing work processes can result in the marginalisation or inefficient use of these technologies. The transition from a reactive to a proactive approach to safety is a pivotal factor in achieving successful technology implementation.</p><p>Another significant limitation to the use of equipment (modern protective measures, exoskeletons) may be the size and weight of these technological solutions. The equipment can be heavy and bulky, which can restrict the employee&#8217;s freedom of movement, cause discomfort and even fatigue, paradoxically increasing the risk of accidents. Moreover, the aggregation of data concerning employee movements, activities and performance through the utilisation of contemporary technologies gives rise to questions and concerns regarding privacy and the potential utilisation of this data for excessive control. It is also important to note that the collection and analysis of user data, including intensive monitoring of employees, may result in legal and ethical issues. It is imperative to acknowledge these issues, as failure to do so may result in the erosion of employee trust and the exposure of companies to potential legal challenges. Consequently, when implementing innovative technologies (e.g., physiological monitoring technologies), employers must take ethical and privacy issues into account. It is imperative that these aspects are regulated in accordance with the prevailing legislation, whilst ensuring the protection of the interests of both parties. Additionally, systems that collect information from multiple sources are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which can have serious consequences. It is therefore essential to develop effective strategies to protect these systems from potential threats.</p><p>Despite their dynamic development, many technologies are still evolving and may have technical limitations in specific mining or construction conditions. Therefore, another significant aspect impacting the usability of contemporary technologies is their resistance to the environmental conditions in which they are employed. Electronic equipment is particularly vulnerable to critical conditions (moisture, dust, vibrations, extreme temperatures) that are prevalent in the mining and construction industries. In the field of construction, the most significant challenges are often associated with inclement weather conditions, such as strong winds and variable temperatures. In the field of mining, however, environmental factors differ significantly from those encountered in construction. Consequently, technological adaptation must be meticulously tailored to these distinct factors and industry requirements. In the context of mining operations, the most significant challenges encountered by professionals include elevated temperatures, humidity, dust, vibrations, natural shocks, and inadequate communication. It is imperative to acknowledge that the environmental conditions associated with underground and opencast mining will diverge. The selection of technology must be made with consideration for the environmental conditions in which it will be employed.</p><p>The necessity to equip personnel with the requisite competencies to utilise contemporary tools represents a further constraint on the integration of modern technologies. Research has demonstrated that a paucity of training can engender feelings of anxiety and uncertainty, which can have a detrimental effect on the utilisation of technology [<xref rid="B120-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Technologies should be designed with ease of use in mind to minimise stress associated with new tools and increase employee engagement [<xref rid="B121-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>].</p><p>Despite the significant potential of inter-technological integration, recent studies highlight serious barriers and limitations to combining innovative solutions in construction and mining. Research shows that exoskeletons may interfere with fall protection harnesses and other PPE, making their joint use problematic in practice [<xref rid="B122-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Moreover, while exoskeletons can reduce physical strain, they often increase cognitive workload by up to 33%, which can offset ergonomic benefits and raise the risk of errors [<xref rid="B74-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Similar compatibility challenges have been reported in the integration of AR/VR with safety requirements: field tests of HoloLens indicated that the device did not meet safety standards for protective eyewear, while misalignment artefacts reduced the reliability of quality control tasks [<xref rid="B21-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Other studies underline the discomfort and cybersickness associated with intensive VR training in mining, limiting its applicability in extended safety programmes [<xref rid="B22-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Finally, the simultaneous use of multiple PPE elements, such as helmets, respirators, and protective glasses, has been shown to reduce visibility and comfort, which complicates integration with AR headsets or wearable monitoring systems [<xref rid="B123-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. These findings indicate that although integration of emerging technologies is promising, their practical application requires careful testing, adaptation to harsh working environments, and the development of standards to ensure both safety and usability.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2dot3-sensors-25-05717"><title>4.2.3. Practical Ways to Reduce the Risks on the Use and Mixing of Modern Technologies</title><p>Although the integration of augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), personal and collective protective equipment (PPE/CPE), and exoskeletons offers clear benefits for safety in mining and construction, their combined application also brings several risks, which can be mitigated through practical measures. First, ensuring compatibility with existing PPE standards is essential, as studies have reported frequent conflicts between exoskeleton straps or AR headsets and conventional protective equipment, especially fall-arrest harnesses and helmets [<xref rid="B21-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B122-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Manufacturers should therefore adopt integrated design approaches and test new systems for interoperability before large-scale deployment. Second, managing cognitive and physical load is crucial, since exoskeletons and AR/VR may reduce biomechanical strain but simultaneously increase mental effort, thereby affecting situational awareness [<xref rid="B124-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>,<xref rid="B125-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Adaptive systems that filter information and adjust exoskeleton support to the worker&#8217;s state can help balance these effects. Third, discomfort and user acceptance remain major obstacles, as prolonged VR exposure may cause cybersickness and resistance to new technologies in training or operations; gradual implementation and participatory design, where end-users contribute to system adjustments, are effective ways to improve usability [<xref rid="B22-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Fourth, ethical and legal safeguards are required because AR/VR and wearable technologies collect sensitive data, making compliance with GDPR and clear regulations on liability in case of malfunctions necessary [<xref rid="B123-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Finally, continuous evaluation and feedback loops through pilot programmes, safety audits, and structured reporting from workers are key to iteratively improving systems and preventing unintended risks [<xref rid="B15-sensors-25-05717" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Together, these measures demonstrate that while integration of modern technologies is challenging, their risks can be substantially reduced through proactive technical, organisational, and legal interventions supported by continuous worker engagement.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-sensors-25-05717"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Modern technological developments have been found to have a significant impact on improving occupational safety in sectors characterised by a high level of occupational risk, such as mining and construction. Employees in these industries are particularly vulnerable to the occurrence of occupational accidents and the long-term impact of harmful environmental factors. Consequently, the implementation of innovative technological solutions is becoming a pivotal component of preventive strategies to protect the health and lives of workers.</p><p>Innovative technologies in mining and construction have been identified as key elements in the development of more effective occupational safety management strategies. The integration of automation, digitisation, data analysis and intelligent monitoring systems establishes a cohesive system that responds to risks and actively prevents them. In the face of mounting legal, social and economic pressures, investment in technological innovation has emerged not only as a manifestation of concern for workers, but also as a prerequisite for the sustainable development of these key industries.</p><p>In consideration of the analyses that have been conducted, it can be concluded that modern technologies, including but not limited to virtual and augmented reality, unmanned aerial vehicles, inspection robots, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and exoskeletons, offer significant potential for improving occupational safety in high-risk industries, particularly in the construction and mining sectors. These technologies facilitate not only realistic training and precise inspections, but also real-time monitoring of the work environment and physical support for employees. Nevertheless, significant challenges persist, encompassing concerns regarding reliability, interoperability, cybersecurity, and employee acceptance and training. The integration of these technologies into cohesive safety management systems has the potential to result in a substantial reduction in workplace accidents.</p><p>Further research should include the development of existing technologies and the exploration of new and more effective solutions. Effective implementation also requires further interdisciplinary research, including social, legal, and ethical aspects, to fully harness the opportunities offered by the digital transformation of work environments.</p><p>This two-part study has shown that innovative technologies in mining and construction should be understood not only as novel solutions, but as tools that bring measurable safety, social, and economic benefits through effective implementation. By jointly analysing these two high-risk sectors, it has been demonstrated that, despite their specific conditions, both industries face comparable challenges and can benefit from transferable practices and synergies. Positive examples of technological integration, such as AR with BIM and IoT or AI-supported PPE monitoring, confirm tangible improvements in situational awareness and compliance, while identified limitations&#8212;including compatibility issues, cognitive load, cybersickness, and ethical dilemmas&#8212;highlight the need for careful adaptation. Practical recommendations such as modular PPE design, adaptive information filtering, and structured user feedback may reduce these risks, paving the way for broader adoption. Finally, future research should focus on the convergence of VR/AR with IoT and Big Data, as well as on emerging areas such as blockchain and 6G, accompanied by the development of robust ethical and legal frameworks to safeguard workers&#8217; rights and data privacy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
