However, limited information is available on the fluctuation of quality attributes (QAs), during manufacturing using the HEK293 suspension cell line system, which is suitable for small- to large-scale production using bioreactors. In this study, we evaluated 14 QAs and their variations, including the viral protein (VP) stoichiometric ratio and deamidation ratios of asparagine residues, of the products for AAV8 with enhanced green fluorescent protein as a gene of interest, which were produced employing essentially the same production procedures with slight modification in the upstream conditions. The VP stoichiometric ratios of the manufactured adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors differed significantly among the products. Correlation analysis of the QAs revealed the attributes that could affect the transduction efficiency. Notably, the VP2 stoichiometric ratio was positively correlated with the transduction efficiency. The deamidation ratios of N57 and N94 in VP1 had a negative tendency to the transduction efficiency. Consistently, the accelerated stability testing showed a negative correlation of the time-dependent increase in the deamidation ratios of the two asparagine residues with the transduction efficiency.

This could lead to significant variations in patient outcomes caused by the relationship between the capsid particle dose and immune response. In one study, mice were treated with AAV8 encoding the factor IX gene as a gene of interest (GOI) and its empty by-product.

The products were then purified through the same purification procedure and evaluated for variations in QAs. Fourteen QAs of all products were examined, including particle properties, particle size distribution, viral protein properties, impurities, and transduction efficiency. Correlation analysis of acquired QAs was then performed.

In DoE, it is essential to know which QA can be a CQA for the establishment of a design space for CPPs (critical process parameters) (e.g., temperature, pH, stirring speed, and material concentration). In this study, we were able to conclude that at least the VP2 stoichiometric ratio and the deamidation ratios of N57 and N94 will be able to be used in the identification and the determination of the range of CPPs.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec4.21"><title>Chemical reagents</title><p id="p0196">Poloxamer 188 powder (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) was used to prepare all Poloxamer 188 solutions at varying concentrations as required for each experiment.
