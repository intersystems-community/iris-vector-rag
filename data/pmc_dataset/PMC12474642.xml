Here, we investigate the impact of chronic SS exposure on bone tissue and the underlying mechanisms. Using a mouse model, we demonstrate that prolonged SS exposure induces significant bone loss, which correlates with alterations in ferroptosis-related markers. In vitro, SS exposure activates ferroptosis, which is characterized by elevated reactive oxygen species levels and impaired osteogenic differentiation in MC3T3 cells. Notably, melatonin, a potent endogenous antioxidant, mitigates SS-induced oxidative stress, inhibits ferroptosis, restores osteoblast function, and alleviates bone loss in mice. These findings highlight ferroptosis as a critical contributor to SS-induced osteoporosis and identify melatonin as a promising therapeutic agent for its prevention and treatment.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10495-025-02135-8.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sodium sulfite</kwd><kwd>Osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>Ferroptosis</kwd><kwd>Melatonin</kwd><kwd>MC3T3</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>82401552</award-id><award-id>82472431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Tengbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>ZR2024QH590</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Tengbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Shandong Province Major Scientific and Technical Innovation Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>2021SFGC0502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Tengbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Qingdao Science and Technology Benefit People Demonstration Guide Special Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>22-3-7-smjk-5-nsh</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Tengbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Sodium sulfite (SS) is a widely utilized food additive approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for its antimicrobial properties, effectively inhibiting the growth of molds, yeasts, and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Upon ingestion, SS is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and distributed to various tissues, including the liver and bones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition to dietary exposure, SS is endogenously produced during the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids and certain drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite its widespread use, excessive exposure to SS has been implicated in adverse health effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], including hepatocyte apoptosis, mast cell damage, and hypersensitivity reactions, such as asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

The micro-CT results showed that SS had reduced bone mass in a dose-dependent manner compared with controls (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Analysis of bone morphometric parameters showed that BV/TV and Tb.N decreased and Tb.Sp increased in the distal femur of mice.Tb.th decreased in the group exposed to the low-dose SS, but the decrease was not statistically significant and showed a significant decrease in the group exposed to the high-dose SS (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). We suspected that it might be that the thinner bone trabeculae were reduced first and the thicker ones had not yet changed, eventually leading to little change in thickness. HE staining result consistent with the above results. We were able to observe a decrease in the number of bone trabeculae and an increase in the separation rate (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). The above suggested that SS exposure can successfully model reduced bone mass in mice. Finally, we performed immunohistochemical staining of type I collagen (Col-1) to investigate the effect of SS on osteogenesis. The results showed that the number of osteoblasts expressing Col-1 was reduced after SS exposure, and the relative mean optical density value of Col-1 was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by SS (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E and FigSI. 1A). This suggests that prolonged SS exposure affects the osteogenic capacity of mice.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;1</label><caption><p>Sodium sulfite-induced bone loss in mice. <bold>A</bold> Patterns of sodium sulfite gavage for 40&#160;days in C57BL/6 mice (0, 8.6, and 17.2&#160;mg/kg). <bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold> Representative horizontal and sagittal cross-sectional images of the distal femur Micro-CT in mice with its region of interest (red box) and corresponding bone morphological parameters analysis (n&#8201;=&#8201;3). <bold>D</bold> Representative images of HE staining of the distal femur in control and mice exposed to different doses of SS (70&#215;, Scale bar, 400&#160;&#956;m, n&#8201;=&#8201;3). <bold>E</bold> Representative images of Col-1 IHC staining in control and SS-exposed mice (400&#215;, Scale bar, 100&#160;&#956;m, n&#8201;=&#8201;3).

When the concentration reached 2&#160;mM, the cell viability decreased significantly (FigSI. 1B). If the cells were treated with higher concentrations of SS, we could not collect enough cells for the experiment. Therefore, we chose to treat MC3T3 cells with 2&#160;mM SS for 24&#160;h for subsequent experiments. To understand whether the osteogenic differentiation capacity of MC3T3 was affected by SS exposure, we subjected cells with or without SS treatment for 24&#160;h to osteogenic differentiation induction. After 7 days, ALP staining and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis were performed. ARS staining was performed 21&#160;days after osteogenic induction. ALP and ARS staining results showed a decrease in the positive areas of staining in SS-treated cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, B). The qPCR results showed that the expression of osteogenesis-related genes (OCN, OPN, and COL1A2) in the SS treatment group cells was down-regulated (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). The above results suggested that SS stimulation impaired the osteogenic capacity of MC3T3. The results showed that in agreement with the in vivo experiments, SS exposure impaired the osteogenic capacity of MC3T3 cells. To further explore the molecular mechanisms by which SS induces MC3T3 cell death and reduced osteogenic capacity, we performed RNA sequencing to identify differential genes in SS-exposed and control groups. A schematic diagram of the transcriptome sequencing preparation is shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D.

The results showed that the mRNA content of ferroptosis-related genes, including Slc7A11, FTH1, and GPX4 was reduced (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Therefore, we hypothesized that SS might induce ferroptosis in MC3T3 cells. Ferroptosis is generally accompanied by a series of changes, increased Fe<sup>2+</sup> content, reactive oxygen species production, and lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To further confirm the occurrence of ferroptosis, we performed C11-BODIPY staining, DCFH-DA staining, and FerroOrange staining in MC3T3 with or without SS exposure. In the SS-exposed group, C11-BODIPY produced bright green fluorescence, indicating lipid peroxidation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C and FigSI. 1C); DCFH-DA staining showed increased bright green fluorescence; the fluorescence intensity of the FerroOrange probe surged (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D and FigSI. 1D, E). Finally, the results of the Western Blot assay for Slc7A11, FTH1, and GPX4 were consistent with the previous results. Those were, the expression of these three proteins decreased under SS stimulation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E and FigSI. 1F). It indicated that SS was able to activate MC3T3 cells to undergo ferroptosis.

WB detected the protein levels of Slc7A11, FTH1, and GPX4. The results showed that exposure to SS inhibited the protein expression of Slc7A11, FTH1, and GPX4, and the degree of decrease was positively correlated with the dose of SS (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, B). This is consistent with the sequencing results of the cells, suggesting that exposure to SS activates ferroptosis. We then further analyzed the serum levels of GSH and MDA in mice and found that exposure to SS decreased GSH levels but increased MDA levels (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Immunohistochemistry for GPX4 showed a reduction in positive areas for GPX4 in the low- and high-dose SS exposure groups compared to the control group (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D).

We divided the cells into three groups: (1) control group; (2) SS group; and (3) SS&#8201;+&#8201;MT group. Western Blot results showed that MT partially restored the low expression levels of GPX4, Slc7A11, and FTH1 caused by SS stimulation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, B). Therefore, we speculated that MT could attenuate SS exposure-induced ferroptosis in osteoblasts. To further prove this speculation, we performed C11-BODIPY staining, DCFH-DA staining, and FerroOrange staining on three groups of cells. Consistent with the WB results, MT significantly improved the SS stimulation-induced changes in MC3T3 cell-associated probe staining (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C, D and FigSI. 2A, B, C). Based on the above information, we speculated that MT could ameliorate the decreased osteogenic capacity of MC3T3 cells by inhibiting ferroptosis. Subsequently, ALP and ARS staining was performed on the three groups of cells, and the results showed that the ALP and ARS staining area was larger in the MT-treated group than in the SS group, which implied that MT could improve the osteogenic capacity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E). For further verification, we detected the levels of OCN, OPN, and COL1A2 mRNA in MC3T3 cells by RT-PCR. Compared with SS stimulation alone, pretreatment with MT up-regulated OCN and COL1A2 gene expression levels, and OPN was also up-regulated but without significant difference (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F).

The mice were categorized into three distinct groups: (1) control group; (2) SS group (SS 17.2&#160;mg/kg); and (3) SS&#8201;+&#8201;MT group (SS 17.2&#160;mg/kg, MT 50&#160;mg/kg). The mice were anesthetized and euthanized 40&#160;days following the administration of SS, after which the tissues were collected for subsequent experiments (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). Micro-CT analysis revealed that the SS-treated mice exhibited reduced bone volume, fewer trabecular structures, decreased thickness, and elevated separation rates compared to both the control and MT treatment groups. These findings were statistically significant, with the bone microstructural parameters of the MT-treated group falling between those of the control and SS groups (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B, C). Histological examination via HE staining corroborated these results, demonstrating smaller spacing between bone trabeculae in the MT-treated group relative to the SS group (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D). We sought to determine whether MT could also enhance osteogenesis in vivo. IHC staining revealed an increase in Col-1-positive cells post-MT treatment, indicating a rise in Col-1-expressing osteoblasts within treated mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E and FigSI. 2D). We concluded that MT mitigated bone loss in mice to some extent. To further investigate whether the inhibitory effect of MT on SS-induced bone loss in mice is related to ferroptosis, we examined the serum levels of GSH and MDA and carried out Western Blot and IHC experiments. Our results demonstrated that MT significantly upregulated GSH levels while reducing MDA levels when compared to SS group (FigSI. 2E, F). WB results indicated an increase in protein expression levels of GPX4, SLC7A11, and FTH1 in the MT-treated group compared to the SS group (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F, G). IHC staining for GPX4 aligned with these protein expression findings following SS stimulation; specifically, there was a decrease in relative mean optical density values for GPX4 that was partially restored by MT treatment.

Using in vivo and in vitro models, we demonstrate that sodium sulfite disrupts bone homeostasis by impairing osteoblast function through the ferroptosis pathway, a novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Furthermore, we show that melatonin, a potent antioxidant and iron chelator, effectively mitigates these adverse effects, restoresbone mass and osteogenic capacity by inhibiting ferroptosis.</p><p id="Par30">Sodium sulfite, widely used as a food additive, has been associated with various adverse health effects, particularly with chronic or excessive consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Despite its widespread use, its potential impact on bone health has been underexplored to date. Here, we established a murine model of sodium sulfite-induced osteoporosis through prolonged gavage and corroborated these findings with cellular models of osteogenesis. RNA sequencing and subsequent biochemical analyses revealed that SS exposure significantly activates ferroptosis-related pathways, including decreased expression of GPX4, SLC7A11, and FTH1, along with increases oxidative stress markers.

Our findings extend this paradigm by identifying ferroptosis as a critical contributor to sodium sulfite-induced osteoporosis.
