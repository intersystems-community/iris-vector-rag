Disparities in immune function may be influenced by metabolic and inflammatory mechanisms. Methods: The current study investigated humoral immune responses to influenza vaccination in a diverse cohort of Hispanic individuals from South Florida, encompassing both White and Black Hispanics. Antibody responses were assessed post-vaccination, and B cell phenotypes were analyzed to evaluate inflammatory and metabolic characteristics. In vitro experiments were conducted to determine whether blocking metabolic pathways could alter the inflammatory phenotype of B cells. Data were analyzed using an unpaired Student&#8217;s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test (two-tailed), and correlation analysis was conducted with Pearson correlation. Results: Our findings indicated that Black Hispanic individuals exhibited significantly reduced antibody responses compared to White Hispanics (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) following influenza vaccination. This diminished humoral response correlated with inversely with serum LDH (r = &#8722;0.58; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.0005) and other intrinsic inflammatory phenotypes in blood-derived B cells and was supported by changes in metabolic activity. In vitro blockade of metabolic pathways effectively reduced the inflammatory phenotype of B cells from Black Hispanic individuals, suggesting a mechanistic link between metabolic dysfunction and impaired vaccine-induced immunity. Conclusion: This study is the first to reveal racial disparities in influenza vaccine responses within a Hispanic population, highlighting reduced antibody production in Black Hispanics. These findings suggest that metabolically driven B cell inflammation may play a critical role and point to potential therapeutic strategies to address disparities in vaccine-induced immunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>health disparities</kwd><kwd>humoral immunity</kwd><kwd>influenza vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>NIH</funding-source><award-id>AG086071</award-id><award-id>AG059719</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by NIH award AG086071 (D.F./S.P.) and AG059719 (D.F.).</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-13-00938"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Immunity and its impact on racial and ethnic health disparities is a complex and multifactorial issue, influenced by various factors that affect immune cell function and health outcomes among diverse groups [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Equitable immunization strategies not only help to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases but also promote overall health by encouraging people, including marginalized groups, to engage with healthcare, thereby addressing other health inequalities [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Racial and ethnic minorities frequently often experience chronic stress stemming from systemic racism, discrimination, and socioeconomic challenges, which can dysregulate immune function. This immune dysregulation may lead to increased inflammation and a reduced ability to respond effectively to infections and vaccinations [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In the United States, ethnic minority populations experience disproportionately higher rates of infectious diseases, often due to barriers in accessing healthcare, testing and treatment [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, variations in immune responses among these groups warrant further investigation, as they may significantly contribute to health disparities [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Minority populations may also experience accelerated immunosenescence and increased low-grade systemic inflammation, known as inflammaging [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], leading to an earlier onset of age-related diseases. Emerging evidence indicates racial and ethnic disparities in vaccine responses, with notable differences in antibody production and T cell activation following vaccination [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Historically, racial and ethnic minorities have been underrepresented in clinical trials, limiting our understanding of immune responses in diverse populations [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, it is imperative to employ ethical and community-focused immunology research to address these disparities in immune function.</p><p>In 2020, approximately 6 million Afro-Latino adults resided in the United States, constituting about 2% of the adult population and 12% of the adult Latino population [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Afro-Latinos or Black Hispanics are often categorized alongside non-Hispanic Black populations in research studies, while White Hispanics are classified with non-Hispanic Whites [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This grouping may obscure significant differences between these demographic groups. Recent studies indicate that the immune systems of Black Hispanics and White Hispanics may exhibit significant variations due to factors such as genetic ancestry, environmental exposures, social determinants of health, and access to healthcare [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Black Hispanics generally possess higher levels of African ancestry, which are associated with genetic variations that affect cytokine production and inflammatory responses. Additionally, they face an increased risk of conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, all linked to chronic low-grade inflammation and compromised immune function [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, both Black and White Hispanics were disproportionately affected compared to non-Hispanic Whites; however, Black Hispanics experienced higher rates of hospitalization and mortality [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Our research has previously identified and characterized critical defects in the antibody response to the influenza vaccine among healthy individuals of different ages [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], as well as in those with inflammatory conditions and diseases [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We have shown that intrinsic defects in immune cell function lead to decreased specific responses to the vaccine. Additionally, we have demonstrated that inflammaging is marked by increased frequencies of pro-inflammatory cell subsets, which are characterized by higher levels of transcripts for pro-inflammatory and senescence-associated markers, and they are hyper-metabolic. This hyper-metabolic status is essential for supporting intrinsic inflammation and immune activation (IA) [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>This study aims to determine whether influenza vaccine-induced antibody responses differ between White and Black Hispanic individuals in South Florida. We further investigated whether intrinsic inflammatory and metabolic phenotypes of blood-derived B cells contribute to these racial disparities in vaccine responses. Finally, we tested whether in vitro inhibition of metabolic pathways could attenuate the inflammatory phenotype of B cells from Black Hispanic individuals, thereby providing mechanistic insight into immune dysfunction and identifying potential avenues for intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-13-00938"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects" id="sec2dot1-vaccines-13-00938"><title>2.1. Study Participants</title><p>This study used deidentified samples from a prior influenza vaccination study conducted at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (UM-MSOM). Study recruitment took place before the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and the study protocol was approved by the UM-MSOM Institutional Review Board (IRB, protocols #20070481 and #20160542). Participants were recruited after providing signed informed consent. Individuals with metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases, T2DM, cardiovascular diseases, chronic infectious diseases (HIV, malaria), and active malignancies were excluded from the study. Additionally, participants with substance abuse or alcohol abuse issues, those undergoing hormonal replacement therapy, and individuals on immunosuppressant medications or steroids were also excluded. This study included deidentified samples from Hispanic participants who self-identified as White (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 20, age range 42&#8211;55 years) or Black (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12, age range 44&#8211;53 years). Within each group, participants were evenly split between females and males.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-vaccines-13-00938"><title>2.2. Influenza Vaccination and Sample Collection</title><p>All individuals received the seasonal Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine, which included the strains A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/Victoria/361/2011, and B/Massachusetts/2/2012. They had been vaccinated annually since the 2009&#8211;2010 influenza season. Blood samples were collected before vaccination and four weeks (day 28) after vaccination. At enrollment, all participants were free of influenza and respiratory tract infection symptoms, and they did not experience influenza-like symptoms during a six-month follow-up. Blood was collected in Vacutainer CPT tubes, and serum was extracted and cryopreserved at &#8722;80 &#176;C. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated through gradient centrifugation, cryopreserved, and stored at &#8722;146 &#176;C. All the cellular immunology assays were performed using PBMC collected before vaccination. On the day of the experiment, PBMC were thawed, and cell viability was assessed using trypan blue counting. PBMC with less than 75% viability were discarded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-vaccines-13-00938"><title>2.3. Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) Assay</title><p>The serum response to the influenza vaccine was assessed using the Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) assay, a key indicator of vaccine effectiveness [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This assay measures the ability of specific viruses or their components to cause hemagglutination in red blood cells. Antibodies in serum samples specific to influenza antigens can inhibit this agglutination. To evaluate antibody production in response to the vaccine, paired pre- and day 28 post-vaccination serum samples from the same individual were tested. Serum-inhibiting titers of 1:40 or higher indicate seroprotection against infection. A four-fold increase in titer after vaccination signifies a positive response to the vaccine [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-vaccines-13-00938"><title>2.4.

Anaerobic glycolysis and lactate secretion are crucial for the release of markers associated with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) [<xref rid="B27-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These processes, along with cell and endoplasmic reticulum enlargement, occur with NF-kB signaling and activation, leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and pathogenic antibodies. We analyzed the RNA expression of metabolic and inflammatory markers in B cells isolated from the peripheral blood of Black and White Hispanic individuals using qPCR. We measured the expression of Glut1, the primary glucose transporter in human circulating B cells; LDHA, which converts pyruvate into lactate; and PDHX, a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex that converts pyruvate into Acetyl CoA, linking glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the production of reactive oxygen species. Results in <xref rid="vaccines-13-00938-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> show a higher expression of metabolic transcripts in B cells from Black Hispanics compared to those from White Hispanics, particularly LDHA, consistent with the higher lactate secretion observed (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00938-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). Due to this increase in LDHA, we evaluated the expression of other markers associated with glucose metabolism and anaerobic glycolysis, such as HK1 and HK2, Hexokinase 1 and 2, that phosphorylate glucose, the initial step in glucose metabolism; Pyruvate kinase M1/2, PKM, that converts phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate, the final step in glycolysis; and LDHB, lactate dehydrogenase B, another isoform of lactate dehydrogenase expressed at lower levels in immune cells compared to LDHA.

Discussion</title><p>In this study, we identified novel mechanisms by which metabolic dysfunction amplifies immune cell defects and contributes to reduced production of protective antibodies following influenza vaccination in Black compared to White Hispanic individuals living in South Florida. To our knowledge, these findings are the first to demonstrate racially distinct humoral responses within a Hispanic population, with Black Hispanics exhibiting significantly lower post-vaccination antibody levels. This diminished antibody response was linked to an intrinsic pro-inflammatory phenotype in blood-derived B cells, supported by altered metabolic activity. These results underscore the importance of understanding immune differences between Black and White Hispanics, as such insights are critical for developing targeted strategies to improve vaccine responsiveness and overall health outcomes in this diverse and understudied group.</p><p>Our previously published findings have identified critical defects in the immunologic cascade related to specific antibody responses to the influenza vaccine in healthy individuals across different ages [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], as well as in those affected by obesity [<xref rid="B29-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], T2DM [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and chronic viral infections such as HIV [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. All these conditions are characterized by inflammaging and persistent IA, which contribute to dysfunctional immune cells and reduced immunity to infections and vaccines, as reviewed in [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Inflammaging is also associated with metabolic changes, including mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], decreased insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], increased nutrient uptake [<xref rid="B34-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and elevated blood levels of metabolites such as lactate which in turn support the secretion of inflammatory products and exacerbate inflammaging [<xref rid="B35-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Although seasonal influenza vaccination effectively reduces the burden of illness, transmission, hospitalizations, and death, vaccination rates have historically been lower among Black individuals compared to White individuals, despite a higher burden of illness in Black communities [<xref rid="B36-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Moreover, both immunogenicity and efficacy (production and duration) of vaccine-specific protective immunity appear to be diminished in minority populations facing health disparities, increasing their vulnerability to infection and its complications [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Different racial groups may also exhibit varying prevalence rates of metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and chronic inflammation, as well as disparities in nutritional status and microbiome diversity, all of which can impact immune responses to vaccines. Studies indicate that populations with African ancestry, including Black Hispanics, often show lower antibody titers after vaccination compared to those of European ancestry, such as White Hispanics [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B40-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, the underlying immune mechanisms remain unclear. Many Black individuals have lower vaccination rates compared to White individuals, a disparity influenced by factors such as healthcare access, insurance coverage, lack of accurate information about vaccine efficacy, and socio-economic status [<xref rid="B41-vaccines-13-00938" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, the immune response to the influenza vaccine in racially diverse Hispanics remains largely unknown.</p><p>Our study aims to identify metabolic pathways involved in regulating humoral immunity in racially diverse Hispanics, with the goal of developing innovative therapeutic interventions to enhance the response to the influenza vaccine in this vulnerable population. The role of the individual&#8217;s metabolic status, as well as the metabolic pathways/markers of B cells and their implications on antibody responses to influenza vaccination in racially diverse Hispanics is unknown. Our results herein show that in Black Hispanics, metabolic inflammation exacerbates B cell defects due to dysregulated metabolic reprogramming, primarily marked by increased anaerobic glycolysis and lactate secretion. B cells with a higher metabolic phenotype, as observed in Black Hispanics, are associated with higher intrinsic inflammation and a decreased ability to generate protective antibody responses. Our results further highlight the role of metabolic abnormalities of immune cells in Black Hispanics compromising their influenza vaccine effectiveness. We believe that the identification of metabolic factors that are correlated with vaccine responses and B cell function in racially diverse Hispanics will help to develop targeted interventions to enhance immune responses in racial health disparities among those who do not respond adequately to the influenza vaccine.</p><p>This study has several limitations. Its observational design prevents the establishment of causality between B cell metabolic reprogramming, inflammatory phenotypes, and reduced influenza vaccine responses in Black Hispanics. Although our in vitro experiments indicate that blocking metabolic pathways may decrease B cell inflammation, these results are preliminary and require confirmation through in vivo studies. Additionally, various confounding factors including socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, vaccination history, environmental exposures, nutrition, and unmeasured influences such as microbiome composition, chronic stress, and comorbid conditions may also affect immune responses. Furthermore, the modest sample size, although matched for age and sex, limits the generalizability of our findings to the wider Hispanic population. Future research should involve larger, multi-site cohorts with comprehensive sociodemographic and clinical data to validate these results and clarify the relative impacts of biological and social determinants, ultimately guiding interventions aimed at reducing disparities in vaccine-induced immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-13-00938"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a lower effect of influenza vaccination in Black Hispanic individuals, a minority population disproportionately affected by chronic diseases, resulting in a higher burden of influenza infection and increased rates of hospitalization and death. Yearly influenza vaccination is highly recommended for these individuals to boost specific antibody titers. Our results also suggest novel strategies for therapeutic interventions using metabolic modifiers to block pathways of B cell intrinsic inflammation and improve protective humoral immunity not only in Black Hispanics but also in other vulnerable populations with diminished vaccine responses</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Research reported in this publication was performed in part at the Flow Cytometry Shared Resource of the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami, which is supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under award number P30CA240139.
