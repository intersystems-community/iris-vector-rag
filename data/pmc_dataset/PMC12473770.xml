While previous studies have shown a relationship between spinal deformities and GERD symptoms, these findings have been largely observational, with few morphometric analyses. No prior study has directly quantified the relationship between thoracic curvature and hiatal surface area (HSA) using standardized computed tomography (CT)-based methods. Furthermore, existing studies have typically focused on patients with visible hernias, limiting understanding of early, subclinical anatomical changes. This study addresses this gap by evaluating whether thoracic kyphosis is associated with measurable hiatal enlargement, even in the absence of overt HH. Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, 100 adult patients (50 with thoracic kyphosis, defined as a Cobb angle of &#8805;50&#176; and 50 age- and sex-matched controls) underwent multidetector CT (MDCT). Hiatal surface area (HSA) was measured on a standardized oblique axial plane aligned with the diaphragmatic crura. Correlation and multivariable regression analyses were performed to assess relationships between Cobb angle and HSA. Results: The kyphosis group showed significantly larger HSA than controls (5.14 &#177; 1.31 cm<sup>2</sup> vs. 3.59 &#177; 0.74 cm<sup>2</sup>; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). A moderate positive correlation was found between Cobb angle and HSA (r = 0.336, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.017). Multivariable analysis identified the Cobb angle as an independent predictor of HSA (&#946; = 0.028; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.017), while age and sex were not significant predictors. No overt herniation was present in any subject. Conclusions: This is the first CT-based morphometric study to demonstrate that thoracic kyphosis is associated with hiatal enlargement, even in the absence of overt herniation. These findings support the hypothesis that postural spinal deformities may predispose individuals to GERD by structurally remodeling the diaphragmatic hiatus.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>thoracic kyphosis</kwd><kwd>hiatal surface area</kwd><kwd>gastroesophageal reflux</kwd><kwd>computed tomography</kwd><kwd>diaphragmatic anatomy</kwd><kwd>Cobb angle</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This study received no financial support.

Introduction</title><p>Thoracic kyphosis refers to an excessive anterior&#8211;posterior curvature of the thoracic spine, most commonly assessed using the Cobb method on sagittal images. Although some degree of kyphosis is a regular part of the spine&#8217;s sagittal alignment&#8212;typically ranging between 20&#176; and 40&#176;&#8212;a marked increase beyond this range may result in structural and functional consequences [<xref rid="B1-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The kyphotic curve may progress due to a range of etiological factors, including trauma, congenital vertebral anomalies, Scheuermann disease, infections, degenerative disc disease, and post-surgical iatrogenic changes [<xref rid="B1-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Importantly, thoracic kyphosis tends to increase with age and can be more pronounced in females during specific growth periods, though it is overall more prevalent in males [<xref rid="B1-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition to age-related structural changes, thoracic kyphosis may also be influenced by sex-specific differences in muscle strength and postural control. In a study focusing on adults aged 35&#8211;45, women were found to exhibit significantly greater thoracic curvature than men, reflecting biomechanical and neuromuscular differences between sexes [<xref rid="B2-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Kyphosis, particularly in the context of osteoporotic vertebral fractures, has been increasingly recognized as a contributor to altered intra-abdominal dynamics, potentially predisposing individuals to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hiatal hernia. This association is particularly evident in patients with lumbar kyphosis, where deformity-related increases in intra-abdominal pressure may exert mechanical stress on the gastroesophageal junction [<xref rid="B3-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The herniation of gastric contents characterizes hiatal hernia (HH) through the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm and is a well-established anatomical contributor to GERD. The biomechanical interplay between thoracic spinal curvature and abdominal pressure gradients is hypothesized to cause expansion of the hiatus, facilitating upward migration of the stomach [<xref rid="B4-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This hypothesis gains support from several studies associating spinal deformities such as kyphosis and scoliosis with increased prevalence of HH and reflux symptoms [<xref rid="B6-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Sagittal reconstructed MDCT images enable the measurement of thoracic kyphosis by providing a clear visualization of vertebral alignment from T1 to T12. This method provides a noninvasive and practical approach to assessing spinal curvature in preoperative evaluations [<xref rid="B8-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, MDCT provides accurate quantification of the hiatal surface area and esophageal hiatus diameters, including anterior&#8211;posterior and transverse dimensions, which are valuable in the preoperative evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux disease and hiatal hernia [<xref rid="B9-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In a key study, Karatay et al. [<xref rid="B9-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] utilized MDCT to evaluate the HSA and esophageal hiatus diameters, reporting significantly increased values in patients with GERD compared to controls. Their findings validated CT as a diagnostic tool and established a morphometric basis for the link between anatomical deformation and functional impairment. This perspective is further supported by Ouyang et al. [<xref rid="B10-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], who introduced a standardized method for in vivo quantification of the esophageal hiatus using double-oblique multiplanar reconstructed MDCT images. They demonstrated that HSA was significantly larger in patients with HH, particularly those with type III hernias, and also correlated with the presence of GERD. These results reinforce the clinical relevance of anatomical assessment in understanding reflux pathophysiology and highlight the potential of MDCT-based measurements to guide preoperative planning in antireflux surgery [<xref rid="B10-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Vertebral deformities such as thoracic kyphosis and degenerative scoliosis have been shown to alter intra-abdominal dynamics and diaphragmatic tension, contributing to the pathogenesis of GERD and hiatal hernia. Kusano et al. demonstrated a significant correlation between the severity of kyphosis and the grade of hiatal hernia in older women, suggesting that kyphotic angulation may stretch the esophagus cranially and widen the diaphragmatic hiatus independent of obesity [<xref rid="B5-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similarly, Hosogane et al. identified a strong association between left convex lumbar scoliosis and GERD symptoms, hypothesizing that spinal curvature near the diaphragm may distort the esophageal hiatus and increase intra-abdominal pressure [<xref rid="B7-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Batirel et al. further emphasized that even small increases in intra-abdominal pressure can overcome reduced lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure in the setting of a large esophageal hiatus, especially in individuals with compromised crural support, leading to increased acid reflux and esophagitis [<xref rid="B11-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These findings suggest that spinal deformities may create a biomechanical environment that favors the development of hiatal hernia and GERD, particularly in elderly populations.</p><p>Building on these observations, we hypothesize that increased thoracic kyphosis may be associated with measurable changes in the morphology of the esophageal hiatus, particularly an increase in hiatal surface area (HSA), which may predispose patients to GERD and HH. Despite the established roles of spinal deformity and hiatus dilation in reflux pathophysiology, this interaction remains underexplored with direct morphometric methods, and no prior study has directly evaluated the anatomical relationship between thoracic kyphosis and hiatus morphology using quantitative imaging. By exploring this association through sagittally reconstructed MDCT, this study aims to provide novel insights into the mechanical impact of thoracic curvature on the diaphragmatic hiatus. Understanding this relationship may enhance preoperative risk stratification, aid in the early identification of anatomical susceptibility to GERD, and ultimately contribute to more personalized and anatomy-informed surgical planning in affected populations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-tomography-11-00098"><title>2.

The image was realigned to bisect the midline of the vertebral bodies in the sagittal view and to run parallel to the anterior vertebral surfaces in the coronal view.

To assess consistency across patients, the tilt angle (sagittal deviation) and spin angle (coronal deviation) were recorded for each subject (<xref rid="tomography-11-00098-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Hiatal surface area (HSA) was quantified on this standardized plane using a freehand region-of-interest (ROI) tool. The inner margin of the esophageal hiatus&#8212;bounded by the crural limbs&#8212;was manually traced to enclose the whole cross-sectional opening. In cases where fat planes were indistinct, the anterior aortic contour or adjacent esophageal border was used as an anatomical reference. The workstation software automatically calculated the enclosed area in square centimeters. All reconstructions were reviewed using uniform soft-tissue window settings (width: 400 HU, level: 40 HU) to ensure consistency in soft-tissue contrast and anatomical margin delineation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-tomography-11-00098"><title>2.6.

Discussion</title><p>This study retrospectively investigated the effect of thoracic kyphosis on the hiatal surface area (HSA) using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), revealing a significantly larger HSA in the kyphotic group compared to the control group. A moderate positive correlation between the Cobb angle and HSA was observed, indicating that spinal deformity may structurally alter the diaphragmatic hiatus. Although the dataset originates from 2013, its scientific relevance persists and aligns closely with recent findings published between 2015 and 2025.</p><p>Several studies have emphasized the impact of kyphosis on intra-abdominal pressure and diaphragmatic displacement. Talarico and Vlahu [<xref rid="B14-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] demonstrated that spinal deformities, such as kyphoscoliosis, can anatomically stretch and widen the esophageal hiatus, facilitating intrathoracic stomach migration and the development of HH. Masaoka et al. [<xref rid="B15-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] demonstrated that enlargement of the anterior&#8211;posterior thoracic diameter&#8212;reflected by a decreased Haller Index&#8212;is associated with hiatal hernia in elderly patients, suggesting that thoracic deformity may play a structural role in hiatal widening. Building on these findings, Polomsky et al. [<xref rid="B4-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] provided further evidence by showing that patients with intrathoracic stomachs had significantly greater thoracic kyphosis&#8212;as measured by Cobb angle&#8212;and more vertebral fractures compared to age- and gender-matched controls. Their data indicated a mean Cobb angle of 50.2&#176; in patients with HH, significantly higher than the 39.7&#176; observed in controls (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), particularly among female patients. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that spinal curvature may not only distort diaphragmatic geometry but also contribute mechanically to the superior migration of abdominal viscera, reinforcing the role of thoracic biomechanics in the pathogenesis of HH. These previous insights are echoed in our current study, where we observed a significantly larger hiatal surface area (HSA) in patients with pronounced thoracic kyphosis (Cobb angle &#8805; 50&#176;) compared to the control group. More importantly, the moderate positive correlation identified between Cobb angle and HSA (r = 0.336, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.017) supports the notion that spinal curvature may not only distort the diaphragmatic architecture but also actively contribute to the superior displacement of abdominal contents. This direct morphometric evidence strengthens the hypothesis that thoracic kyphosis plays a biomechanical role in the pathogenesis of HH, bridging the anatomical observations of prior cadaveric and clinical studies with objective radiological data.</p><p>Karatay et al. [<xref rid="B9-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] demonstrated that computed tomography-based measurement of hiatal surface area (HSA) is a reliable method, reporting significantly larger HSA values in GERD patients compared to controls (median 19.11 cm<sup>2</sup> vs. 4.89 cm<sup>2</sup>; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and highlighting its utility in distinguishing hiatal hernia (HH) subtypes. Moten et al. [<xref rid="B16-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] validated a multiplanar MDCT technique for measuring HSA against intraoperative findings, demonstrating a strong correlation (r = 0.83; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and excellent intra- and inter-observer agreement (ICC = 0.97), confirming its reproducibility. Chan et al. [<xref rid="B17-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] further supported this approach, demonstrating that CT-HSA measurements not only significantly differentiated HH patients from matched controls (8.7 cm<sup>2</sup> vs. 2.2 cm<sup>2</sup>; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) but also yielded a sensitivity of 94.6% and an ICC of 1.00, outperforming traditional modalities such as endoscopy, barium swallow, and HRM. Similarly, Ouyang et al. [<xref rid="B10-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found that patients with HH had significantly larger HSA values (mean 6.9 cm<sup>2</sup>) compared to controls (2.5 cm<sup>2</sup>; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), with type III hernias showing the most significant enlargement. However, in patients without HH, HSA was not predictive of GERD (3.0 cm<sup>2</sup> vs. 2.5 cm<sup>2</sup>; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.12). Shi et al. [<xref rid="B18-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] extended these findings by demonstrating that, even in the absence of radiologically visible HH, increased oesophageal hiatus surface area (OHSA) measured via MDCT correlated positively with acid exposure time (r = 0.47; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) independent of lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Our study aligns substantially with these findings. We found that patients with thoracic kyphosis had significantly larger HSA values compared to controls (5.14 &#177; 1.31 cm<sup>2</sup> vs. 3.59 &#177; 0.74 cm<sup>2</sup>; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and Cobb angle correlated moderately with HSA (r = 0.336; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.017). By demonstrating this association in a morphologically intact population&#8212;excluding patients with visible hernias&#8212;our results support the growing evidence that HSA enlargement may represent a preclinical anatomical marker of GERD susceptibility. Although the explained variance was modest (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.113), the significance of the Cobb angle as an independent predictor highlights the anatomical influence of thoracic curvature, while also suggesting that additional biomechanical or physiological factors may contribute to HSA variation. Thus, CT-derived HSA should be recognized not only as a diagnostic endpoint but also as a sensitive and objective biomarker for early risk stratification in patients with posture-related anatomical alterations such as thoracic kyphosis. Given its reproducibility and predictive potential, CT-based HSA measurement may serve as a noninvasive anatomical biomarker to identify GERD susceptibility in postural deformities even before symptomatic reflux or herniation occurs.</p><p>Although MRI can provide excellent soft-tissue contrast, CT remains the most validated and widely used modality for hiatal morphometry, with strong reproducibility and correlation to intraoperative findings [<xref rid="B9-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B16-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. By contrast, MRI has been less frequently applied in this context, and its role in routine clinical practice remains limited.</p><p>These findings are further contextualized by the normative data established by Dass et al. [<xref rid="B19-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], who retrospectively evaluated the esophageal hiatal surface area (HSA) in 119 healthy adults using multiplanar MDCT reconstructions. They reported a mean HSA of 2.88 cm<sup>2</sup> in males and 2.51 cm<sup>2</sup> in females, with an overall mean of 2.70 cm<sup>2</sup> (range: 1.3&#8211;5.4 cm<sup>2</sup>). They found that sex, but not age, was significantly associated with HSA. Notably, their study excluded individuals with obesity, visible hernias, or diaphragmatic abnormalities, establishing a physiologic reference range for normal hiatus dimensions. When these reference values are applied to our cohort, the significantly larger HSA observed in the kyphosis group (mean 5.14 &#177; 1.31 cm<sup>2</sup>) exceeds the expected normal range even among males, suggesting that thoracic spinal curvature may exert a structural influence on diaphragmatic anatomy beyond physiologic variation. The absence of age-related HSA changes in both the Dass et al. [<xref rid="B19-tomography-11-00098" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] study and our control group further reinforces the interpretation that kyphosis, rather than age, underlies the observed hiatal remodeling. Thus, our results align with previously validated CT morphometry techniques and suggest that postural deformities may be associated with subclinical anatomical changes in the esophageal hiatus. These changes could potentially contribute to GERD and HH, but further prospective studies are necessary to confirm this relationship.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-tomography-11-00098"><title>5. Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, the multivariable regression model explained only 11.3% of the variance in hiatal surface area (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.113), indicating that the majority of HSA variability remains unaccounted for by the Cobb angle, age, and sex. Factors such as diaphragmatic muscle tone, body habitus, or subclinical herniation may also influence hiatus morphology and warrant investigation in future work.</p><p>Second, by design, we excluded all patients with overt hiatal hernias or other diaphragmatic pathologies. This selection criterion likely narrowed the observed range of HSA values, limiting the generalizability of our findings to patients who already exhibit herniation. Prospective cohorts that encompass the full spectrum of hiatal anatomy are needed to determine whether kyphosis&#8211;HSA relationships hold true in these populations.</p><p>Third, although age did not emerge as a significant predictor in our model, the inclusion of adults spanning 25 to 90 years may mask age-specific effects on HSA. Future studies should consider stratified analyses or narrower age cohorts to explore potential interactions between aging and spinal curvature on hiatus remodeling.</p><p>Fourth, the retrospective, single-center nature of this investigation, along with its modest sample size, may limit the external validity of our results. Larger, multicenter prospective studies will be essential to confirm these preliminary observations and to assess additional clinical and anatomical covariates.</p><p>Finally, a key limitation of our study is the absence of long-term follow-up data to evaluate whether patients with hiatal enlargement subsequently developed overt herniation. This lack of longitudinal data prevents us from assessing the predictive value of CT-based hiatus measurements for future herniation. Future prospective studies with long-term surveillance are required to determine whether hiatal widening in patients with thoracic kyphosis may serve as an early predictor of clinically significant hiatal hernia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec6-tomography-11-00098"><title>6. Conclusions</title><p>This study provides the first CT-based morphometric evidence that thoracic kyphosis is associated with measurable enlargement of the esophageal hiatus, even in the absence of overt herniation. A statistically significant increase in hiatal surface area (HSA) was observed in individuals with kyphotic deformity, with the Cobb angle emerging as an independent anatomical predictor. Although the explained variance was modest, these findings support the hypothesis that spinal curvature contributes to early structural remodeling of the diaphragmatic hiatus. Given its reproducibility, CT-derived HSA measurement may contribute to anatomical risk stratification in patients with postural spinal deformities. These findings suggest a possible role for CT-based morphometry in identifying anatomically at-risk populations, although further prospective studies are required to establish predictive value.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

The oblique axial plane was obtained by aligning with the diaphragmatic crura and orthogonal to the sagittal axis to best visualize the hiatal components for surface area measurement.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="tomography-11-00098-g001.jpg"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="tomography-11-00098-t003" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="pii">tomography-11-00098-t003_Table 3</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Multivariable regression analysis of hiatal surface area predictors.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Analysis</th><th align="left" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="left" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Value (&#946; [95% CI])</th><th align="left" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Multivariable regression</td><td align="left" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cobb angle</td><td align="left" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.028 (0.005&#8211;0.051)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.017 *</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
