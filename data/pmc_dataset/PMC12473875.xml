Consequently, the demands for 5G experimentation facilities have recently emerged from small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and 3rd party developers, requiring the abstraction of the complexities of the underlying infrastructure, platform, and related management and orchestration (MANO) systems, especially in multi-domain scenarios. This paper proposes a novel approach towards cross-domain service orchestration, which combines the flexibility of supporting different 5G Service Orchestrators (SOs) in various domains, while preserving compatibility through NetApps. The Cross-domain Service Orchestrator (CDSO) is based on ETSI&#8217;s Open Source MANO (OSM), with a <monospace>Requests Handler</monospace> module on top, which acts as the main integration point to the different domains&#8217; 5G SOs and other custom systems that are northbound. This would facilitate the interworking among independently orchestrated domains in supporting multi-domain services. The EU Horizon 2020 project, 5GMediaHUB, is presented as a use case, together with a first implementation of the <monospace>Requests Handler</monospace> and corresponding integrations. Nonetheless, the proposed approach is vertical-agnostic and is foreseen to accelerate service innovation and digitalization in any industry by laying the foundations in terms of service management and interconnectivity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cloud-native</kwd><kwd>ETSI OSM</kwd><kwd>multi-domain</kwd><kwd>netApps</kwd><kwd>orchestration</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>H2020 Innovation Action 5GMediaHUB</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>European Commission</funding-source><award-id>101016714</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>ANEMONE</funding-source><award-id>MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033</award-id><award-id>PID2021-126431OB-I00</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Generalitat de Catalunya</funding-source><award-id>2021 SGR 00770</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the H2020 Innovation Action 5GMediaHUB, funded by the European Commission under Grant 101016714.

Introduction
</title><p>Europe&#8217;s Digital Single Market Strategy [<xref rid="B1-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] seeks to tear down the barriers for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and 3rd party developers in relation to digitalization. Various 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) technologies are expected to enable more-disruptive applications and services from various vertical markets, boosting innovation and prototyping. Such verticals come with highly heterogeneous requirements, in terms of both quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE), and could potentially span multiple administrative and technological domains. Hence, proving success with 5G/B5G vertical trials entails handling the management complexities that come with such heterogeneity.</p><p>Pan-European pre-commercial testbeds have also gained popularity from 5G-PPP projects like 5G-VINNI [<xref rid="B2-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and 5G-EVE [<xref rid="B3-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], among others, for fostering vertical innovation and extensive trials. They have proven to advance 5G trials in a wide range of verticals (e.g., eHealth, Transportation, Industry 4.0, etc.), as well as in various use case scenarios (potentially spanning multiple domains). The business case for such experimentation facilities has also been recognized, along with a multi-stakeholder ecosystem [<xref rid="B4-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, with the current demand for self-service platforms on which vertical stakeholders could carry out development, testing, and/or performance evaluation on demand, it has become fundamental to abstract the underlying complexities of (multi-domain) infrastructures/networks and slice/service lifecycle management from the platform users.</p><p>Two key enablers have been identified for such an abstraction: (i) <bold>NetApps</bold> and (ii) a <bold>Cross-domain Service Orchestrator (CDSO)</bold>. NetApps are functions that abstract vertical applications from Network Services (NSs). They can be thought of as being akin to NSs in terms of packaging (with physical, virtual, and/or containerized constituent components) and management, but offer value-added services (either specific or agnostic to verticals). The CDSO will manage the lifecycle of NetApps across involved domains, while taking care of the attachment points between NetApps and 5G NSs. Note that an end-to-end (E2E) service can involve multiple NetApps, and having a single pane of glass for NetApp management on the CDSO (regardless of which domain a NetApp is deployed) would definitely lower the operation complexity.</p><p>With this in mind, a CDSO based on ETSI&#8217;s Open Source MANO (OSM) [<xref rid="B5-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] is presented in this paper. The CDSO internal architecture is presented with a <monospace>Requests Handler</monospace> module on top of the OSM, which is designed as the main integration point in relation to the different components of the E2E chain. Additionally, workflows for (i) NetApp onboarding and (ii) E2E slice ordering are illustrated and described. Though originally proposed under the framework of 5GMediaHUB [<xref rid="B6-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the approach is expected to go beyond the project, i.e., any Custom System northbound can be integrated into the CDSO, and benefit from a multi-domain platform. The 5GMediaHUB use case is presented as a proof-of-concept, with a first implementation of the <monospace>Requests Handler</monospace> and the NetApp onboarding workflow. In this case, the Custom System is 5GMediaHUB&#8217;s <italic toggle="yes">Experimentation Tools</italic> layer, which enable developers to design, onboard, and test media NetApps and next-generation scenarios.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. <xref rid="sec2-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="sec">Section 2</xref> provides a brief background and related work on cross-domain service orchestration. <xref rid="sec3-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="sec">Section 3</xref> takes a closer look into the proposed approach and CDSO internal design, followed by the related workflows in <xref rid="sec4-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="sec">Section 4</xref>. <xref rid="sec5-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="sec">Section 5</xref> describes the 5GMediaHUB use case with implementation and integration perspectives. Finally, conclusions are drawn in <xref rid="sec6-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="sec">Section 6</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-sensors-25-05804"><title>2. Background and Related Work</title><p>The cross-domain orchestration landscape for E2E services is shaped by varying interpretations from different organizations and standardization bodies with respect to key concepts like slices, services, and network services&#160;[<xref rid="B7-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Consequently, a number of 5G-PPP projects adopted differing paths in the development of cross-domain federation models.</p><p>For example, the 5G-VINNI project adopts a federated, standards-based approach to orchestrate network slices across domains, enhancing interoperability and service delivery&#160;[<xref rid="B8-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, this approach introduces operational complexity when coordinating multiple orchestration systems across large networks. Similarly, the 5G-EPICENTRE project&#160;[<xref rid="B9-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] focuses on NetApp-based development, federating testbeds through a Karmada control plane. However, it is limited to Kubernetes, overlooking Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architectures. Several projects, like 5GCity [<xref rid="B10-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and 5GTango [<xref rid="B11-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], have contributed to cross-domain orchestration, primarily within NFV-compliant, single-domain environments. These projects, while valuable, highlight the need for orchestration solutions that transcend single-domain, Kubernetes-only or NFV-only setups to support multi-domain service delivery.</p><p>Other works in the literature have also explored different aspects of federation, including combinations of federation models such as hierarchical, peer-to-peer, and recursive configurations but also involving the deployment of specific MANO artifacts in each domain and federation point [<xref rid="B12-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], as well as the use of marketplace and auction strategies towards cooperative resource provisioning across the domains [<xref rid="B13-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Note that the term &#8216;domain&#8217; has been used in different contexts in the literature, such as technological domains of the radio access, transport and core network segments, and telecom operators&#8217; administrative domains. In this work, &#8216;domain&#8217; refers to an administrative boundary, such as a public or private mobile network, each with distinct network identities. We propose an approach that addresses interoperability challenges observed in existing projects, paving the way for more flexible and scalable cross-domain orchestration.</p><p>The following sub-sections seek to provide a mapping of the 3GPP-ETSI slice management framework with the federation models adopted in different 5G-PPP projects, highlighting the novelty of the proposed approach.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-sensors-25-05804"><title>2.1. Slice Management in 3GPP-ETSI</title><p>In 3GPP [<xref rid="B14-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], three main functions are associated with network slice lifecycle management and orchestration (MANO), as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Communication Service Management Function (CSMF): Translates service-related requirements to network slice specifications.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Network Slice Management Function (NSMF): Manages E2E slices and derives network slice subnet requirements.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Network Slice Subnet Management Function (NSSMF): Manages individual network slice subnets.</p></list-item></list></p><p>These functions are grouped in the <italic toggle="yes">Vertical Slicer</italic> layer, where service requirements from verticals are mapped to network slices. Each network slice (or subnet) is further decomposed into network services, which are broken down into physical/virtual/containerized functions (PNFs/VNFs/CNFs), managed within ETSI&#8217;s NFV-MANO framework [<xref rid="B15-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-sensors-25-05804"><title>2.2. Federation Models Adopted in 5G-PPP Projects</title><p>In single-domain scenarios, vertical slice requests are processed through the Operations Support System / Business Support System (OSS/BSS) layer and are mapped to resources via the 3GPP-ETSI chain. Multi-domain scenarios, however, require federation across these components, a challenge that is addressed by various 5G-PPP projects. As shown in <xref rid="sensors-25-05804-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, federation decisions in these projects occur at different levels: (i)&#160;<bold>OSS/BSS</bold> for 5G-VINNI&#8217;s OSS; (ii) <bold>CSMF</bold> for 5G-EVE&#8217;s Multi-site Network Service Orchestrator; (iii) <bold>OSS/BSS+CSMF</bold> for 5G-SOLUTIONS&#8217; CDSO [<xref rid="B16-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; and (iv) the <bold>full 3GPP-ETSI stack</bold> for 5GMediaHUB&#8217;s CDSO. Although the proposed approach appears complex, it simplifies operations by using OSM to consolidate these roles, with the CDSO managing NetApp lifecycles and 5G SOs handling 5G NSs.</p><p>As regards federation points, three types can be seen from <xref rid="sensors-25-05804-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>: (i) <bold>OSS/BSS-to-OSS/BSS</bold>; (ii) <bold>OSS/BSS-to-NSMF</bold>; and (iii) <bold>NSMF-to-NSMF</bold>. The 5G-VINNI system had ambitions to experiment with all three types, and the second type (i.e., interworking between OSS/BSS and NSMF) proved to be the most challenging. The third type is common among all projects, but 5GMediaHUB&#8217;s novelty comes with the CDSO having its own NSMF, which needs to interwork with each of the domains&#8217; NSMFs. Due to the aforementioned separation of concerns, federation is further simplified as the <bold>NSMF-to-NSMF</bold> interaction, which will only have to handle the attach points between the 5G NSs and NetApps; the chaining of NetApps will be handled by the CDSO itself. Hence, from a potential fully meshed to a star setup, the domains will now only need to integrate with the CDSO, improving scalability.</p><p>In particular, each domain needs to expose (i) Virtual Infrastructure Manager/s (VIM/s) and/or Container Infrastructure Service Manager/s (CISMs) for hosting the NetApps, and (ii) 5G SO for 5G NS ordering. By giving the domains the flexibility and control to host platform/s and 5G NSs, which are to be made available for cross-domain services, and having a single pane of glass for NetApp management on the CDSO, potential conflicts inherent to multi-stakeholder environments can be mitigated and minimized. OSM has long been envisioned to interwork with independently orchestrated domains&#8212;either by a proprietary orchestration system or by another OSM instance&#8212;in a layered architecture&#160;[<xref rid="B17-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], matching the design principles of the CDSO.</p><p>The CDSO of 5GMediaHUB is foreseen to go beyond the project in terms of enabling interworking among independently orchestrated 5G domains, which is now becoming a must-have for supporting 5G and beyond use cases and services.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-sensors-25-05804"><title>3. Cross-Domain Service Orchestration</title><p>An overview of the proposed approach is first presented in this section, followed by an in-depth description of the CDSO&#8217;s internal architecture. Moreover, the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) NetApp is presented as a supplementary CDSO feature&#8212;a cornerstone of its unique approach of combining NFV-compliant (for OSM deployment) and cloud-native (for standard Kubernetes deployments) NetApps.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-sensors-25-05804"><title>3.1. Proposed Approach</title><p>As services start to span multiple sites and/or multiple operator domains&#8212;each potentially managed by its own orchestration system&#8212;it is necessary to enable both data plane connectivity among sites and interworking among their orchestration systems. The proposed federation model is unique to this end. For instance, the right-most part of <xref rid="sensors-25-05804-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> illustrates a cross-domain E2E slice, involving two domains&#8212;Domain A and Domain B. User equipment (UE) in each domain can connect to their corresponding 5G NSs, which are then attached to the NetApps. A domain&#8217;s 5G SO is responsible for the lifecycle management of the 5G NSs (e.g., of the 5G Core). On the other hand, the CDSO is responsible for the lifecycle management of the NetApps, as well as the constituent functions in the chain, which are potentially deployed in multiple domains. Additionally, the CDSO needs to coordinate with the involved domains&#8217; 5G SOs to forward the necessary information for attaching NetApps to the 5G NSs, as well as attaching the latter to UEs.</p><p>Each domain is supposed to expose one or more VIM/s and/or CISMs to the CDSO, on which the NetApps can be deployed. It is important to note that both 5G NSs and NetApps can be mapped to a 3GPP Network Slice Subnet Instance (NSSI), and one or several NetApps can be deployed in any domain(s) as part of a use case scenario. This means that the E2E slice will be composed of 5G NSs and NetApps (from one or several NetApps) deployed in the involved domain(s).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-sensors-25-05804"><title>3.2. Internal Architecture</title><p>OSM is used as a basis for the CDSO, with its well-established Information Model (IM), Northbound Interface (NBI), multi-site deployment support, and monitoring capabilities. OSM already supports VIM/CISM application programming interfaces (APIs) for the lifecycle management and monitoring of NSs (and/or NetApps) on a wide selection of VIM/CISM targets (e.g., Openstack VIMs and Kubernetes clusters, among others). To the best of our knowledge, previous OSM-based federation focused on multi-site deployments, in which a centralized orchestrator manages the lifecycle of services (both 3GPP and non-3GPP alike) for all domains.</p><p>However, it is important to take into account that the domains may adopt different technologies and architectures across their infrastructures. What was missing was the ability to enable the domains to independently orchestrate their respective 5G networks, in potentially different approaches (e.g., an open-source 5G SO or a proprietary one).</p><p>To bridge this gap, a <monospace>Requests Handler</monospace> module is designed on top of OSM to handle the necessary integrations, specifically to translate/forward the different requests from any Custom System northbound (e.g., at the OSS/BSS level) towards the CDSO&#8217;s OSM instance and towards the domains&#8217; 5G SOs. The <monospace>Requests Handler</monospace> seeks to be the main integration point that facilitates interworking among independently orchestrated 5G domains.</p><p>As shown in <xref rid="sensors-25-05804-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, the <monospace>Requests Handler</monospace> includes the following three components:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The <monospace>Service bus</monospace>, which is the CDSO&#8217;s main interface with the Custom Systems, as well as with the domains&#8217; 5G SOs.

The PaaS NetApp</title><p>PaaS serves as an abstraction layer for NetApps, aligning with cloud-native design principles. This layer streamlines the use of container technologies while abstracting the underlying cloud infrastructure&#8212;including networking, servers, operating systems, and storage and platform services. This enables developers to focus on deploying and configuring applications without managing infrastructure complexity, as well as the need for packaging the NetApps into CNFs.</p><p>Within this architectural framework, the PaaS abstraction layer is delivered through a PaaS NetApp [<xref rid="B18-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which falls into the categories of either a VNF Common Service or a VNF Dedicated Service in accordance with ETSI GR NFV-IFA 029 [<xref rid="B19-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Implemented as a container-based service, it operates atop the NFVI (specifically, OpenStack) and is realized through a set of Ansible scripts for the Kubespray controller, deployed by the OSM. These Ansible scripts automate the generation of cloud-init files, which bootstraps Kubernetes clusters hosted within VNFs instantiated by OSM. One VNF acts as the Kubernetes controller, and cluster scaling is achieved by instantiating or deleting VNF hosts. OSM orchestrates network resources, while the CISM (Kubernetes) within the VIM handles containerized workloads and services.</p><p>In this setup, the CDSO&#8217;s OSM can orchestrate and delete the VMs responsible for hosting Kubernetes clusters (network resources), while Kubernetes itself acts as the application orchestrator. The PaaS NetApp interfaces with OSM via REST APIs to create and launch a cluster as an NSSI. Additionally, it connects with the Kubernetes cluster through the RESTful API, utilizing Kubespray and the Kubernetes Federation API v2 as the PaaS&#160;controller.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-sensors-25-05804"><title>4.

The 5GMediaHUB Use Case</title><p>The 5GMediaHUB model seeks to offer an elastic, secure, and multi-tenant 5G experimentation facility for the development, testing, and validation of NetApps for 3rd party media stakeholders.

The CDSO is a key component, acting as an umbrella orchestrator that automates network/service and slice management across the domains of the underlying heterogeneous 5G testbeds. Two 5G testbeds, operated by Telenor (Norway) and CTTC (Spain), are interconnected over the G&#200;ANT network and are made available for the facility, hence providing two domains for the use case scenarios and supporting multi-domain NetApp deployments.</p><p>In this section, 5GMediaHUB&#8217;s <italic toggle="yes">Experimentation Tools</italic> layer is first described, which acts as the Custom System, followed by the current CDSO <monospace>Requests Handler</monospace> implementation and its integration with the <monospace>NetApps Repository</monospace>.

Requests Handler Implementation</title><p>The CDSO&#8217;s <monospace>Requests Handler</monospace> implemented in 5GMediaHUB utilizes the message broker feature of a Redis database. Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine [<xref rid="B21-sensors-25-05804" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This serves as a cloud-native backend for a Redis Queue (RQ), which is a simple Python library for queuing jobs/events in a FIFO manner to be processed in the background.</p><p>A job or event is a Python object, representing the <monospace>Requests Handler</monospace> function that should be invoked as a background process. The RQ can easily be integrated into a web stack (e.g., using a Python Flask server as a web API). It is important to note that as a cloud-native solution, the CDSO is inherently scalable and does not pose a performance bottleneck, since its software components can be dynamically scaled to meet demands.</p><p>The internal elements of the <monospace>Requests Handler</monospace> are shown in the yellow block in <xref rid="sensors-25-05804-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. The web API in the current implementation accepts (i) <italic toggle="yes">OSM requests</italic> in relation to either the CDSO&#8217;s internal OSM instance for NetApps or an OSM-based 5G SO of a given domain for 5G NSs; and (ii) <italic toggle="yes">PaaS requests</italic> in relation to available PaaS instance(s) from the domain(s). Each request returns a unique 128-bit identifier, which must be used when checking the status of the request, e.g., if it is queuing, executing, or has ended successfully. Requests to other 5G SO implementations (e.g., proprietary solutions such as Nokia&#8217;s orchestration stack) can also be easily added once a service ordering API is made&#160;available.</p></sec><sec id="sec5dot3-sensors-25-05804"><title>5.3.

It is intended as an experimentation tool for 5GMediaHUB developers, offering flexible and user-friendly design and the deployment of NetApps, as shown in <xref rid="sensors-25-05804-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>. The <monospace>NetApps Repository</monospace> consists of several interconnected components, as follows: (i) a back-end service, which serves as the core of the system; (ii) a front-end web application for user interaction; (iii) a Service Catalogue for function discovery; and (iv) a GitLab instance for NetApp project storage.</p><p>All <monospace>NetApps Repository</monospace> deployment queries are relayed via the <monospace>Requests Handler</monospace>, allowing seamless integration with the CDSO. This enables the <monospace>NetApps Repository</monospace> to query/create/update/delete NetApp packages and deploy NetApps at either testbed via a unified interface. A command prefix mechanism ensures that requests are directed to the appropriate endpoint, facilitating multi-testbed operations and both standard Kubernetes and NFV-based NetApp deployments.</p></sec><sec id="sec5dot4-sensors-25-05804"><title>5.4. Evaluation</title><p>The 5GMediaHUB use case mainly focused on the architecture and workflow design, as well as the development of the CDSO and Custom System components, with the aim of delivering a proof-of-concept over the two domains provided by Telenor and CTTC.

Conclusions</title><p>The use of 5G technologies is expected to enable more disruptive services and applications from a wide range of verticals and use case scenarios. However, to ensure technology uptake by SMEs and 3rd party developers, it has become fundamental to abstract the complexities of the underlying infrastructure, platform, and related management and orchestration systems, especially in multi-domain scenarios.</p><p>A novel approach for cross-domain service orchestration is proposed, combining the flexibility of supporting different 5G SOs at the platform level, while preserving compatibility at the NetApps level. With ETSI&#8217;s OSM as a basis for the CDSO, a <monospace>Requests Handler</monospace> module is designed to be developed on top that would act as the main integration point to the different components of the domains&#8217; infrastructure/platform (i.e., 5G SOs and DMSs) and Custom System(s) northbound. This would facilitate the interworking among independently orchestrated domains in supporting multi-domain services. Workflows for NetApp onboarding, E2E slice ordering, and monitoring service ordering are also illustrated and&#160;described.</p><p>Lastly, the 5GMediaHUB use case for the CDSO is presented, which is a proof-of-concept for the proposed cross-domain orchestration approach that substantially improves scalability and reduces federation complexity. With 5GMediaHUB&#8217;s <italic toggle="yes">Experimentation Tools</italic> layer acting as the Custom System, the design, onboarding, and testing of NetApps and next-generation scenarios for the media industry can be simplified and can accelerate the development and rollout of disruptive media services.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Special thanks to Konstantinos Ramantas for the technical discussions regarding the CDSO positioning beyond the state of the art.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
