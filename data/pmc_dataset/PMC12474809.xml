Radiation sickness and radiation sialadenitis are acute adverse events that have frequently been associated with RAI; they can be treated relatively easily with medications or follow-up observation. Laryngeal edema is a rare acute adverse event after RAI. Although the frequency of this event is low, if laryngeal edema does occur, there is a risk of airway obstruction&#8212;a potentially serious complication.</p><p id="Par9">The cause of laryngeal edema has not been established. Two possible causes are radiation-induced inflammation from remnant thyroid tissue and allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The application of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has provided accurate absolute quantifications of radioisotopeuptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and new image-analysis software can measure the quantitative parameters including the standardized uptake value (SUV) and the absolute radioactivity concentration of uptake sites. Our research group has reported the quantitative evaluation of thyroid bed uptake in adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. We have also encountered three patients with post-RAI laryngeal edema whose quantitative uptake values in the thyroid bed were very high compared to cases without edema. Before their I-131 RAI therapy, two of the patients underwent a total thyroidectomy and the third underwent a near-total thyroidectomy. In this study, we compared the patients'quantitative thyroid-bed values with those of similar patients who did not develop laryngeal edema.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods of quantitative evaluation</title><p id="Par10">The patients'I-131 whole-body scan and SPECT/CT were conducted 3&#160;days after the administration of RAI with a SPECT/CT system (Symbia Intevo 6, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). We used Syngo.via imaging software (Siemens Healthcare), which allowed us to measure the SUV and absolute radioactivity concentration (kBq/mL) in the lesion with the highest uptake. Volume of interest (VOI) segmentation was performed based on 40% of the maximum SUV value, and quantitative parameters (SUV and kBq/mL) were then calculated within the defined VOI This fixed-percentage threshold segmentation is an inbuilt contouring method recommended by Siemens, in which all voxels within a user-defined sphere with values&#8201;&gt;&#8201;40% of the maximum voxel value are included to determine the region of interest (ROI). The maximum SUV (SUVmax), mean SUV (SUVmean), maximum kBq/mL (max kBq/mL), and mean kBq/mL (mean kBq/mL) within the defined ROI were automatically calculated. The method was carried out as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">We compared the SUV and kBq/mL values of the thyroid bed of the present three patients with those of 14 patients identified in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] who did not develop laryngeal edema after a total thyroidectomy and the administration of 3.70&#160;GBq of I-131.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Case reports</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient 1</title><p id="Par12">A 61-year-old Japanese woman had undergone a right thyroid lobectomy for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid 20&#160;years ago.

However, the symptoms were mild, she did not require any treatment, and she was monitored. Two days later, laryngoscopy was performed because there was no improvement in symptoms. The laryngoscopy demonstrated that the patient's epiglottis was swollen, the posterior interpharyngeal space had narrowed, and the airway was constricted (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The patient's symptoms gradually improved with careful observation alone, and she was discharged 4&#160;days after the RAI administration as planned.

This suggests a possible association between high radiation dose to the thyroid bed and the occurrence of laryngeal edema.

The occurrence of laryngeal edema following radioactive iodine therapy is rare, with only a small number of cases documented. However, Kinuya et al. reported that three (2.9%) of 102 patients who underwent I-131 therapy for thyroid cancer developed laryngeal edema, suggesting that the incidence of laryngeal edema might be higher than previously thought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Particularly in Japan, when doses of 1.11&#160;GBq or more are administered, patients must be hospitalized in treatment rooms, requiring isolation for a certain period. If laryngeal edema occurs during this isolation period, it could lead to significant confusion regarding the treatment site.</p><p id="Par20">Bal et al. reported that 15 (16.1%) of 93 patients who received 0.55&#8211;2.22&#160;GBq of I-131 after undergoing a hemithyroidectomy for thyroid cancer developed laryngeal edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Among them, three patients were treated with prednisolone; the remaining patients were managed with analgesics alone. Bal et al. noted that they considered radiation-induced thyroiditis to be the cause of laryngeal edema in each case, but their report does not mention differences in quantitative values of the thyroid bed between the cases with and without edema.</p><p id="Par21">Kinuya et al. suggested that the mechanism of laryngeal edema caused by RAI remains largely unclear but the edema is often improved with antiallergic medications and hydrocortisone, leading them to speculate that some form of allergic reaction might be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similarly, Goolden et al. suggested that an allergic reaction to degenerated thyroid tissue might be a potential mechanism for dyspnea occurring within 48&#160;h after I-131 administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Although our present sample size is limited to the cases of three patients with laryngeal edema, all three patients demonstrated significantly higher quantitative values in the thyroid bed compared to 14 patients without edema. This suggests that high I-131 uptake in the thyroid bed might be a contributing factor to the development of laryngeal edema.</p><p id="Par23">Although not directly related to the study&#8217;s primary aim, we note that external radiation exposure at a distance of 1&#160;m from the patients was measured 48&#160;h after I-131 administration as part of routine discharge criteria in Japan (&lt;&#8201;30 &#956;Sv/h). However, no consistent relationship between this measurement and the occurrence of laryngeal edema was observed in the present cases.</p><p id="Par24">Landstr&#246;m et al. suggested, based on their own cases and a review of 4studies, that residual thyroid tissue and high doses of I-131 might contribute to the development of laryngeal edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, they also did not mention differences in the quantitative values of the thyroid bed uptake between cases with and without edema. In contrast, our study provides novel findings by quantitatively demonstrating that the radiation dose to the thyroid bed in cases with laryngeal edema was significantly higher compared to cases without edema.</p><p id="Par25">One limitation of this study is the small sample size (n&#8201;=&#8201;3). A further accumulation of cases is necessary to validate these findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par26">In summary, we quantitatively confirmed that I-131 accumulated to a high degree in patients who developed laryngeal edema, and our findings suggest that an extremely high I-131 uptake in the thyroid bed could be one of the causes of laryngeal edema.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DTC</term><def><p id="Par1">Differentiated thyroid cancer)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RAI</term><def><p id="Par2">Radioactive iodine therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPECT</term><def><p id="Par3">Single photon emission computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SUV</term><def><p id="Par4">Standardized uptake value</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p id="Par5">Computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VOI</term><def><p id="Par6">Volume of interest</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROI</term><def><p id="Par7">Region of interest</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>KK and KM designed the study.
