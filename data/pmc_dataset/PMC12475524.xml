A literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. Publications reporting on NGO-related oral health promotions and activities were included in this review. A thematic framework was used to synthesize the literature according to NGOs&#8217; roles, targeted beneficiaries, and evaluation measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1363 references were identified by literature search, and 23 articles were included in this review. It was found that NGOs served various targeted beneficiaries, especially disadvantaged groups, such as children, homeless people, and older adults in developing countries and lower-income societies. NGOs functioned in various roles, &#8216;professional doctors&#8217;, &#8216;service providers&#8217;, &#8216;public educators&#8217;, &#8216;proactive volunteers&#8217;, &#8216;industry trainers&#8217;, &#8216;active advocates&#8217;, &#8216;field researchers&#8217;, and &#8216;potential funder&#8217;, to provide both direct and indirect services. Project evaluations were conducted regarding programme-oriented, beneficiary-oriented, and organization-oriented evaluations with a mixed-method design.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>NGOs play an active role in promoting and improving people&#8217;s oral health and well-being by providing various services and activities. The multifaceted involvement of NGOs highlights their importance in improving oral health outcomes and addressing oral health disparities in broad community settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical relevance</title><p>This review shows a landscape view of the various roles of NGOs in oral health promotion. It is expected to strengthen the power of NGOs to implement a wide range of activities by collaborating across sectors and engaging various stakeholders.

Second, uncovering the interconnectedness between oral health and civil society sectors can inspire interdisciplinary research, fostering innovative approaches to address complex public health challenges. Third, identifying successful NGO models and cross-sector collaborations can guide policy recommendations and the design of scalable, sustainable programmes.

Complementary to previous research,<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> we found that the locations of NGOs vary from developed to developing countries, with a wide range of services available from international dental aid and outreach programmes to community-based dental care, education, and treatment. It is important to take the nature, location, and type of NGOs into consideration when understanding their multiple roles and dynamic functions in promoting oral health. Meanwhile, different NGOs have programmes with multiple objectives. These NGOs simultaneously undertake various roles to provide direct and indirect services, such as dental outreach programmes and advocacy for the greater awareness of the public and the government towards oral health issues. Innovative tools and approaches such as mobile health (mHealth) technologies can be employed to enhance oral health education, particularly among vulnerable populations such as older adults.<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> Indeed, emerging technologies, such as smartphone-based self-monitoring tools powered by artificial intelligence (AI), represent promising opportunities for future application. AI tools can significantly improve efficiency and productivity, lead to better decision-making, and ultimately, improve outcomes. NGOs may consider to make use of AI tools to enhance their engagement and impact on oral health promotion. For example, AI tools can be used to screen gingivitis and to personalize prosthodontics treatment,<xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> which significantly reduces the demand for manpower and resources. The use of AI tools by NGOs may improve the efficacy of oral health services so as to expand the reach of NGOs services in resource-limited settings.</p><p id="para0037">NGOs&#8217; oral health services are also facing the challenges of localization and generalization in different contexts. In other words, how do NGOs adapt to the local contexts? This study reviews a strategy to integrate oral health into public health and to make it more accessible and responsive. There are different types of localization, such as multiobjective public health programmes (oral health is one component), indirectly delivered oral care services via trainers, and dental treatment provided in addition to health promotion.<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Another strategy is to establish partnerships and network with local stakeholders, including the local government, industry, and communities.<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Emerging technologies, such as smartphone-based self-monitoring tools powered by AI, offer promising avenues for NGOs to deliver preventive oral health services more effectively.<xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> However, the sustainability of NGOs&#8217; services and their impact on the local community have been challenged because of the conflicting expectations and perceived treatment outcomes by patients, dentists, and NGO staff, limited financial resources, logistic and communication barriers, and increasing administrative burden.<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p><p id="para0038">Systematic and scientific evaluation should be an integral component of an oral health programme to monitor the effectiveness of NGOs&#8217; contribution in oral health promotion. However, this review found that 12 out of 23 studies did not report any evaluation on programme/projects. Further, many of the existing evaluations were limited in scope, relying primarily on biomedical paradigms and quantitative methods rooted in clinical research.<xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Despite positive outcomes based on a biomedical mode, the overall quality of evidence on evaluation remains limited due to short-term assessment timeframes, inadequate or unspecified evaluation methodologies, and limited use of robust outcome measures and theory-based frameworks.<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> In fact, the theory of change framework is considered as a promising approach to guide programme evaluation.<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> In addition, insufficient information was presented regarding role and nature of the evaluators. It is unclear the evaluations were conducted by the NGOs themselves or independent third parties. Thus, possible bias remains unknown to readers. Future efforts should be made to explore the application and contextual adaptation of such frameworks to evaluate NGO-led interventions, especially in relation to targeted populations, local communities, and programme implementation processes.</p><p id="para0039">Despite the valuable insights gained from this scoping review, several limitations should be acknowledged: first, this review was limited to peer-reviewed literature, excluding grey literature such as NGO reports, policy briefs, and unpublished documents. Our intention is to focus on peer-reviewed literature to maintain methodological consistency and data quality. However, this may lead to possible omission of information on real-world NGO programmes that are active in practice but undocumented in academic journals. Future studies should consider to incorporates broader information sources, such as grey literature, organizational case studies, and programme reports, to better capture the breadth of NGO involvement in oral health promotions. Second, the reliance on published studies introduces the risk of publication bias, where successful or well-documented projects are more likely to be reported, while less successful or smaller-scale NGO activities may remain undocumented. This may skew the representation of NGO roles and impact in oral health promotion. Exploring only peer-reviewed databases may capture just the &#8216;tip of the iceberg&#8217; in understanding the full extent of NGOs&#8217; contributions to oral health. Many impactful NGO activities, especially those in remote or resource-constrained areas, may not be formally studied or published, limiting the ability to capture the true breadth of their work.</p><p id="para0040">The findings of this review provide current knowledge in both research and clinical contexts, warranting future research. First, it is crucial to explore the dynamics of cross-sector collaboration among key stakeholders involved in promoting oral health, including NGOs, government offices, communities, corporate companies, and higher education institutions. Both global and local organizations are suggested to explore good practices and stakeholder collaboration. Secondly, practical barriers NGOs faced and their coping strategies should be further researched. These current barriers include structural challenges, such as top-down approaches limited to technical thinking in specific contexts. Additionally, financial constraints, honest evaluation, shortage of human resources, and organizational change pose significant challenges for all organizations. How dental NGOs use different strategies to tackle the barriers is of both theoretical and practical significance. Thirdly, special types of NGOs, such as global dental aid organizations, require further research to understand their diversity, activities, and limitations. The influence of sociocultural and contextual factors should be taken into consideration. Lastly, more investigation is warranted regarding the evidence-based evaluation of NGOs and their tendency to demonstrate accountability in their services and adapt to multiple roles. Understanding the extent to which NGOs integrate evidence-based practices and evaluating the impact of their interventions can provide valuable insights for improving their effectiveness. To support these efforts, future research should incorporate broader sources to better capture the breadth of NGO involvement in oral health promotion.</p><p id="para0041">Oral health is recognized as a fundamental human right, yet stark disparities in access to oral healthcare persist, particularly among marginalized and underserved populations. Our findings showed that NGOs play a vital role in bridging these gaps, often stepping in where public health systems fall short &#8211; especially in resource-constrained areas or in developed nations where services may be unevenly distributed or deprioritized. NGOs also made contributions to equity by enabling more inclusive access to oral health services by providing direct treatment services and also indirect support. However, the impact of these actions was not well evaluated. As an interface between the community and government, NGOs aim to reduce inequity and play a unique and vital role in helping communities establish health security.<xref rid="bib0047" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> By identifying and mapping the diverse roles of NGOs in oral health promotion, this study provides invaluable insights to help NGOs strategically leverage their resources and expertise to deliver a broader range of services more effectively. Strengthening cross-sector collaborations, including partnerships with governments, academic institutions, and private organizations, can unlock additional resources, knowledge, and funding opportunities, enabling NGOs to scale up their impact. Furthermore, understanding successful service models and evaluation methods can guide NGOs in refining their programmes, adopting evidence-based practices, and demonstrating measurable outcomes. This integrated, equity-driven approach enhances the sustainability and impact of oral health promotion efforts, contributing to a fairer and more inclusive health landscape.</p></sec><sec id="sec0022"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="para0042">NGOs play an active role in promoting and improving people&#8217;s oral health and well-being by providing both direct and indirect services.
