An in-depth analysis of key traits affecting rice lodging resistance is crucial for guiding the cultivation of excellent rice varieties and field production. Given consumer demand for high-quality rice and frequent extreme weather conditions, this study focused on six high-quality conventional rice varieties and compared the main stem internode physical traits, stem and sheath plumpness traits, main stem mechanical properties, yield-related traits, and panicle characteristics of the plants based on field phenotype measurements. Among them, three varieties showed lodging resistance in the field, while the other three varieties all experienced varying degrees of lodging susceptibility. The results showed that lodging-resistant varieties exhibited a more reasonable internode structure, lower plant height, gravity center height, and relative gravity center height, as well as shorter and thicker second internodes (N2). Additionally, they had higher sheath phimosis degree, greater bending stress, internode-breaking moment, and plant-breaking moment, along with a lower lodging index compared to lodging-susceptible varieties. Specifically, lodging-resistant varieties had 0.83&#8211;9.61% lower plant height, 4.11&#8211;16.10% lower gravity center height, and 0.09&#8211;12.68% lower relative gravity center height than those of lodging-susceptible varieties. Their N2 internode length was 8.96&#8211;44.69% shorter, while stem and sheath weight ratios were 16.37&#8211;268.58% and 8.27&#8211;165.01% higher than those of lodging-susceptible varieties, respectively. At the same time, lodging-resistant varieties exhibit the ability to stabilize yield while reducing their own risk of lodging by increasing effective panicles and reducing single panicle weight. In addition, NX42, LD3, and SY17 were ultimately evaluated as low-risk lodging varieties in this study. This study aims to address the lodging problem of high-quality conventional rice and analyze the key mechanisms underlying its lodging resistance. The research provides important theoretical support for genetic improvement of high-quality conventional rice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>high-quality</kwd><kwd>conventional rice</kwd><kwd>lodging characteristics</kwd><kwd>lodging</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>The National Key R&amp;D Program of China</funding-source><award-id>2018YFD0301001</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by The National Key R&amp;D Program of China (Project ID: 2018YFD0301001).</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-plants-14-02878"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Rice is a staple food and primary energy source for nearly half of the world&#8217;s population. It has a significant impact on nutrition and health [<xref rid="B1-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With the socioeconomic development accompanied by continuous improvement in living standards, people pay more attention to and pursue the quality and safety of food. Consumers&#8217; demand for rice has also shifted from quantity to high quality [<xref rid="B2-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. But for a long time, high yield has been regarded as the main goal of rice breeding to meet the rapid growth of the world&#8217;s population [<xref rid="B3-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. At the same time, there is a contradiction between achieving high yield and high quality of rice. Most high-yield hybrid rice varieties exhibit a decline in rice quality. After cooking, the rice has high hardness and poor viscosity [<xref rid="B4-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. But with further innovation in breeding technology, breeders are accelerating the selection of high-quality rice varieties. The overall objective is to maintain excellent rice quality on the basis of yield and resistance properties to meet the needs of rice production [<xref rid="B5-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Currently, there is a significant increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of strong convective weather, including extreme heat and extreme rainfall, globally. This has become the most serious challenge to food production. Extreme precipitation indicators were significantly and negatively correlated with rice yields in Jiangsu and Hainan Provinces, China [<xref rid="B6-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Related studies also show that under different climate changes, extreme heat events and extreme precipitation events in rice-producing areas are on the rise in the future [<xref rid="B7-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Rainfall is often accompanied by strong winds. Strong winds exceeding the carrying capacity of rice stems will directly lead to rice lodging. If the soil moisture is too high, the roots cannot firmly root. Combined with strong winds, the risk of rice lodging will further increase.</p><p>Plant structure is one of the important agronomic traits that determines the formation of rice grain yield and quality. It is mainly influenced by factors such as tillering, stem characteristics, and panicle morphology. Effective tillering ensures an effective number of panicles, which is crucial for achieving high crop yields [<xref rid="B8-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Dwarf phenotype is beneficial for rice to resist lodging. But if the plant is too short, it will lead to insufficient growth, ultimately affecting the yield potential of rice. So, under low lodging risk, it is necessary to increase plant height to improve yield [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further analysis was conducted on non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in rice stem sheaths. The results revealed that these stored NSCs participate in grain filling. Moreover, they significantly influence both the initiation and enrichment of grain filling. Consequently, NSCs further affect rice quality. A significant positive correlation was observed between the brown rice rate and the accumulation of soluble sugars and starch in the panicle. The chalkiness degree was significantly or highly significantly correlated with the soluble sugar accumulation in stems and leaves [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. And lignocellulose, as a structural carbohydrate, is the key to crop lodging resistance. Plant stems not only provide transportation of water and nutrients but also provide rigidity and strength for plants to resist external environments [<xref rid="B11-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Among them, lignin content is significantly correlated with the mechanical strength of cell walls and the lodging resistance of stems. Compared to cellulose, the lignin content in stems has a greater impact on stem strength. Its content can be used as an indicator to evaluate crop lodging resistance [<xref rid="B12-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, a reasonable panicle shape can reduce the risk of crop lodging. The increase in grain weight per panicle and plant height of heavy panicle rice varieties may lead to an increase in bending moment, which may increase the risk of lodging. But if the bending resistance of rice is significantly improved, the overall stem lodging resistance will not be significantly reduced [<xref rid="B13-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Rice populations with smaller panicle types and more effective panicles can achieve dual improvements in high yield and lodging resistance [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In northern japonica rice, the lodging index of upright and semi upright panicle type rice varieties is smaller than that of curved panicle type rice varieties, indicating better lodging resistance [<xref rid="B15-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, the lodging resistance of rice is a complex comprehensive trait.</p><p>The conclusions of different studies on key traits affecting rice lodging vary. The mechanical judgment method and model evaluation method are the main international evaluation methods for the lodging resistance of rice stems [<xref rid="B16-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Among them, lodging index and internode bending resistance are the main indicators for evaluating the lodging resistance of rice using mechanical judgment methods [<xref rid="B19-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. But some studies suggest that compared to the lodging index evaluation, assessing rice&#8217;s lodging resistance based on the physical strength of the stem may be more accurate [<xref rid="B20-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Other researchers suggest that the internode bending resistance is not perfect in demonstrating the lodging resistance of rice stems. The actual lodging resistance of rice should be reflected in the overall thrust resistance of the crop itself [<xref rid="B22-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. With the development and application of crop models, crop growth patterns have shifted towards quantitative analysis, which has led to more attention being paid to the study of lodging models [<xref rid="B26-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. But model evaluation is usually based on some simplified assumptions. These assumptions may deviate from the actual situation, leading to uncertainty in the evaluation results. Meanwhile, model construction requires a large amount of data support. If the data is not comprehensive or accurate enough, it will affect the reliability of the evaluation results. In addition, the selection of parameters in model evaluation has a significant impact on the results. But sometimes the selection of these parameters may be subjective or based on experience. The credibility of the evaluation results is low. This results in the stem mechanics evaluation method still being the most widely used and effective evaluation method in practical applications. However, there is little research on the influence of rice panicle characteristic on rice lodging, as well as the correlation between rice panicle characteristic indicators and stem characteristic indicators.</p><p>Therefore, this study focuses on the lodging characteristics of six high-quality conventional rice varieties in the context of consumer demand for high-quality rice and frequent extreme weather events. Three varieties showed no lodging in the field, while three varieties experienced varying degrees of lodging. Based on field performance, we compared a range of main stem attributes, including the following: internode physical traits, stem and sheath plumpness, mechanical properties, yield-related traits, and panicle characteristics. The purpose is to (1) clarify the lodging resistance mechanism of high-quality conventional rice varieties; (2) search for key indicators to evaluate the lodging resistance of high-quality conventional rice, and (3) construct the relationship between panicle characteristic indicators and stem lodging indicators. The research ultimately provides theoretical reference for the breeding and production application of high-quality conventional rice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-14-02878"><title>2.

Plant Height and Internode Length</title><p>Both plant height and gravity center height of the lodging-resistant varieties were smaller than those of the lodging-susceptible varieties. Among them, the plant height of SY17 (R3) was significantly lower than JXSM (S1) by 9.61%, and gravity center height of NX42 (R1) was significantly lower than HGNZ (S2) by 16.10%. The difference in relative gravity center height between NX42 (R1) and HGNZ (S2) is also most significant. The former is significantly lower than the latter by 12.68% (<xref rid="plants-14-02878-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A&#8211;C). Further analysis of the internode length and panicle length of the main stem revealed that there was no significant difference in internode length between lodging-resistant and lodging-susceptible varieties for N3, N4, and N5 of the main stem. The internode length of the N2 on the main stem of lodging-resistant varieties is smaller than that of lodging-susceptible varieties.

Discussion</title><p>Nowadays, consumers&#8217; demand for nutrition, health, and food safety is becoming increasingly important. The cultivation of high-quality conventional rice is an indispensable choice to meet this demand. For breeding workers, this is also one of their important goals. However, the current complex and ever-changing climate has led to poor stability in factors such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall, posing severe challenges to the growth and development environment of rice. Rice lodging is one of the common phenomena that occur under extreme climate conditions. Once it occurs, it will not only make rice susceptible to pests and diseases but also affect nutrient absorption and photosynthesis during normal growth and development, seriously affecting the yield and quality of rice. The occurrence of lodging during the mature stage of rice will increase the difficulty of rice harvesting and increase yield losses. In case of rainy days or high humidity in the field, it is also easy to induce sprouting, decay, and deterioration on the panicle [<xref rid="B30-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The occurrence of lodging during the heading or filling stage will directly affect the formation of rice grains. Taking CY-6 and Liangyoupeijiu as examples, for every day that lodging occurs earlier, it will cause a yield loss of 2.71% and 2.66%, respectively. The grain setting rate decreased by 1.8% and 2.1%, and the thousand grain weight decreased by 0.32 g and 0.27 g. At the same time, the rice quality was also affected, and the taste quality decreased [<xref rid="B31-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. If the rice is in the early stages of growth, the rice stalks are not soft enough and suffer extreme weather collapse, and the rice cannot even be harvested [<xref rid="B32-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The same situation also occurs in wheat. The lodging during the heading and filling stages of wheat mainly causes an increase in infertile panicles, and a decrease in the grain number per panicle and in the thousand grain weight of winter wheat, which in turn leads to a decrease in yields. The lodging in the middle and late stages of grain filling mainly leads to a decrease in the thousand grain weight of winter wheat, while there is no significant change in the grain number per panicle [<xref rid="B33-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This study focused on six high-quality conventional rice varieties and measured the related indicators of stem characteristics and panicle characteristics of each variety in order to comprehensively evaluate the factors affecting lodging of high-quality conventional rice and accurately assess the lodging resistance of varieties.</p><p>The physical properties of rice stems directly affect the ability of rice to resist wind and lodging. The results of this study indicate that lodging-resistant varieties have relatively lower plant height, gravity center height, and relative gravity center height. Specifically, the plant height of lodging-resistant varieties is 4.11&#8211;16.10% lower than that of lodging varieties, the gravity center height is 0.83&#8211;9.61% lower than that of lodging varieties, and the relative gravity center height is 0.09&#8211;12.68% lower than that of lodging varieties. We further compared the physical characteristics of each internode. The results showed that the difference in internode length was mainly concentrated in the second internode at the base (N2). Specifically, the internode length of lodging-resistant varieties N2 is less than that of lodging-susceptible varieties by 8.96&#8211;44.69%. However, there was no significant difference in internode length and panicle length. The relevant research results also indicate that the N2 internodes at the base of rice are the main internodes for bearing weight, especially in high-plant-height rice [<xref rid="B34-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The cumulative results of N1-N2 and N3-N5 internodes still show that the length of N1-N2 internodes at the base of lodging-resistant varieties is smaller than that of lodging-susceptible varieties. This once again indicates that when improving the lodging resistance of rice varieties, the focus can be on the basal internodes. Reasonable internode length configuration can reduce the risk of rice lodging. In addition to genetic differences, factors affecting internode length changes include light intensity, leaf area, nitrogen application rate, and even the concentration of carbon dioxide in the environment [<xref rid="B20-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B35-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, the culm thickness and culm type index of the N1-to-N4 internodes at the base of the main stem were higher in lodging-resistant varieties than in lodging-susceptible varieties. But there was no significant difference in internode diameter. Tsugawa et al. found that there are differences in two traits among different cultivated varieties. One group of cultivated varieties has thicker but softer stems (thickness type), while another group of cultivated varieties has harder but thinner stems (hardness type). They refer to this change as the thickness&#8211;hardness trade-off. And a mechanical model was constructed to predict the lodging resistance of stems [<xref rid="B37-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, the lodging resistant varieties in this study may be the thickness type mentioned in the aforementioned research.</p><p>The leaf sheath of rice is an important component of rice growth and development. But its effect on rice lodging resistance is often overlooked. The leaf sheath can tightly wrap around the stem, providing support and protection. This helps with the normal growth of stems. At the same time, leaf sheath also have a certain mechanical strength, which can increase the wind resistance of rice plants [<xref rid="B38-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this study, the length of the N1-N2 internodes of lodging-resistant varieties was smaller than that of lodging-susceptible varieties, and the length of the N1-N2 leaf sheath of lodging-resistant varieties was also smaller than that of lodging-susceptible varieties. But the sheath phimosis degree is greater than that of the lodging-susceptible varieties. We guess that leaf sheaths provide some support for lodging-resistant varieties. Joseph Cornwall et al. also found in wheat that increasing the radial preload force of the stem and the frictional force between the leaf sheath and the stem will increase the bending strength and stiffness of the wheat stem. This further enhances the lodging resistance of wheat [<xref rid="B39-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Due to differences in stem and sheath length, culm thickness, and culm type index, there are also differences in the stem weight ratio and sheath weight ratio of N2 internodes at the base between lodging-resistant and lodging-susceptible varieties. Specifically, the N2 internodes at the base of lodging-resistant varieties are 16.37&#8211;268.58% heavier than the stem weight ratio of lodging-susceptible varieties, and 8.27&#8211;165.01% heavier than the sheath weight ratio of lodging-susceptible varieties. The research results of Zhang et al. also showed that although rice has a smaller stem thickness and thinner wall thickness, the dry weight of the leaf sheath per centimeter is larger, and the proportion of cellulose and lignin in the stem is higher, which enhances the stem strength of rice [<xref rid="B40-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Although there is no clear pattern in the section modulus between lodging-resistant and lodging-susceptible varieties, the bending stress and internode-breaking moment of each internode in the main stem show a trend of lodging-resistant varieties being greater than lodging-susceptible varieties. Researchers have also enhanced the mechanical strength of rice stems by improving their resistance to bending and breaking moments through reasonable nitrogen fertilizer treatment [<xref rid="B41-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Similar research is also reflected in the study of maize lodging resistance. Spraying ethylene can change the morphological characteristics of corn internodes and improve the stem strength of corn [<xref rid="B42-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Even results have shown that the structure of corn stems is more predictive of stem bending strength than their chemical composition [<xref rid="B43-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The plant-breaking moment is also a comprehensive indicator of the ability of rice to withstand their own external loads. Our results still show that the plant-breaking moment in N1&#8211;N3 of lodging-resistant varieties are greater than those of lodging-susceptible varieties. The lodging index reflects the strength of a plant&#8217;s ability to resist lodging. The smaller the lodging index, the stronger its ability to resist lodging [<xref rid="B24-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The lodging index in N1&#8211;N4 internodes of lodging-resistant varieties is lower than that of lodging-susceptible varieties. Therefore, we speculate that the stem mechanical properties of lodging-resistant varieties are better, with better strength and toughness to cope with lodging.</p><p>This study also compared the main stem yield and panicle traits of high-quality conventional rice varieties. The results showed that the effective panicles of lodging-resistant rice varieties were greater than those of lodging-susceptible varieties, while the panicle weight, grain numbers, and economic coefficient were lower than those of lodging-susceptible varieties. Varieties that experience lodging have higher panicle weight, grain numbers, and economic coefficient. Further analysis was conducted on the primary and secondary branch traits of the panicle. It is interesting that lodging-resistant varieties have higher primary and secondary stem grain setting rate and primary and secondary stem grain weight. Therefore, we speculate that lodging-resistant varieties have a more reasonable panicle structure. Although varieties with lodging have greater yield potential, improper panicle structure may make them more prone to lodging, directly affecting grain filling and maturation, and thus affecting yield formation. The study by E Santosa et al. also showed that if rice lodging occurs in the late stage of grain filling, the yield decreases by 10&#8211;20%. In the early stage of grouting, due to an increase in empty particles and a lower thousand particle weight, the yield will decrease by 50&#8211;60%, or even more severely [<xref rid="B44-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This brings up another contradiction. The improvement of rice yield requires an increase in plant height and an increase in biological yield to achieve the goal of increasing rice economic yield. But an increase in plant height and yield will increase the risk of lodging. Once lodging occurs, there is a possibility of reduced production. Some cultivators have proposed some cultivation measures to address this contradiction. The relevant measures include the application of silicon potassium fertilizer, and the use of calcium hexanedione and uniconazole, which can increase yield and reduce lodging risk [<xref rid="B45-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. By promoting preheading growth of rice to regulate biomass production and transport, lodging resistance can be improved while maintaining high yield [<xref rid="B46-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Maintain high rice yield and improve lodging resistance of rice plants through wet dry alternating irrigation method [<xref rid="B47-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Based on our results, we guess whether it is possible to reduce the risk of lodging while stabilizing overall yield by increasing effective panicles and reducing the panicle weight and grain numbers per panicle.</p><p>The correlation analysis results show that there is a significant or highly significant correlation between stem characteristic indicators and panicle characteristic indicators, including gravity center height, relative gravity center height, internode length, internode diameter, stem weight ratio, sheath weight ratio, bending moment, plant-breaking moment, and lodging index, etc. At the same time, principal component analysis based on these indicators distinguishes between lodging-resistant varieties and lodging-susceptible varieties. The research results of Li et al. showed that upright and semi upright panicle varieties have shorter plant height and shorter internodes at the base, which is more conducive to lodging resistance. Its panicles are short, light, and have a small curvature at the panicle neck, resulting in minimal force on the stem [<xref rid="B15-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. But it is not necessarily the case that curved panicle types have poorer lodging resistance than upright ear types. The panicle shape affects lodging resistance through bending moment and gravity center height. When the bending moment increases and the gravity center height rises, the resistance to lodging weakens, and vice versa, the resistance to lodging strengthens. Indica rice, especially large panicle hybrid indica rice, has a short panicle neck and drooping panicle. The curvature of the panicle neck is greater than 120&#176;, the gravity center height is reduced, and the bending moment is reduced, which is beneficial for improving lodging resistance [<xref rid="B48-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. So, the lodging resistance trait of rice is a complex characteristic involving stem and panicle characteristics. In research, close attention should be paid to the connection between the two. The membership function evaluation method is often used for comprehensive performance evaluation of optimal processing [<xref rid="B49-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. And cluster analysis is achieved by processing similar backgrounds within clustering analysis [<xref rid="B36-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B52-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This study comprehensively evaluated and classified six high-quality conventional rice varieties through membership function method and cluster analysis. The results showed that the membership functions of NX42 (R1), LD3 (R2), and SY17 (R3) were all greater than 0.60, and they were grouped together as low-risk lodging varieties. The membership function value of JXSM (S1) is 0.53, which is classified as a medium-risk variety for lodging. The membership functions of HGNZ (S2) and HGYZ (S3) are both greater than 0.30, and they are grouped together as high-risk varieties for lodging.</p><p>This study explores the relationship between lodging and material heritability in rice. But related studies also indicate that agronomic measures play an important role in improving rice lodging resistance. By regulating water management (such as alternating wet and dry irrigation), fertilization management (such as nitrogen fertilizer application), and cultivation techniques (such as reasonable planting and timely sun drying), the lodging resistance of rice can be significantly improved [<xref rid="B54-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. For example, compared to the drought flood alternation stress treatment during the tillering stage, the drought flood alternation stress treatment during the jointing stage can reduce the photosynthetic capacity of post-flowering leaves and rice panicle weight. This will improve the plumpness of the stem and increase the safety factor of stem lodging resistance [<xref rid="B47-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, the application of growth regulators such as paclobutrazol has been shown to enhance the lodging resistance of rice [<xref rid="B57-plants-14-02878" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Therefore, future research should further explore the interaction between agronomic measures and genetic factors to achieve comprehensive improvement of rice lodging resistance. This not only helps to improve the yield and quality of rice but also provides theoretical support for rice lodging resistance breeding and cultivation management.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-plants-14-02878"><title>4.

The selected varieties are all high-quality conventional rice varieties widely planted in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. All varieties are excellent cultivated species approved by the national or provincial authorities. All seeds were provided by the Rice Research Institute of Hunan Agricultural University. The varieties showed non-lodging in R1&#8211;R3 and lodging in S1-S1 at 30 days after full heading. Each variety&#8217;s main stem contains the same six specific parts: five internodes (numbered N1 to N5 from base to top) and one panicle (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-plants-14-02878"><title>4.2.

Basic physical and chemical properties of soil in the cultivated layer (0&#8211;20 cm) of the experimental site: organic matter is 31.2 g/kg, total nitrogen is 0.3 g/kg, total phosphorus is 0.6 g/kg, available phosphorus is 10.2 mg/kg, available potassium is 216.5 mg/kg, available nitrogen is 385.5 mg/kg, pH is 5.3. The monthly average temperature and average rainfall in the relevant experimental area are shown in <xref rid="plants-14-02878-f012" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>. The plot area of each variety was set at 80 m<sup>2</sup>. Each variety has three replicates, and each experimental unit is arranged in random block. Adopt manual transplanting method to transplant the seedlings at 25 days of age. Transplant density is 25 cm &#215; 14 cm. The fertilizer program was nitrogen fertilizer (150 kg&#183;hm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>) applied in stages as base fertilizer: tiller fertilizer: panicle fertilizer = 4:3:3. Phosphorus fertilizer (75 kg&#183;hm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>) was applied in full as basal fertilizer. Potassium fertilizer (75 kg&#183;hm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>) is applied with 50% base fertilizer and 50% panicle fertilizer. Field management measures are implemented according to local high-yield cultivation requirements. At the heading stage, mark 30 main stems with consistent panicles by hanging tags. At 30 days after heading, 20 main stems with uniform panicle were collected from the labeled plants in each plot. Investigate the main stem internode physical traits, stem and sheath plumpness traits, main stem mechanical properties, and lodging resistance-related indicators. In addition, the number of effective panicles in 6 varieties with consistent growth was investigated during the rice maturity period.

Conclusions</title><p>Lodging-resistant high-quality conventional rice varieties had a more reasonable internode structure, lower plant height, gravity center height, and relative gravity center height, shorter and thicker N2 internode morphology, higher sheath phimosis degree, harder bending stress, internode-breaking moment, plant-breaking moment, and smaller lodging index compared to lodging-susceptible high-quality conventional rice varieties. However, research on lodging resistance characteristics still needs to focus on rice panicle traits. In this study, the effective panicles of lodging-resistant varieties were greater than those of lodging-susceptible varieties, while the panicle weight, grain numbers, and economic coefficient were lower than those of lodging-susceptible varieties. We guess whether it is possible to reduce the risk of lodging while stabilizing overall yield by increasing effective panicles and reducing the panicle weight and grain numbers per panicle. In addition, the lodging performance of the varieties obtained through membership function evaluation and cluster analysis in this study is consistent with the actual field performance. The membership function evaluation and cluster analysis can be used as analytical methods for evaluating the lodging resistance of high-quality conventional rice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Chuge Yan, Ling Liu, and Xin Shu at Hunan Agricultural University for all their help during the experiment.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
