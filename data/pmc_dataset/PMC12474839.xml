Two major pathological subtypes exist: oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and oesophageal adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The oesophagus is an unusual site for metastasis because of its unique anatomical and physiological characteristics. When metastases occur in the oesophagus, they are most often from breast, lung, or melanoma primary tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Metastasis of prostate cancer is exceptional and typically occurs via lymphatic or haematogenous spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with only a few cases reported in the literature.</p><p id="Par5">Prostate cancer is among the most common malignancies in men and is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It typically metastasises to the bone, lymph nodes, liver, and lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Visceral metastases are less common and often indicate advanced-stage disease.</p><p id="Par6">Clinically, oesophageal metastases often are asymptomatic or present with nonspecific symptoms such as dysphagia, chest discomfort, or weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, a diagnosis of oesophageal metastasis of prostate cancer often relies on a combination of imaging, histopathological evaluation, and immunohistochemical staining. Markers such as PSA, PSAP, P504S, and NKX3.1 (NK3 homeobox 1) are crucial for confirming the prostatic origin of metastatic lesions in unusual locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. </p><p id="Par7">Here, we present a rare case of oesophageal metastasis of prostate cancer confirmed by immunohistochemistry, including positive staining for P504S and AR.

He refused a prostate biopsy and systemic therapy, including hormone or radiation therapy, for personal reasons. This may have contributed to the widespread metastatic presentation observed at the time of admission.</p><p id="Par20">After admission, comprehensive examinations were conducted. The patient was treated with Bifidobacterium triple live capsules to regulate the intestinal flora, along with anti-infective and symptomatic supportive therapy. Imaging revealed a malignant prostate tumour with multiple metastases, and elevated PSA levels were noted. A urology consultation was requested. Because the patient tested positive for syphilis, dermatology and venereology consultations were conducted. Routine treatment and regular follow-up were recommended; however, the patient refused treatment. Owing to elevated PSA levels, prostate cancer was suspected, and the patient was transferred to the Department of Urology for further evaluation and treatment. Although a prostate biopsy was recommended to confirm the diagnosis, the patient declined the procedure. After detailed discussions with the patient and his family, subcutaneous endocrine therapy with goserelin (3.6&#160;mg every 28 days) was initiated. The timeline of the patient&#8217;s treatment process during therapy is shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.

After the first course of chemotherapy, the patient&#8217;s clinical symptoms improved, and the repeated tumour marker evaluation results improved.

The patient was still alive after 6 months of follow-up examinations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par23">
Prostate cancer is a common malignancy in men, with a well-established pattern of metastasis predominantly involving the bones, lymph nodes, lungs, and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Metastasis to the oesophagus is exceptionally rare, with few cases reported worldwide. Epidemiological studies suggest that gastrointestinal involvement occurs in less than 2% of prostate cancer patients, and oesophageal metastasis constitutes an even smaller fraction of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">
The oesophagus is an extremely rare site of prostate cancer metastasis, and its involvement is often explained through atypical metastatic pathways. Haematogenous spread is a plausible mechanism, particularly via the vertebral venous plexus (Batson&#8217;s plexus), which allows retrograde tumour cell dissemination, bypassing the pulmonary circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additionally, lymphatic spread may contribute, especially in patients with extensive pelvic and para-aortic lymph node involvement, where tumour cells may eventually reach mediastinal or periesophageal lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In this case report, the patient&#8217;s abdominal CT examination indicated multiple areas of destruction of the ribs and vertebral bone, multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneal membrane (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and B), and multiple instances of lymph node metastasis in the abdominal aorta. Enhanced MR images of the bilateral iliac vessels of the prostate are shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C and D.</p><p id="Par25">
Another proposed factor is organotropism&#8212;the tendency of certain tumour cells to preferentially metastasise to specific organs due to molecular affinity between tumour surface receptors and tissue-specific ligands. However, prostate cancer cells typically lack tropism for oesophageal tissue, which partially explains the rarity of such metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In most reported cases, oesophageal involvement presents as submucosal lesions rather than mucosal ulcerations, suggesting secondary infiltration rather than primary colonisation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">
Differentiating metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma from primary oesophageal carcinoma is a crucial diagnostic step, especially in cases in which the metastatic lesion presents with poorly differentiated morphology or mimics a primary oesophageal tumour. Routine imaging and histopathology may not be sufficient for an accurate diagnosis; thus, IHC becomes essential.</p><p id="Par27">
Immunohistochemical markers play a vital role in confirming the prostatic origin of metastatic tumours, particularly when the morphology is ambiguous or when traditional markers such as PSA level are equivocal. Among these, AR and P504S have emerged as important adjunct markers in the pathological evaluation of prostate cancer.</p><p id="Par28">
AR is a nuclear transcription factor highly expressed in most prostate adenocarcinomas, reflecting the hormone-dependent nature of the disease. Its immunoreactivity supports a diagnosis of prostate cancer, especially in hormone-sensitive tumours.</p><p id="Par29">
P504S, a prostate-specific transmembrane protein, is localised to the Golgi apparatus. It demonstrates high specificity for prostate tissue and is typically retained even in poorly differentiated tumours or in metastatic settings where PSA expression may be lost. In addition to immunohistochemical staining, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for PSA mRNA can serve as a highly sensitive diagnostic tool, especially when immunohistochemical markers are inconclusive. The presence of PSA-positive mRNA in metastatic lesions, including oesophageal tumours, has been revealed in previous studies, further confirming the prostatic origin of such lesions.</p><p id="Par30">
PSA is the most used marker for prostate adenocarcinoma, especially in patients presenting with obstructive urinary symptoms. While markedly elevated PSA levels are strongly suggestive of malignancy, it is important to note that certain cases have been reported with normal serum PSA levels despite histologically confirmed prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">
In clinical practice, a panel-based approach utilising PSA, AR, and P504S enhances diagnostic accuracy in identifying metastatic prostate cancer. The coexpression of AR and P504S, along with the absence of gastrointestinal or squamous epithelial markers (e.g., CK7, CDX2, p63), strongly favours a prostatic origin, particularly in unusual metastatic sites such as the oesophagus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this case, RA (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B) and P504S (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C) are active.</p><p id="Par32">
Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma typically expresses CK5 and p63, which indicate squamous differentiation. These markers are highly sensitive and help distinguish ESCC from adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma is typically positive for CK7 and, occasionally, CK20, reflecting an intestinal-type glandular origin. We checked that the ICH (F) was negative in this case. However, in this case, IHC revealed that the expression of CK5 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D), p63 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E) and CK7 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F) was negative. Therefore, this distinct immunoprofile helps differentiate primary oesophageal tumours from metastatic prostate cancer.</p><p id="Par33">
Patients often report vague gastrointestinal symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, or chest discomfort, which can be easily misattributed to primary oesophageal pathologies or benign conditions. Radiological imaging, including CT and PET-CT, may reveal oesophageal wall thickening or mediastinal involvement but cannot reliably differentiate between primary and secondary malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Hence, an endoscopic biopsy with immunohistochemical staining is essential for obtaining a definitive diagnosis.</p><p id="Par34">
After standardised treatment, individualised monitoring is needed. Serial PSA measurements and periodic imaging studies are generally used to evaluate treatment response and to detect disease progression. Thus, clinicians must remain suspicious of metastasis to unusual sites in prostate cancer patients who present with gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly those with a high tumour burden or treatment-resistant disease.</p><p id="Par35">This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving urologists, gastroenterologists, and pathologists in ensuring an accurate diagnosis and optimal management.</p><p id="Par36">Differentiating between primary oesophageal carcinoma and metastatic prostate cancer is crucial for an accurate diagnosis. These two conditions have distinct origins and biological behaviours and require different treatment approaches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par37">Improving clinicians&#8217; awareness of metastatic sites of prostate cancer and exploring metastatic pathways could help guide identification methods, treatment decisions, and follow-up strategies. Increased awareness of such rare metastatic patterns can help avoid misdiagnosis, prevent unnecessary interventions, and facilitate the timely initiation of appropriate systemic therapy, ultimately improving clinical outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Core tip</title><p id="Par38">
This report describes a case of prostate cancer metastasising to the oesophagus. Breast cancer, lung cancer, and malignant melanoma a very common metastases of metastatic oesophageal cancer. HE staining and IHC revealed positive expression of P504S and AR, confirming the diagnosis of oesophageal metastasis from prostate cancer. Based on this case, we speculate that the patient&#8217;s metastatic oesophageal lesion may have originated from retroperitoneal lymph node metastases secondary to prostate cancer, followed by further spread to the oesophagus. Alternatively, direct lymphatic spread to the oesophagus cannot be excluded.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>
