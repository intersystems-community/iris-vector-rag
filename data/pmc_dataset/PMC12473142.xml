Excessive melanin leads to hyperpigmentation, while UVA radiation accelerates skin aging and oxidative stress. This study investigated the multi-functional dermatological potential of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> strain LS-derived cell-free supernatant (CFS-LS) to address these concerns. Our findings demonstrate that CFS-LS effectively inhibits melanogenesis in B16F10 cells. It significantly reduced &#945;-MSH-induced melanin synthesis, comparable to arbutin, by downregulating key melanogenic enzymes (tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2) and regulatory proteins (p-CREB, MITF, SOX9, and SOX10). Mechanistically, CFS-LS suppressed the phosphorylation of MEK, ERK, p38, and JNK, indicating a dual inhibitory effect on both PKA/CREB and MAPK pathways. Furthermore, CFS-LS mitigated UVA-induced photodamage in HaCaT cells by significantly reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species and suppressing the downstream phosphorylation of p53 and &#945;-MSH levels. It also restored UVA-suppressed Nrf-2 and HO-1 expression, enhancing cellular antioxidant defenses. Lastly, CFS-LS promoted skin wound healing by significantly enhancing HaCaT cell migration in a scratch assay, associated with increased p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 levels, and notably elevated collagen type I synthesis. Collectively, these results highlight CFS-LS as a potent multi-functional agent for skin protection and repair, with significant potential for cosmetic and therapeutic applications. The active components of CFS-LS warrant further investigation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Pediococcus acidophilus</italic> LS</kwd><kwd>cell-free supernatant</kwd><kwd>melanogenesis</kwd><kwd>photodamage</kwd><kwd>wound healing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Tainan Municipal Hospital</funding-source><award-id>RD-113003</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>China Medical University-affiliated hospital, Taiwan</funding-source><award-id>DMR-109-162</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by grants from the Tainan Municipal Hospital (RD-113003) and China Medical University-affiliated hospital, Taiwan (DMR-109-162).</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-microorganisms-13-02207"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Skin, hair, and eye color in mammals are mainly determined by melanin produced in the basal epidermis by melanocytes, which transfer the melanin to keratinocytes, forming the epidermal melanin unit [<xref rid="B1-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Melanin protects the skin by absorbing ultraviolet (UV) radiation, preventing UV-induced damage [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, excessive melanin causes skin aging, such as freckles and age spots, and increases melanoma risk [<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. UVA radiation, which constitutes 90&#8211;99% of UV reaching the Earth [<xref rid="B5-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], penetrates deep into the dermis, damaging collagen and elastic fibers, stimulating melanin production, and accelerating skin aging [<xref rid="B6-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. UVA induces reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing oxidative DNA damage [<xref rid="B7-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>UV exposure elevates p53 in keratinocytes, promoting expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), which is cleaved into &#945;-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (&#945;-MSH). &#945;-MSH binds melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) on melanocytes, increasing cAMP and activating protein kinase A (PKA). This leads to the upregulation of CREB and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which drives the expression of melanogenic enzymes such as tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related proteins (TRP-1 and TRP-2), resulting in melanin synthesis [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B9-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Repeated exposure to UV radiation is a primary cause of premature skin aging and increased risk of malignant skin cancers [<xref rid="B10-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To combat these issues, a major focus has been placed on reducing hyperpigmentation and oxidative damage. Traditional tyrosinase inhibitors, such as hydroquinone, kojic acid, and arbutin, are widely used for this purpose. However, their application is limited by concerns regarding carcinogenicity, instability, and a lack of clear mechanistic understanding [<xref rid="B11-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel, safe, and effective compounds with both anti-aging and anti-pigmentation properties.</p><p>In recent years, probiotic bacterial cell-free supernatants&#8212;filtered fluids containing bacterial metabolites but no live cells&#8212;have emerged as promising postbiotics that benefit skin health by reducing aging and pigmentation. These bioactive effects are mainly due to a complex mix of metabolites like organic acids, peptides, and phenolic derivatives produced by lactic acid bacteria [<xref rid="B13-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For instance, studies have shown that supernatants from strains like <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Pediococcus acidilactici</italic> exhibit anti-melanogenic and antioxidant activities [<xref rid="B14-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, the specific active compounds responsible for these effects remain unidentified. Thus, while the benefits are evident, the precise active ingredients remain largely unidentified.</p><p>Considering the established roles of postbiotics in skin protection, the potential of <italic toggle="yes">Pediococcus acidophilus</italic> strain LS-derived cell-free supernatant (CFS-LS) to reduce UV-induced photodamage, downregulate melanogenesis, and facilitate wound healing was evaluated. This study examined the effects of CFS-LS on melanogenesis-related signaling in B16F10 cells, antioxidant responses in UVA-irradiated HaCaT cells, and re-epithelialization processes in a scratch wound model. The results provide insight into the potential use of CFS-LS as a multi-functional agent for skin protection and repair.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-microorganisms-13-02207"><title>2.

After treatment, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 20 min at room temperature. Following fixation, cells were gently washed three times with PBS to remove residual fixative. The Fontana&#8211;Masson staining was performed using a Fontana&#8211;Masson Stain Kit (ScyTek Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA), according to the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol with modifications to ensure optimal staining. Briefly, 200 &#181;L of freshly prepared ammoniacal silver solution, pre-warmed to 60 &#176;C, was added to each well. The plates were incubated in a humidified chamber at 60 &#176;C for approximately 30 min or until a yellowish-brown coloration developed, indicating silver impregnation. During incubation, care was taken to prevent the solution from drying out by maintaining sufficient humidity. Following silver impregnation, the cells were rinsed gently three times with distilled water, with each wash lasting 1 min. Subsequently, 200 &#181;L of 0.2% gold chloride solution was applied for 30 s at room temperature to tone the silver deposits. The cells were again washed three times with distilled water. To fix the silver deposits and reduce background staining, 200 &#181;L of 5% sodium thiosulfate solution was added for 1 min, followed by three washes with distilled water. A final wash was performed under running tap water for 2 min to thoroughly remove residual reagents. Cells were then counterstained with 200 &#181;L of Nuclear Fast Red for 5 min at room temperature to visualize nuclei. After counterstaining, the slides were washed three times with distilled water. Dehydration was carried out rapidly through two changes of 95% ethanol (1 min each), followed by absolute ethanol for three changes of 1 min each. Finally, the stained samples were mounted with a synthetic resin mounting medium. Under microscopic examination, melanin and argentaffin granules appeared as black deposits, whereas nuclei were stained red.

CFS-LS demonstrated strong anti-melanogenic potential by significantly inhibiting &#945;-MSH-induced melanin synthesis, an effect comparable to arbutin. This reduction in melanin content is mechanistically supported by CFS-LS&#8217;s ability to downregulate crucial melanogenic enzymes such as tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2. Furthermore, CFS-LS inhibited the expression of p-CREB and MITF, the master regulator of melanogenesis, along with its cooperative transcription factors SOX9 and SOX10 [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B9-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B34-microorganisms-13-02207" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
