Among these, the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein is of particular interest due to its role in degrading tumor suppressor proteins such as p53, thus contributing to oncogenesis.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Recent studies have identified specific mutations within the HPV16 E6 gene that may influence its oncogenic potential. One such mutation, the T350G single nucleotide polymorphism, results in an amino acid substitution in the E6 protein and has been found to occur frequently in cervical cancer tissues.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This mutation may alter the interaction of the E6 protein with its cellular targets, potentially affecting processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and transformation.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, the clinical implications of this mutation remain unclear. Understanding the functional consequences of the HPV16 E6 T350G mutation is critical, as it may provide insights into mechanisms of cancer progression and identify potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets. The selection of this mutation for study is based on its reported prevalence in cervical cancer tissues and its suspected role in altering E6 protein function, highlighting its potential as a key driver in cervical carcinogenesis.</p><p>Additionally, neurotrophic factors in the tumor microenvironment, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are gaining attention for their roles in tumorigenesis.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> BDNF, known for its functions in neuronal survival and differentiation, has been implicated in the proliferation and progression of various cancers, including cervical cancer.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> BDNF can activate multiple signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, which in turn modulates downstream molecules like p53.

Comparative analysis of molecular and cellular differences between CIN I and cervical cancer tissues can provide valuable insights into the progression from benign lesions to malignancy.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Therefore, this study focuses on the role of the HPV16 E6 T350G mutation in regulating BDNF expression and its subsequent impact on cell proliferation in cervical cancer and CIN I.

Screening for HPV16 E6 T350G mutations in clinical settings could enable risk stratification and facilitate personalized treatment strategies.

First, the experiments were conducted in vitro, which may not fully capture the complexity of in vivo tumor development. Animal models or patient-derived xenografts could be used to validate these findings and explore the tumor microenvironment&#8217;s role. Second, this study focused on the HPV16 E6 T350G mutation in isolation, neglecting potential interactions with other HPV genes, such as E7, or host genetic variations. Further studies could investigate the combined effects of E6 and E7 mutations on cervical carcinogenesis. Third, while the study explored the PI3K/AKT pathway, additional downstream targets of BDNF or alternative signaling pathways may contribute to the observed effects. Investigating these pathways could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mutation&#8217;s role in cervical cancer. Lastly, the lack of clinical data limits the study&#8217;s translational potential. Larger cohort studies with clinical samples are needed to validate the findings and assess their relevance in diverse populations.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-s2002"><title>Broader Impact</title><p>This study contributes to the growing body of evidence linking HPV genetic variations to cervical cancer progression.
