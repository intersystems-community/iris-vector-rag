An effective vaccine is urgently needed. Germline-targeting immunogens show promise in initiating broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) precursors. This study developed a scalable, cGMP-compliant process to manufacture the HIV vaccine booster immunogen HxB2.WT.Core-C4b, a nanoparticle designed to direct bNAb precursor maturation after priming. Methods: A CHO cell platform was established through single-cell cloning from a high-producing stable pool. Upstream and downstream processes were optimized for scalability and yield. Three scales were tested 10 L, 40 L, and 400 L. Key parameters (pH, temperature, feeding, metabolite profiles) were systematically refined. Analytical characterization included glycosylation profiling, electron microscopy, and antigenicity testing. Viral clearance was evaluated per ICH Q5A guidelines. Results: Optimization ensured consistent yields above 130 mg/L, with titers up to 250 mg/L. The selected clone (4E22) demonstrated strong growth, viability, and reproducibility. Glycan occupancy at 18 N-linked sites, including bNAb epitopes (N276, N332), was stable across scales. Over 70% of self-assembling nanoparticle were fully assembled at the GMP level. Antigenicity and purity met cGMP release criteria. Viral clearance achieved &gt;13-log reduction for enveloped and &gt;7-log for non-enveloped viruses. Conclusions: This work establishes a robust, scalable platform for HIV nanoparticle immunogens. Consistent quality and yield across scales support clinical development of HxB2.WT.Core-C4b and provide a model for other glycosylated nanoparticle vaccines. The immunogen is being evaluated in clinical study HVTN 320 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT06796686">NCT06796686</ext-link>), enabling early testing of next-generation vaccines designed to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HIV vaccines</kwd><kwd>clinical trial material</kwd><kwd>GMP</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</funding-source><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source><funding-source>Department of Health and Human Services</funding-source><award-id>75N93022D00005</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded in whole or in part with federal funds from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, and Department of Health and Human Services under Contract No. 75N93022D00005.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-13-00980"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a persistent global health threat, with an estimated 39.9 million people living with the virus and approximately 630,000 HIV-related deaths recorded in 2023 alone [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite substantial progress in antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prevention strategies, more than one million new infections continue to occur annually, underscoring the urgent need for an effective vaccine. ART has transformed HIV from a fatal disease into a manageable chronic condition; however, it requires lifelong adherence, poses economic and logistical challenges, and does not eliminate the risk of viral transmission or latent reservoir reactivation [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The development of an HIV vaccine has been a major scientific objective, and multiple approaches have been investigated, including subunit proteins, viral vectors, and DNA- and mRNA-based platforms, with varying levels of success [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Notably, recent advances in germline-targeting immunogen design have demonstrated feasible approaches for guiding B cell responses toward broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) precursors [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The HxB2.WT.Core-C4b self-assembling nanoparticle immunogen evaluated in this study was designed as a nanoparticle-displayed, heterologous booster for the germline-targeting priming immunogen 426c.Mod.Core-C4b. The HxB2.WT.Core-C4b that is glycosylated at the conserved N-linked glycosylation site at position 276 in Loop D and at position 463 in V5, does not activate na&#239;ve VRC01-class B cells, but plays a crucial role in guiding antibody maturation efficiently by selecting and expanding key somatic mutations when employed as a first booster, facilitating downstream development of bNAbs [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The selection of HxB2.WT.Core-C4b as a &#8220;booster&#8221; immunogen is based on extensive preliminary experimentation [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We have shown that we can efficiently activate na&#239;ve B cells expressing germline (unmutated) VRC01-class BCRs in vivo, by employing the germline-targeting immunogen 426c.Mod.Core-C4b. This activation leads to the accumulation of somatic mutations in the VRC01-class BCRs. Some of these mutations allow the partially mutated BCRs to bypass the N276-associated glycans in Loop D, which represent the major obstacle in the activation and maturation of VRC01-class antibodies. HxB2.WT.Core-C4b is optimal in selecting the BCRs with these binding properties (even though itself does not activate na&#239;ve VRC01-class B cells) and furthering their maturation through the accumulation of additional somatic mutations [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The accumulation of additional somatic mutations will accelerate the elicitation of protective broadly neutralizing VRC01-class antibodies through vaccination.</p><p>Parallel to antigen design, manufacturing technologies for HIV vaccines must meet current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) standards while supporting flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency; this is especially critical for low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). While mRNA and viral vector vaccines have demonstrated rapid scalability, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, protein-based nanoparticle vaccines offer advantages in thermostability, safety profile, and the potential for multivalent display [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, scalable and regulatory-compliant production of nanoparticle-based immunogens remains a technical hurdle, such as batch-to-batch consistency, assembly efficiency, and high yields.</p><p>This article provides a comprehensive assessment of a scalable, cGMP-compatible process for producing the nanoparticle-based HIV vaccine candidate HxB2.WT.Core-C4b. Initial collaborative work on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) stable pool cell line development to generate an MCB and process development for manufacturing was conducted by the Duke Human Vaccine Institute (DHVI). It demonstrated effective cell culture media for upstream processes and established purification columns and filtration systems for downstream processing. Building on this, our study describes the next critical steps, including the establishment of a high-yield monoclonal CHO cell line, optimization of upstream and downstream processes, and successful 40-fold scale-up to achieve a cGMP-compliant manufacturing process. This work aims to support the cost-effective and accelerated development of heterologous boosting immunogens for germline-targeting HIV vaccines, providing a template for the broader application of nanoparticle technologies in infectious disease immunization programs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-13-00980"><title>2.

Stable Clone Generation</title><p>A previously generated MCB based on a stable cell pool of HxB2.WT.Core-C4b-expressing CHO cells was subjected to single-cell subcloning by limiting dilution in 384-well plates (Corning). Clonality of individual wells was confirmed using a Solentim Cell Metric automated plate imaging system (Advanced Instruments), and clones with robust growth were expanded stepwise from microplates to shake flasks (Corning). Product expression was assessed by ELISA at the 96-well stage, and the clones with the highest titers were further characterized.</p><p>Top-performing subclones were adapted to agitated culture conditions in 50 mL TubeSpin<sup>&#174;</sup> Bioreactor tubes (TPP) and evaluated for cell growth, viability, and productivity across multiple passages. Cell-specific productivity (qp) and growth rate (&#181;) were determined, and selected subclones were cryopreserved as research cell banks (RCBs). From these, the three highest-performing clones (designated CHO/HXB2C/4E22/RCB, CHO/HXB2C/9K21/RCB, and CHO/HXB2C/5C9/RCB) were advanced to bioreactor-scale evaluation. Comparative analysis of productivity and product quality identified clone 4E22 as the most promising candidate. Based on these results, a new master cell bank (CHO/HXB2C/4E22/MCB) was established from clone 4E22 and used for process verification and subsequent cGMP manufacturing runs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-vaccines-13-00980"><title>2.2. Inoculum Preparation and Bioreactor Operation</title><p>Inoculum preparation began by thawing RCB or MCB vials of liquid nitrogen cryopreserved cell stocks (1 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup> cells per vial) under a laminar hood, transfer of the entire cell stock (~1 mL) to 10 mL of cold OptiCHO medium (2&#8211;8 &#176;C), and then centrifuging at 170 &#177; 10 g for 10 min. The supernatant was then discarded in order to remove residual freezing medium and cell pellets were resuspended in pre-warmed (37 &#176;C) OptiCHO medium, transferred to 125 mL shake flasks (Corning), and cultured in an incubator shaker (Kuhner) at 125 rpm, 37 &#176;C, and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Inoculum cultures for the bioreactors were prepared through periodic passaging of cultures every 3&#8211;4 days including monitoring of cell growth and viability as described under <xref rid="sec2dot6dot1-vaccines-13-00980" ref-type="sec">Section 2.6.1</xref> and gradually scaling up to 1 L shake flasks. Once a sufficiently high total cell count was obtained for inoculation of bioreactors at a starting cell density of &#8805;0.5 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL, cultures were then transferred to glass bottles for sterile connection to the bioreactor system.</p><p>Bioreactor cultivation was carried out in continuous stirred-tank bioreactors, using R&#8217;ALF bioreactors (Bioengineering) with total volumes of 6&#8211;7 L (working volume 2&#8211;4.5 L) or 15 L (working volume 6&#8211;10 L). Each bioreactor was equipped with probes for pH, pO<sub>2</sub>, and temperature, along with aeration via headspace, sparger, or microsparger. The process control system managed all parameters. pH was monitored using gel electrodes (Mettler Toledo), initially set at 7.00 and later adjusted to 6.95 or 6.80, with a maximum dead band control of &#177;0.15 units. A proportional&#8211;integral (PI) control loop was used to regulate the addition of corrective CO<sub>2</sub>, delivered either through direct sparging or by adding 1 M sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). Dissolved oxygen levels (pO<sub>2</sub>) were monitored with amperometric electrodes (Mettler Toledo). For routine cultivation, pO<sub>2</sub> was maintained at 40% air saturation using a PI control loop by sparging pure oxygen into the culture, supplementing the baseline gas mixture.</p><p>The temperature was maintained at 37 &#177; 0.2 &#176;C, and the stirrer speed was adjusted according to the reactor size, with a standard setting of 150 rpm for R&#8217;ALF cultivations. No antifoam solution was needed due to minimal foaming. Cells were inoculated into OptiCHO basal media (supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine, without methotrexate (MTX)) at a density of &#8805;5 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL, with daily addition of 3 &#215; Efficient Feed &#8482; A + at 1% of the initial working volume from day 3 to 12. The glucose concentration was maintained at &#8805;2 g/L and supplemented as needed. Developmental adaptations included the use of glucose-enriched feed (120 g/L) to eliminate the need for a separate feed line. Cultures were terminated and harvested at &#8805;80% viability, targeting a 14-day process time.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-vaccines-13-00980"><title>2.3.

Effects of pH and Base Addition</title><p>Initially, an existing fed-batch protocol was used for a 2 L scale fermentation run. Additional cell culture runs were performed in sets of three parallel bioreactors to explore different conditions during cultivation, such as the effect of pH control through base addition at various pH levels, and to gather information about viability progression in the later process phase. Additionally, two bioreactor runs at an 8&#8211;10 L scale were carried out to produce more material for downstream processing (DSP) development and to evaluate the impact of using different bioreactors. An overview of these experiments, along with benchmark data, is provided in <xref rid="vaccines-13-00980-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Bioreactors F977 to F979 were operated in parallel, each starting from the same inoculum culture. F981 was initiated from the same inoculum culture as the small-scale runs F982&#8211;F984, while F985 was completed independently with a separate inoculum culture.</p><p>Growth and Viability Trends: The maximum cell concentrations across all runs ranged from 8.7 to 13.2 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Runs with base addition for pH control (F978, F979, and F984) showed slightly reduced growth compared to other runs, but there was no noticeable effect on viability progression. Extending cultures beyond the 80% viability threshold provided insights into the robustness of the cell line, revealing a relatively slow decline in viability across all processes.</p><p>Product Formation and Yield Variation: Differences in product formation were observed among the different runs. In the first series of cell culture runs (F977&#8211;F979), the runs with base addition (F978 and F979) resulted in product yields of approximately 40&#8211;50 mg/L when harvested at 80% viability, whereas the run without base addition (F977) yielded 81 mg/L at 87% viability. The second cell culture series (F982&#8211;F984) reinforced this observation. While F984 (with base addition) remained comparable to runs F978 and F979, runs F982 and F983 outperformed all previous runs, demonstrating the potential for product yields exceeding 100 mg/L, with some reaching up to 200 mg/L.</p><p>Metabolic Shifts and pH Control Effects: A clear link was found between pH control through base addition and lactate metabolism. In processes without base addition (F977, F982, and F983), cells switched to consuming lactate after reaching peak concentrations of about 2 g/L between days 4 and 6. Conversely, processes with base addition for pH adjustment (F978, F979) exhibited continuous lactate buildup throughout, whereas a reduced base addition strategy (F984) resulted in lactate levels stabilizing at around 3 g/L.</p><p>Glucose Utilization and Nutrient Dynamics: Since the fed-batch protocol follows a fixed feeding schedule, glucose levels during the process depend on cell culture performance. An overfeeding event was observed on day 4 of the process F983, but overall, glucose concentrations between 2 and 6 g/L were within an acceptable range and did not negatively impact process performance. No limitations in cell-specific glucose levels were observed in any of the processes. Trends for glutamine and ammonium concentrations were similar across all processes, with minor differences. Cultures maintained at lower pH levels appeared to produce more energy from glutamine, resulting in higher ammonia levels during fed-batch cultivation. However, ammonia concentrations exceeding 5 mmol/L NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> were only seen during the late phases of the process when viability was already declining and did not adversely affect the cultures.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot2-vaccines-13-00980"><title>3.1.2. Effect of Temperature</title><p>A series of temperature-shift experiments was conducted using the standard feeding regimen and a fixed pH setpoint of 6.80 to evaluate the effect of reduced temperatures on growth and productivity. Temperature shifts to 33 &#176;C, 34 &#176;C, and 36 &#176;C were applied during the late exponential phase. The goal was to determine whether lower temperatures could sustain high product yields while decreasing by-product formation and oxygen consumption, potentially facilitating process scale-up. <xref rid="vaccines-13-00980-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes the experimental conditions and results.

Cell growth and productivity declined slightly in the temperature-shifted cultures compared to the control and previous 37 &#176;C processes. Lower temperatures during fed-batch resulted in acceptable yields, but reducing the temperature to 33 &#176;C did not significantly improve by-product formation or viability progression.

Subcloning, evaluation, and selection focused on stable growth, productivity, and product quality.</p><p>Subclone Generation and Evaluation: Single-cell subcloning was carried out through limiting dilution into 384-well plates, with clonality confirmed using the Cell Metric imaging system. Clones exhibiting strong growth were expanded to 96-well plates. At this stage, supernatants were analyzed by ELISA for product concentration, and confluency data from the Cell Metric system were used to identify the most promising clones. Initially, sixty monoclonal subclones were expanded, and from these, 25 were selected based on expression and growth performance for further testing in 50 mL culture tubes.</p><p>Selection of Top Subclones: Routine cultivation data (growth, viability, and productivity) from tube cultures were used to narrow down the panel to ten high-performing subclones. These were adapted to 125 mL shaker flasks and underwent further evaluation, including long-term culture stability, product concentration by ELISA, and fed-batch performance. Research cell banks (RCBs) were created for all ten subclones through cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>Fed-Batch Cultivation and Lead Clone Selection: The ten subclones were tested in fed-batch shake flask experiments, where daily monitoring of cell growth, viability, product concentration, and metabolite profiles (glucose, glutamine, lactate, and ammonium) was conducted. All subclones exhibited acceptable growth and viability, but their performance varied in terms of productivity and product quality. A follow-up round of fed-batch testing with the three best-performing clones confirmed the similarity of their growth traits while revealing differences in productivity and glycoprotein quality attributes.</p><p>Based on an integrated evaluation of culture stability, productivity, and product quality, clone 4E22 was selected as the leading candidate.

Clone 4E22 was also used to test fed-batch reproducibility at a different scale and to examine the effects of a glucose-enriched feed solution. Based on glucose consumption data, the feed for F987 was enriched to 120 g/L glucose to keep levels around 3 g/L throughout the process. Other runs followed the standard feeding protocol. The new pH control method, utilizing CO<sub>2</sub> regulation at the upper deadband and limiting base addition until a pH threshold of 6.65 was reached, was applied to all bioreactors, which were now operated with light protection. <xref rid="vaccines-13-00980-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> summarizes the experimental conditions and results.

Notably, F994 showed improved productivity, with projected titers reaching up to 250 mg/L by day 14. This suggests that a slight extension of the cultivation period could increase volumetric productivity. Although F991 showed slightly higher titers during the feeding phase, likely due to better growth kinetics, these differences remained within typical process variation.</p><p>Process Metabolites: The pH and lactate profiles were consistent across all runs, maintaining stability without the need for base addition (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00980-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b). Glucose levels remained within control limits throughout, supported by the glucose-enriched feed (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00980-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>d). No bolus glucose additions were required. However, in extended runs such as F994, nutrient modeling indicated that supplemental glucose or a reformulated feed may be necessary during the final 48 h to maintain carbon availability. Glutamine and ammonium concentrations followed expected trends across all runs, with minor deviations observed in F994. These were attributed to the detection limits of the metabolite analyzer rather than true biological variation. Ammonium accumulation remained within non-inhibitory ranges, and no adverse effects on growth or productivity were observed.</p><p>Implications for cGMP Process Scaling: The reproducibility of cell growth, viability, and productivity across replicate runs, along with stable metabolite profiles, confirms the robustness of the upstream process for the CHO/HxB2C clone. Additionally, the extended culture in F994 demonstrates the feasibility of process intensification, providing an opportunity for yield improvement during scale-up. These findings support the selection of this upstream platform for cGMP manufacturing and supply representative material for downstream process characterization and validation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-vaccines-13-00980"><title>3.5.

The process includes upstream cell culture operations, downstream purification steps, and final formulation of the drug substance. It begins with thawing a vial from the CHO/HxB2C MCB. Cells are expanded in chemically defined, serum-free media under strictly controlled conditions. The seed train involves sequential sub-cultivation steps to reach high cell densities. Once the culture attains approximately 1.4 &#215; 10<sup>10</sup> viable cells, it is used to inoculate a 500 L bioreactor (Stainless Steel) operated under cGMP conditions. The bioreactor follows a structured inoculum, batch, and fed-batch strategy. Key process parameters&#8212;temperature (set to 37 &#176;C), pH (set to 7.0), and dissolved oxygen (pO<sub>2</sub> set to 40%)&#8212;are continuously monitored and digitally controlled.

Purification and Process Yield</title><p>The downstream purification of the batch T206 harvest involved a multi-step process aimed at gradually removing impurities and enriching the target protein to achieve drug substance quality. Initially, the clarified harvest underwent ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UDF1) and detergent viral inactivation (DVI), with ELISA monitoring to verify target preservation. This was followed by anion-exchange chromatography (AEX1), then hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HAC), and mixed-mode chromatography (CC400) to reduce host-cell proteins and process-related impurities. A polishing cation-exchange step (CEX) was implemented to enhance purity before a second anion-exchange step (membrane adsorber) (AEX2). Subsequent ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UDF2) and nanofiltration (NF) facilitated concentration, buffer exchange, and viral clearance. The process concluded with the final drug substance production, monitored throughout by UV absorbance (A280 nm) for protein recovery.</p><p>Yield analysis across steps (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00980-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) revealed variable purification efficiencies, with the most significant product loss occurring at HAC (63.0% yield) and AEX2 (79.9% yield), both of which are critical for high-stringency impurity removal. Conversely, intermediate steps such as AEX1 (81.6%), CEX (96.2%), UDF2 (97.5%), and NF (98.9%) demonstrated high recoveries, reflecting effective control with minimal nonspecific loss. The overall drug substance yield was 18.5%, aligning closely with the historical average of 20.4%. Although overall process efficiency remains comparable, the data suggest HAC and AEX2 as potential yield bottlenecks. These insights emphasize the importance of balancing impurity removal with product recovery, thus highlighting opportunities to optimize these steps and boost overall yield without compromising quality.</p><p>Individual step yields are shown as percentage yields relative to the product fraction from the previous step. The expected step yield refers to the minimum and maximum yields obtained during the development and optimization phases to provide context for individual cGMP step yields. Yields highlighted in green indicate steps where the yields exceeded the expected yields during development. The overall yield reflects the cumulative process yield after each corresponding step. Since overall yields are influenced by sampling for the virus clearance and validation studies, corrected overall yields (expressed as percentages or absolute product amounts in mg) are also provided as &#8220;theoretical w/o ViVc&#8221; values.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-vaccines-13-00980"><title>3.6. Viral Clearance Evaluation</title><p>A viral clearance study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the downstream purification process in inactivating and removing potential viral contaminants from the recombinant HxB2.WT.Core-C4b immunogen. The study was performed by ViruSure GmbH (Austria) under contract, following international regulatory guidance, including ICH Q5A (R2) and EMA guidelines on viral safety evaluation of biotechnological investigational medicinal products. A virus spiking method was used to measure viral reduction at specific downstream processing (DSP) steps. Model viruses, such as the enveloped retrovirus XMuLV and the non-enveloped parvovirus MMV, were intentionally added to the process intermediate material. Viral clearance was then assessed across four distinct unit operations within the production process.</p><p>The following DSP steps were evaluated:</p><p>Detergent Virodex TXR-1treatment (effective): This step effectively inactivated enveloped viruses through disruption of the viral envelope.</p><p>Anion exchange chromatography (partially effective): For anion exchange chromatography, Sartobind STIC PA membrane adsorber capsule (Sartorius, G&#246;ttingen, Germany) was used. The HxB2.WT.Core-C4b protein was recovered in the eluate fraction. Viral reduction was mediated by physicochemical partitioning; no chemical inactivation was expected based on buffer conditions.</p><p>Hydroxyapatite chromatography (non-effective): Similar to AEX, virus removal was driven by partitioning, with limited contribution to inactivation.</p><p>Nanofiltration (effective): A Planova 20N virus filter was used to retain viruses by size exclusion, providing a robust virus removal mechanism.</p><p>The combined viral clearance data demonstrated strong process performance (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00980-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). For the enveloped model virus X-MuLV, the overall logarithmic reduction factor (LRF) was estimated at approximately 13.66, indicating a high safety margin. For the more resistant non-enveloped MMV, the overall LRF was around 7.65, which aligns with the expected lower susceptibility of non-enveloped viruses to inactivation. Notably, detergent treatment was not tested on MMV due to its resistance to such methods.</p><p>An estimate of residual viral particles per clinical dose was calculated based on data from virus-like particles in the unprocessed harvest. For a single 300 &#181;g dose of immunogen, the viral load was less than 1.3 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;5</sup> particles, or fewer than 4.6 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;3</sup> particles per mg of protein. These figures indicate a viral safety factor greater than 10<sup>5</sup>, corresponding to over 75,000 doses with no detectable particles.</p><p>Collectively, the viral clearance study confirms that the downstream process offers strong and multifaceted viral reduction capabilities. The combination of chemical inactivation and physical removal steps effectively reduces the risk of viral contamination, ensuring product safety for clinical evaluation at this stage of development.

Discussion</title><sec id="sec4dot1-vaccines-13-00980"><title>4.1. Development Runs with the First Cell Line</title><p>The cell culture process time needed to reach the harvest criteria was 1 to 2 days shorter than expected, likely because of decreased cellular stress from reducing gas flow through a lower dissolved oxygen (DO) setpoint and maintaining overall low shear forces. Lowering the pH setpoint during the process significantly increased the final product concentration by reducing or eliminating the need for base addition. In contrast, a temperature shift to lower levels did not improve process performance, as cell-specific productivity was negatively affected. However, even at 33 &#176;C, an acceptable yield was maintained. Additional observations showed that adding antifoam was unnecessary, and light protection should be used to maintain process stability. Filtration studies demonstrated that other depth filter materials were suitable, and the introduction of an AEX step after depth filtration was achieved by adding a MAQ absorber (Emphaze, 3 M) step, which effectively reduced impurities at harvest.</p><p>Lowering the pH setpoint decreased lactate buildup and reduced the need for base addition, stabilizing osmolality and lowering metabolic stress on the cells. This supports previous findings that mild acidification can shift CHO metabolism from lactate production to more efficient nutrient use, thus enabling higher productivity. Importantly, no changes were observed in nanoparticle assembly or <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-glycosylation profiles, confirming that product quality attributes stayed stable under these altered conditions. The temperature shift slowed metabolic rates and cell growth, which likely contributed to lower specific productivity despite potential benefits for protein folding and stability seen in other CHO processes.
