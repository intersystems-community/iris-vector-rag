Chronic inflammation is recognized as the main pathological mechanism leading to retinal damage during the onset and progression of DR. Alpha kinase 1 (<italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic>), a member of a recently discovered serine/threonine protein kinase family, is associated with the onset of multiple inflammatory conditions. Dominant mutations in the <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> gene can result in a rare genetic disorder, known as ROSAH syndrome, which is characterized by ocular inflammatory responses. The role of <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> in DR remains largely unclear and necessitates additional research for a better understanding. Therefore, investigating the function and underlying mechanisms of <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> in DR is highly necessary. In this research, ALPK1 expression and inflammatory cytokines levels were examined in <italic toggle="yes">db/db</italic> diabetic mice. Additionally, BV2 mouse microglial cells were utilized to establish a hypoxia model that mimicked DR conditions, and the influence of <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> knockdown on these conditions was assessed. The effects of <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> knockdown on retinal damage in <italic toggle="yes">db/db</italic> diabetic mice were also evaluated. In <italic toggle="yes">db/db</italic> mice, our findings indicated a decrease in retinal cell numbers and irregular retinal blood vessel formation, along with increased levels of ALPK1 and inflammatory markers TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, IL-6, and IL-18. ALPK1 expression was found to be associated with the TIFA/TRAF6 signaling pathway. Knockdown of <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> was shown to reduce the levels of these inflammatory cytokines, diminish GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis signaling, and mitigate the DR-induced retinal cell damage in BV2 cells. Furthermore, reducing ALPK1 expression in the retinas of <italic toggle="yes">db/db</italic> diabetic mice was observed to slow down retinal cell degeneration and alleviate microvascular injury within the retina. This research indicated the substantial involvement of <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> in the diabetic retinopathy-linked inflammatory cascade and cell pyroptosis. Targeting the <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> signaling pathway could open avenues for novel therapeutic strategies to manage DR.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-17122-x.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ALPK1</kwd><kwd>diabetic retinopathy</kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Db/db</italic> diabetic mice</kwd><kwd>Pyroptosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cytokines</kwd><kwd>Immune cell death</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Aier Eye-Sichuan University Research Fundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>23JZH046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Nai-Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par29">Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a crucial contributor to vision impairment in individuals with diabetes due to its impact on the microvasculature. DR poses a significant burden on individuals, their families, and society at large<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. DR is frequently divided into the following two categories: nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). NPDR is marked by heightened vascular permeability, blockage of capillaries, retinal bleeding, the presence of hard exudates, the basement membrane thickening, and a reduction in pericytes surrounding the retinal blood vessels. In contrast, PDR can result in the growth of pathological new blood vessels, vitreous hemorrhaging, retinal scarring, and even retinal detachment. Patients with both NPDR and PDR may develop diabetic macular edema (DME) as a consequence of the breakdown of the blood-retina barrier (BRB), leading to the accumulation of fluid in the macula. In severe cases, this can result in blindness for those with DR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Current treatment approaches for DR include surgical and medical interventions. Surgical methods, such as retinal laser photocoagulation and vitrectomy, carry certain risks and potential side effects. Medical treatments primarily consist of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies. However, the treatment comes with various limitations, such as the requirement for multiple intraocular injections, reduced therapeutic effectiveness, and comparatively low rates of efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, exploring the development of DR and identifying novel treatment targets are essential.</p><p id="Par30">Immune dysregulation and inflammation significantly contribute to the pathology of DR. As DR progresses, an immunological imbalance within the retina activates involve Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NLRP3, and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) signaling pathways. Cui and his team found that the ALPK1/NF-&#954;B pathway has the ability to activate the classical NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway. This activation induces pyroptosis and results in the significant inflammatory cytokines release12. This activation leads to an elevated release of inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to inflammatory damage in the retina and further facilitate the initiation and advancement of DR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup><italic toggle="yes">. ALPK1,</italic> a member of the alpha-kinase family lacking sequence similarity with conventional protein kinases<italic toggle="yes">.</italic> It also differs from traditional kinases in the recognition and phosphorylation of specific amino acid sites. ALPK1 is expressed in organs such as the brain, retina, and heart and plays a crucial role in regulating inflammatory pathways involved in cardiac and renal diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. ALPK1 consists of 1,244 amino acids and is made up of 16 exons. It contains several amphipathic helices in its N-terminal segment and possesses an alpha-kinase catalytic domain located in its C-terminal segment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In 2018, Zhou et al. discovered that <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> could function as a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor (PRR) capable of recognizing the bacterial metabolite adenosine diphosphate-heptose (ADP-Hep). This recognition process triggers the phosphorylation of TIFA, activates the downstream TRAF6/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway, and sets off the innate immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">Studies have shown a correlation between the ALPK1 protein expression and diabetes. In pancreatic beta cells, cytokines increase ALPK1 expression, which can induce cell apoptosis through the <italic toggle="yes">TNF-&#945;</italic> pathway. Furthermore, increased levels of the ALPK1 protein are detected in the kidneys of diabetic individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Mutations that enhance the function of the <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> gene can lead to a rare genetic condition called ROSAH syndrome. This disorder is characterized by clinical manifestations including retinal dysplasia, swelling of the optic nerve, enlargement of the spleen, lack of sweating (anhidrosis), and migraines. Notably, ocular fundus changes and splenomegaly with hypersplenism are particularly prominent in pediatric patients. Mutations in <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic>, such as p.Thr237Met and p.Tyr254Cys, have been identified, with the latter being associated with inflammatory characteristics, including intraocular inflammation.

The main pathogenesis of DR Includes retinal hypoxia and hyperglycemia. This study simulated DR conditions in microglia under hypoxic conditions or high glucose conditions. BV2 cells were exposed to various concentrations of glucose for 24&#160;h (25, 50, 100, and 150&#160;mM) to explore the influence of hyperglycemia on ALPK1 expression. The findings indicated that in a high glucose environment, microglial viability diminished, their morphology altered, and the cell bodies enlarged without amoeboid morphology, suggesting activation of BV2 cells was not evident. Moreover, the levels of ALPK1 expression in BV2 cells did not show a significant increase in response to high glucose conditions (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>A&#8211;D). BV2 cells were exposed to 1% O<sub>2</sub> for various durations (0, 6, 12, and 24&#160;h) to explore the influence of hypoxia on ALPK1 expression. After 24&#160;h of hypoxia exposure, microglia displayed full activation, which was characterized by enlarged cell bodies and an amoeboid morphology (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). The CCK-8 assay indicated that exposure of BV2 cells to hypoxia for 6&#160;h had no significant impact on cell viability or morphology. However, exposure to hypoxia for 12 or 24&#160;h led to decreased cell viability and induced activation, with the most pronounced effects evident after 24&#160;h (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), suggesting the progressive activation of microglia. Notably, these findings suggested that hypoxia treatment, particularly after 24-h incubation, could trigger microglial activation. To further explore this phenomenon, western blot analysis was employed to assess the expression of ALPK1 protein in BV2 cells subjected to hypoxia for a duration of 24&#160;h. This study aimed to explore whether elevated ALPK1 levels could signify a role for microglia in fueling DR-associated inflammation.

Under the fluorescence microscope, nearly 70% green fluorescence was observed in the sgNC or sgALPK1 group. In contrast to the sgNC group, the ALPK1 protein level in BV2 cells from the sgALPK1 group was markedly reduced. The BV2 cells were divided into three distinct groups as follows: normal cells, sgNC cells, and sgALPK1 cells, representing the experimental conditions for the study (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>A&#8211;C).

Fundus photography was conducted on sgNC and sgALPK1 injected mice 7 to 8&#160;weeks postinjection and revealed that compared with sgNC, sgALPK1 led to a notable reduction in retinal exudation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>C). To further evaluate retinal improvements, HE staining and a retinal trypsin digestion assay were performed on sgNC and sgALPK1-treated mice.

Induction of metabolic disorders by chronic hyperglycemia in the retinas of diabetic individuals prompts the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) release, culminating in an augmented inflammatory reaction that worsens DR through an innate immune system imbalance. These DAMPs activate pattern recognition receptors, which then mediate the inflammatory cytokines secretion, activate inflammasomes, and initiate immune responses, among other effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The NLRP3 inflammasome is instrumental in the advancement of eye diseases, including DR. NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggers cell pyroptosis, resulting in the release of significant amounts of IL-18 and IL-1&#946;. In turn, these cytokines can activate retinal microglia, contribute to neuronal loss, and lead to microvascular damage, all of which accelerate the progression of DR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> functions as a PRR situated in the cytoplasm and is linked to a variety of inflammatory conditions, including diabetes, gout, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and ROSAH syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In this investigation, the role of <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> in DR was investigated through studies conducted on <italic toggle="yes">db/db</italic> diabetic mice and a BV2 cell model of DR. qPCR and immunofluorescence staining revealed an increase in ALPK1 expression in the retinas of <italic toggle="yes">db/db</italic> mice aged between 20 and 24&#160;weeks. Furthermore, FFA analysis revealed characteristics such as retinal pigment epithelial cell shedding and exudation. HE staining of retinal sections revealed decreases in the retinal cell count and thickness in these mice. Furthermore, the examination of retinal vascular flat mounts and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining indicated damage to the retinal microvasculature, characterized by increases in acellular capillary. All in all, the findings indicated that ALPK1 may play a significant role in the retinal lesions observed in <italic toggle="yes">db/db</italic> diabetic mice.</p><p id="Par62"><italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> may mediate an increase in TRAF6 expression by inducing the phosphorylation of TIFA at the T9 position, which subsequently triggers the NF-&#954;B signaling pathway. The activation prompts the release of inflammatory cytokines and sets off the innate immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the classical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway is triggered by the ALPK1/NF-&#954;B signaling cascade, subsequently triggering the downstream caspase-1/GSDMD pathway and ultimately resulting in pyroptosis. This sequential process leads to a significant secretion IL-1&#946; and IL-18<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The progression of DR is linked to the pyroptosis of essential ocular cell types, including RMECs, microglia, and RPE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In the retinas of <italic toggle="yes">db/db</italic> mice, an increased expression IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-&#945;, was observed through qPCR and ELISA assays. Within the retinal tissue of these mice, western blot analysis revealed notable elevations in the levels of phosphorylated TIFA and TRAF6 proteins. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated a marked enhancement in the nuclear translocation of NF-&#954;B p65 within retinal cells, indicating the dissociation of NF-&#954;B p65 from the NF-&#954;B/I&#954;B complex, its activation, exposure of the nuclear localization signal, formation of a p65/p50 dimer, and this facilitates its swift movement into the nucleus, where it activates the transcription and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated notable elevations regarding the expressions of NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD found in the retinas of <italic toggle="yes">db/db</italic> mice. The results show a likely involvement of ALPK1 in the onset and advancement of DR. This proposed role could be associated with the activation of the NF-&#954;B pathway through the ALPK1/TIFA/TRAF6 signaling cascade, which subsequently triggers the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway. This activation results in the release of significant amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exacerbates damage to the retinal microvasculature, and exacerbates the loss of retinal cells.</p><p id="Par63">Within the retina, microglia function as crucial immune surveillance cells capable of actively monitoring neuronal activity and facilitating angiogenesis during retinal maturation. Functioning as vigilant sensors of the retinal microenvironment, these cells are predominantly located in the INL, including RNFL, GCL, and both the inner and outer plexiform layers. Rapidly responsive to diverse stimuli, microglia are crucial in regulating immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In the context of DR, retinal microglia become activated under conditions such as hyperglycemia, ischemia, and hypoxia. Following activation, microglia proliferate and exhibit morphological alterations, transitioning from an elongated morphology with slender branches to an amoeboid shape featuring an enlarged cell body and shortened, thicker branches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Overactive microglia can enhance the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thereby inducing persistent inflammation in the retina. This inflammation exacerbates retinal damage, and the loss of retinal cells, and causes microvascular injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The activation level of microglia in the retinas of <italic toggle="yes">db/db</italic> mice was assessed using an Iba-1 antibody. The immunostaining results demonstrated significant activation of retinal microglia in <italic toggle="yes">db/db</italic> mice, which was associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in the retina and the expression pattern of ALPK1. It is postulated that <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic>, acting as a receptor for pattern recognition, potentially contributes to the inflammatory retinal damage observed in DR.</p><p id="Par64">In the sgRNA-ALPK1/hypoxia group, the levels of TIFA phosphorylation and TRAF6 protein were lower in the ALPK1-knockdown BV2 cells compared to those in the sgRNA-NC/hypoxia group. Concomitant with these decreases, a decline in the nuclear translocation of NF-&#954;B p65 was noted, accompanied by a decrease in the activation of downstream targets such as NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD. In addition, reductions in the concentrations of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IL-1&#946;, and IL-18 were observed in the supernatant of the cell culture. These results indicate that ALPK1, acting as a PRR, is likely to play a part in the inflammatory response initiated by the activation of retinal microglia in DR.</p><p id="Par65">When<italic toggle="yes"> ALPK1</italic> was knocked down in BV2 cells, the pyroptosis pathway, which is typically induced by hypoxia, was effectively inhibited. The downregulation of ALPK1 expression led to a decrease in the release of inflammatory cytokines from BV2 cells, leading to increased survival rates of RGC-5 cells and MRECs. Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> knockdown led to a decrease in LDH release. These findings indicate that the inhibition of <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> could decrease inflammation, potentially mitigating the degeneration of RGCs and the injury to RMECs. Targeted inhibition of <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> in the retina can effectively reduce retinal damage associated with DR. The prevalence of acellular capillaries within the retina decreased, indicating a positive impact of <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> knockdown on microvascular damage.</p><p id="Par66">In summary, ALPK1 expression elevate in both in mice and in cell models of DR. Local knockdown of <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> was shown to ameliorate retinal damage and provide a protective effect against DR in <italic toggle="yes">db/db</italic> mice. This protective effect is probably facilitated by the reduction of inflammatory cytokine levels. In particular, the suppression of ALPK1 interfered with the ALPK1-mediated TIFA/TRAF6/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway, resulting in the subsequent disruption of the downstream NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway. This process contributes to inflammation reduction and the enhancement of retinal well-being.</p><p id="Par67">The findings of this study establish a foundation for the use of <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> as a prospective therapeutic target in DR. Nonetheless, the study has certain limitations. Retinal tissue encompasses diverse cell populations, such as microglia, RMECs, RPEs and RGCs. The current knowledge gaps do not allow complete clarification of <italic toggle="yes">ALPK1</italic> impacts on the initiation and progression of DR via its involvement in the physiological mechanisms of these various cell types. This ambiguity highlights a path for our forthcoming research pursuits. Inhibition of pyroptosis and blockade of inflammasome-mediated cell death pathways may represent novel therapeutic strategies for DR in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec280" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
