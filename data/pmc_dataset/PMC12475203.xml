Effective deployment of CCS projects requires the optimal matching of CO<sub>2</sub> emission sources with storage sinks, as well as efficient routing through onshore and offshore transportation networks. This research focuses specifically on truck-based transportation, a practical and flexible delivery mode given the current infrastructure conditions in Thailand. The optimization problem is formulated as a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), aiming to minimize total travel distance while meeting CO<sub>2</sub> transportation capacity constraints. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, traditional optimization techniques often encounter limitations. To address this, a constrained K-means clustering algorithm is first applied to perform source&#8211;sink matching, grouping CO<sub>2</sub> emission sources based on proximity and capacity compatibility with designated storage sinks, i.e., the Lampang, Nong Bua, Suphanburi, and Kra basins. The clustering process incorporates two key constraints to ensure feasibility and efficiency. Subsequently, the Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (AHA), inspired by the foraging behavior of hummingbirds, is applied for route optimization. AHA is particularly effective for complex optimization problems due to its strong global search capabilities. The model is applied to a case study in Thailand, taking into account the country&#8217;s unique geographical and infrastructural features. The objective function aims to minimize travel distance, thereby improving both the cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability of CCS deployment. Results demonstrate that AHA significantly outperforms Dijkstra&#8217;s and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms, achieving approximately a 13% reduction in travel distance and a 15% decrease in the number of vehicles required within the Suphanburi Cluster. These findings provide valuable insights for enhancing CCS implementation in Thailand and other regions with similar characteristics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Engineering</kwd><kwd>Environmental sciences</kwd><kwd>Mathematics and computing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>CMU Junior Research Fellowship Program</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>NSRF via the Program Management Unit for Human Resources &amp; Institutional Development, Research and Innovation</institution></funding-source><award-id>B42G670031</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Chiang Mai University</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) was held in Glasgow, Scotland, from October 31 to November 13, 2021. The conference brought together representatives from nearly 200 countries, including Thailand, to discuss and negotiate global actions on climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). During COP26, Thailand made significant contributions and commitments to its climate action efforts, with one of the key commitments being the achievement of carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2065<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Due to the significant contribution of industrial processes and power generation to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, CCS technology was developed to capture and store CO<sub>2</sub> before its release into the atmosphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Once captured, CO<sub>2</sub> is transported to a designated storage site, where it is either securely stored underground or utilized for other industrial purposes. CO<sub>2</sub> is captured in emission sources, such as power plants and industrial facilities, using technologies that separate CO<sub>2</sub> from other gases produced during combustion or industrial processes. There are three primary methods of CO<sub>2</sub> capture: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, and oxy-fuel combustion. The key differences between these methods are as follows: the post-combustion method captures CO<sub>2</sub> after fuel combustion, while the pre-combustion method converts fuel into a gas mixture and separates CO<sub>2</sub> before combustion. The oxy-fuel combustion method burns fuel in oxygen instead of air, resulting in a more concentrated CO<sub>2</sub> stream<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Additionally, CO<sub>2</sub> is injected into deep geological formations for long-term storage or as a sink. Common sinks include depleted oil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and gas reservoirs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, deep saline aquifers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and basalt formations, which chemically react with CO<sub>2</sub> to form solid carbonates over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Therefore, the CO<sub>2</sub> transportation is a crucial process that links CCS sources to sinks and informs the design of the most suitable transportation method. After CO<sub>2</sub> is captured from its source, it must be transported to a sink or utilization site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This can be achieved using various methods, including trucks, rails, ships, pipelines, or a combination of these. While pipelines are considered the most efficient and cost-effective option for transporting large quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> over long distances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, pipelines require significant initial infrastructure investments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and are vulnerable to maintenance issues or natural disasters, which could cause costly disruptions. Ships are another viable option, particularly for transporting CO<sub>2</sub> across oceans or between countries, but are less efficient for short distances and depend on the availability of shipping infrastructure and weather conditions, which can cause delays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Rail transport presents an alternative option. However, similar to maritime shipping, it is constrained by the availability of existing rail infrastructure and offers less operational flexibility compared to trucking. Conversely, trucks provide a more versatile solution, especially for transporting smaller volumes or over shorter distances. Trucks can access areas that other transport modes cannot, making them ideal for connecting smaller industrial facilities to nearby storage or utilization sites. Trucks also offer more flexibility in terms of routing and speed, which is particularly advantageous during pilot CCS projects or in areas where pipelines and ships are not feasible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, one disadvantage of truck transport is that it may not be as cost-effective as pipelines for transporting larger quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> over longer distances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The CCS transport routing is a critical and complex component of CO<sub>2</sub> transportation, involving the identification of optimal paths from emission sources to storage or utilization sites. In CCS networks, this task is complicated by the geographic dispersion of sources and sinks, diverse transportation modes, and the need to minimize both costs and environmental impact. Pipeline routing must account for terrain, population density, regulatory constraints, and safety requirements, with a focus on reducing Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) while ensuring system reliability. Consequently, dynamic and adaptive routing strategies are essential to address these multifaceted operational challenges. From an optimization perspective, the CCS routing problem shares strong parallels with the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, which involves determining cost-effective routes for capacity-constrained vehicles to meet multiple demand locations. Similarly, in CCS logistics, vehicles (or transport segments) must efficiently collect or transport fixed quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> while respecting capacity constraints and minimizing overall costs. Due to the NP-hard nature of the CVRP and its variants, exact solution methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale CCS networks. Consequently, researchers often employ metaheuristic optimization algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, which provide near-optimal solutions within reasonable computational times. These methods have been successfully applied to CCS routing challenges, enabling the exploration of large solution spaces while accommodating complex constraints.</p><p id="Par6">Although interest in CCS is increasing, research on the optimization of CO<sub>2</sub> transportation networks remains limited, particularly in developing countries such as Thailand. These regions face different challenges related to infrastructure constraints and geographic variability. Existing studies predominantly focus on pipeline-based systems in developed countries, often overlooking the need for flexible, multi-modal transport solutions suitable for emerging CCS frameworks. Furthermore, the use of advanced optimization techniques, including bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, has not been thoroughly investigated. To address these gaps, this research proposes an optimal routing strategy for CO<sub>2</sub> transportation within each cluster in Thailand using the Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (AHA), a bio-inspired metaheuristic approach tailored to the national infrastructure and policy context. According to the geographic and infrastructure considerations, as well as the Thailand CCS Technology Roadmap (CCS TRM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, Thailand plans to invest in truck and pipeline transportation systems. Clusters for CCS source-sink matching in Thailand were generated using the constrained K-means algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, which is an enhanced variant of the traditional K-means algorithm. The proposed clusters are defined based on six main key sectors contributing to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: cement, chemicals, food and beverages, iron-steel, power, and others. Potential storage sinks are located across various regions in Thailand, including the Lampang Basin in Lampang Province, the Nong Bua Basin in Phichit Province, the Suphanburi Basin in Suphanburi Province, and the Kra Basin in the Gulf of Thailand. These sites have been identified as priority areas for pilot-scale carbon storage projects under the CCS TRM, aligning with Thailand&#8217;s strategic plan to achieve carbon neutrality and net-zero emission. This CO<sub>2</sub> transportation clustering and routing framework is intended to guide the development of the CCS industry and facilitate efficient CO<sub>2</sub> conveyance within Thailand. These efforts support the country&#8217;s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, as outlined in the CCS TRM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Related works and contribution</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Related works</title><p id="Par7">This section reviews and summaries key studies that contribute to the advancement of CCS systems, with a particular focus on the optimization of carbon transportation networks. The literature covers CCS planning and deployment at both global and regional levels, with particular emphasis on source&#8211;sink matching, network design, and routing optimization.</p><p id="Par8">In the context of China, Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> proposed a three-module framework for CCS deployment, encompassing source&#8211;sink matching, network meshing, and pipeline transportation allocation. Their comprehensive database includes major CO<sub>2</sub> emission sources from the thermal power, cement, and iron&#8211;steel sectors, as well as potential CO<sub>2</sub> storage sites. The study compared scenarios with and without offshore storage and concluded that offshore storage is particularly advantageous in southern coastal provinces. Additionally, the authors estimated planned deployment capacities, calculated unit net supply chain costs, and assessed the evolution of CCS deployment needed to achieve carbon neutrality between 2025 and 2050. Similarly, Becattini et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> developed an optimization framework for the design of CCS supply chains, focusing on the installation, sizing, and operation of CO<sub>2</sub> capture and transportation technologies. The problem was formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to minimize total supply chain costs while meeting emission reduction targets over a 25-year horizon. Applied to Switzerland&#8217;s waste-to-energy sector, the study considered various decarbonization pathways and storage site options. Results showed that transportation costs were the dominant factor, with pipelines being the most cost-effective mode, especially for large CO<sub>2</sub> volumes. In the European context, Sun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> introduced a hubs-and-clusters approach for source-to-sink assessment to identify optimal CCS deployment zones and foster political and public support. Applied to Spain, the methodology identified 15 emission hubs and recommended four priority regions for CCS development. The study highlighted the role of CCS in achieving mid-century net-zero targets, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors and hydrocarbon-limited countries. In developed countries, Balaji and Rabiei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> focused on optimizing pipeline routing in the North-Central United States. The authors used graph network theory to identify optimal paths connecting various carbon sources and sinks. In South Korea, Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> developed a CCS pipeline optimization model under practical design constraints using Mixed-Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP).</p><p id="Par9">Focusing on Thailand, Promsuk et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> proposed improving CO<sub>2</sub> transportation efficiency through source-sink clustering. The study utilized unsupervised machine learning techniques, including Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and constrained K-means algorithms, to match emissions from key sectors (cement, chemical, power, and iron&#8211;steel) with geological storage potential in basins such as Lampang, Nong Bua, and Kra. Optimization techniques were then applied to design multimodal transportation networks (e.g., trucks and hybrid methods), tailored to local infrastructure and environmental conditions. Further, Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> conducted a comprehensive analysis of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from both power generation (coal, natural gas, and waste-to-energy) and industrial sectors (cement, refineries, iron and steel, petrochemicals, and gas processing), estimating total emissions of 143 Mtpa, which is 79 Mtpa from power and 64 Mtpa from industry. Natural gas-fired power plants and cement factories were identified as the largest emitters. The study also evaluated Thailand&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> storage potential, identifying offshore and onshore sedimentary basins with an estimated total capacity of 79 Gt. In addition, Choomkong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> assessed CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from biomass and fossil fuel power plants, reporting 1.134 Mt from biomass and 105 Mt from fossil fuels. Based on data from Thailand&#8217;s Department of Mineral Fuels, the study estimated that onshore storage could accommodate 165.12 Mt, while offshore capacity could reach 2,120 Mt. The research also included a preliminary source&#8211;sink matching analysis to evaluate CCS feasibility in the region. For non-pipeline transport methods, Chaisurajinda et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> optimized truck transportation routes for 23 CO<sub>2</sub> emission point sources in northeastern Thailand. Using various open-source tools, the authors provided detailed route specifications, including origin-destination pairs, working hours, pickup volumes, distances, and trip costs. Their analysis revealed that an optimal configuration using seven vehicles could efficiently collect approximately 20 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per day, amounting to about 5,565 tonnes annually.</p><p id="Par10">The majority of existing research focuses on source&#8211;sink matching, relatively less attention has been paid to transportation logistics, particularly the optimization of CO<sub>2</sub> routing, which is presented in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Contribution</title><p id="Par11">To the best of our knowledge, this research presents the novel approach to optimizing CO<sub>2</sub> transportation routes for CCS in Thailand. The proposed method combines a constrained K-means algorithm to cluster CO<sub>2</sub> sources and sinks, followed by the implementation of the AHA to optimize routing within each cluster. The key contribution lies in the integration of clustering with a bio-inspired metaheuristic, which significantly enhances the practicality and efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub> transportation network design. The selection of AHA over other popular metaheuristic algorithms such as PSO, GA, and ACO is motivated by AHA&#8217;s ability to balance between exploration and exploitation, fast convergence, and strong adaptability to complex, high-dimensional, and constrained optimization problems. These features make AHA particularly suitable for addressing the routing challenges in CCS logistics. In addition, this research utilizes real-world data from Thailand, including emission source and sink locations. The six major CO<sub>2</sub> source sectors include cement, chemicals, food and beverages, iron and steel, power, and other industrial facilities. The designated CO<sub>2</sub> sink sites comprise four geological storage basins: the Lampang Basin, Nong Bua Basin, Suphanburi Basin, and Kra Basin.

In this research, two specific constraints are imposed: (i) each cluster must contain at least one sink, and (ii) the total emission rate of the sources within a cluster must not exceed the injection rate of the sink in that same cluster. These constraints reflect the underlying physical or operational relationships inherent in the data. The clustering procedure begins by computing the haversine distance between data points and storage sinks to accurately capture their geographical proximity on the Earth&#8217;s surface. Initial clusters are formed using the standard K-means algorithm based on these distances. Subsequently, the clusters are iteratively refined by considering both spatial proximity and the mentioned constraints. If a cluster violates any of the constraints, corrective actions are taken by reassigning the nearest data point that causes the violation to the next closest cluster that satisfies the constraints. This iterative update continues until all clusters comply with the constraints, ensuring that the resulting clusters are both spatially coherent and consistent with the system&#8217;s operational requirements. The sources and sinks for each cluster are illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, while the emission and injection rates for each cluster are presented in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. As previously mentioned, many sources are located in the eastern and central region of Thailand. The Suphanburi Cluster exhibits a high utilization rate of approximately 95%, while the Nong Bua Cluster follows with around 24%, representing the two highest rates among all clusters. These elevated utilization rates can be partially explained by the relatively small storage capacities of these basins and the location of emission sources. In contrast, the Lampang Cluster in the northern region has a utilization rate of less than 2%. This low figure is primarily due to the limited number of emission sources in the north compared to the more resource-abundant central and eastern regions.<fig id="Fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>CCS source-sink matching in Thailand, grouped into four clusters using the constrained K-means algorithm.

This research examines three algorithms: Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm, PSO algorithm, and AHA. Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm provides a classical deterministic approach to calculate the shortest path in a static network with known distances. PSO algorithm, a population-based metaheuristic inspired by bird flocking behavior, offers greater flexibility in exploring complex, high-dimensional search spaces. To further enhance solution diversity and convergence efficiency, this research propose AHA, a novel algorithm modeled after the intelligent foraging behavior of hummingbirds. In addition to overall route optimization, these methods are also evaluated for their ability to find the optimal route within the cluster, ensuring localized efficiency in segmented network environments. Comparative analysis of these methods highlights trade-offs in accuracy, adaptability, and computational performance for optimal route selection.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm</title><p id="Par17">Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> is a graph search method used to determine the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It is widely applied in routing, navigation systems, and network flow analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In this research, the graph represents CO<sub>2</sub> emission sources as nodes, with sinks designated as destination nodes. The edges of the graph correspond to the road network within the country, with weights assigned based on the distances between each node. The algorithm constructs a tree of the shortest paths from the emission sources to the destination sink. It works by maintaining a set of unvisited emission sources and calculating tentative distances from a source node to each destination sink. When a shorter path to a specific node is found, the algorithm updates the corresponding distance. This algorithm is the method utilized in the Network Analysis tool in ArcGIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</title><p id="Par18">PSO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> is a population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of group organisms, such as bee swarms, fish schools, and bird flocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. PSO mimics the physical movements of particles within a swarm as a search method, incorporating both cognitive and social behaviors to enable local and global exploration. In PSO, a solution to a specific problem is represented by the position of an n-dimensional particle. The particle searches for a solution by moving through the search space with a velocity vector.</p><p id="Par19">The PSO algorithm begins with a swarm of particles, each with a random initial position and velocity. During each iteration, every particle moves from its previous position to a new position based on its velocity. The velocity is updated according to the particle&#8217;s personal best position and the global best position discovered so far. When a particle reaches a position with a better objective function (fitness function) than its previous best, the personal best position is updated. Additionally, if the particle finds a better objective function than the global best obtained by the entire swarm, the global best position is updated. PSO can be applied to find optimal routes or solve the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Ai and Kachitvichyanukul<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> proposed a PSO-based method for solving the CVRP, where the objective is to determine the most efficient set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers, considering the capacity constraints of each vehicle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The decoding method begins by transforming the particle into a priority list of customers for each route and a priority matrix for the vehicle serving each customer. The vehicle routes are then constructed based on the customer priority list and the vehicle priority matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA)</title><p id="Par20">AHA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> is an optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior and unique flight patterns of hummingbirds. It belongs to the broader family of swarm-based metaheuristic methods and bio-inspired optimization algorithms, such as PSO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and ACO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, and is used to solve complex optimization problems across various fields. Compared to other algorithms, AHA offers advantages such as an effective balance between exploration and exploitation, rapid convergence rates, and fewer control parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The AHA consists of three main components: food sources, hummingbirds, and the visit table<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Food sources represent potential solutions to the optimization problem, while hummingbirds are the entities that explore the solution space, simulating the foraging behavior of real hummingbirds. Each hummingbird can exhibit three distinct types of foraging behavior: guided foraging, territorial foraging, and migrating foraging. Additionally, hummingbirds can display three types of flight pattern: axial flight, diagonal flight, and omnidirectional flight. These foraging behaviors and flight patterns combine to enable the hummingbirds to efficiently search for optimal solutions while avoiding premature convergence to suboptimal ones.</p><p id="Par21">The visit table is a critical component that manages the foraging process. It tracks the visit level for each food source across different hummingbirds. The visit level represents the amount of time since a specific hummingbird last visited a particular food source. The more frequently a food source is visited, the more likely it is to be a good solution. Frequent visits to a food source indicate that it is closer to the optimal solution. The visit table is updated during each iteration, with the visit levels recalculated based on the movements of the hummingbirds. This allows the algorithm to adapt to changing solution landscapes and refine the search process over time.</p><p id="Par22">In the context of the CVRP, the visit table plays a specialized role in guiding the construction and refinement of vehicle routes. Here, a food source represents a complete route configuration, including the assignment of customers to vehicles and the sequence in which food sources are visited, all subject to vehicle capacity constraints. Each hummingbird searches for improved route configurations by modifying existing ones, such as reassigning nodes between routes or reordering visit sequences, through its foraging strategies.</p><p id="Par23">In this setting, the visit table tracks how frequently a specific routing configuration has been explored. Frequent visits to a configuration may indicate a high-quality or promising solution, encouraging further local search (exploitation), whereas rarely visited configurations are prioritized for diversification (exploration). For example, if a particular customer is consistently assigned to the same vehicle and position within high-quality solutions, the algorithm may prioritize preserving that assignment. Conversely, if certain vehicle routes or customer groupings remain underexplored, the algorithm can deliberately steer the hummingbirds to investigate those areas of the search space, thereby enhancing global search diversity.</p><p id="Par24">Furthermore, the visit table facilitates adaptive learning by updating visit levels based on the actions of the hummingbirds in each iteration. When a hummingbird visits or generates a new solution, the corresponding visit level is reset, while the visit levels of other solutions are incremented. This mechanism enables the algorithm to dynamically shift its focus between intensifying the search for promising solutions and escaping local optima.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Evaluation metric</title><p id="Par25">The evaluation metric for optimal route analysis is based on the objective function, which, in this case, prioritizes minimizing the total travel distance. This minimization directly influences the number of trunk lines required and the overall cost. Specifically, the objective function seeks to reduce the total distance traveled by all vehicles, ensuring each route is as short as possible while still meeting all operational constraints. In practical applications, time is often a critical constraint, particularly in contexts where adherence to delivery schedules is essential. However, because time-related data was not available in this research, the focus remained on minimizing the distance, which is a common approach in route optimization problems such as the CVRP.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par26">To assess the performance of the proposed optimization approach, this section is organized into three parts: experimental setup, experimental results, and sensitivity analysis.

Emission sources with daily emission rates exceeding 30,000 liters are subdivided into multiple nodes due to the constraint (<xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>), each representing a portion of the total emissions and constrained to a maximum of 30,000 liters per day. Initially, each emission source was modeled as a single node, with its corresponding emission volume. However, to enable efficient vehicle routing and facilitate computational parallelism, sources exceeding the vehicle capacity were decomposed into multiple sub-nodes. Each sub-node retains the geographic coordinates of the original emission source but is assigned a daily emission rate not exceeding the vehicle limit. This subdivision ensures that each sub-node can be serviced by a single vehicle, thus simplifying capacity constraints in the routing problem. To maintain traceability and allow for accurate post-processing, each sub-node retains the identifier of its original emission source. Consequently, the maximum number of vehicles assigned to each cluster is equal to the number of all nodes within that cluster. This approach supports better load balancing, improves routing flexibility, and enhances the overall efficiency of the transportation network design.</p><p id="Par31">To convert the emission rate from Mt per year to liter per day, the value was first converted to kg per year by multiplying by 1,000,000. Next, the result was converted to liter per year by multiplying by 0.986<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Finally, this value was divided by 365 to obtain the emission rate in liter per day.</p><p id="Par32">For the AHA parameters, the population size and the maximum number of iterations were set to 50 and 10, respectively. These relatively low values were chosen due to computational resource limitations and the substantial increase in problem size resulting from the subdivision of emission sources. For instance, in the Suphanburi Cluster, the number of emission sources increased from 633 to 2,145 after applying the node division strategy. This expansion significantly increased the complexity of the routing problem, necessitating a trade-off between solution accuracy and computational feasibility. The output of the AHA is a permutation of nodes representing the sequence of customer locations (CO<sub>2</sub> emission sources) to be visited. This sequence is decoded into delivery routes by sequentially assigning customers to each vehicle, while ensuring that the vehicle capacity constraint is not violated. A new route is initiated once the cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> load exceeds the vehicle&#8217;s capacity. This process continues until all nodes are assigned. The optimal routes and the total travel distance were calculated using road network distances obtained from ORS Tools (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ORStools/">https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ORStools/</ext-link>), a QGIS plugin that utilizes the OpenRouteService API to retrieve data from OpenStreetMap (OSM).

Although the PSO algorithm yielded shorter paths than Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm, it was still less effective than AHA. The optimal distances determined by PSO, averaged over 20 iterations and measured from the sink to the sources and back, were 337,703.87 km for the Lampang Cluster, 3,628,440.22 km for the Nong Bua Cluster, 735,302.93 km for the Suphanburi Cluster, and 6,017,453.78 km for the Kra Cluster. In contrast, the optimal paths obtained using the AHA, averaged over 20 iterations and measured from the sink to the sources and back, demonstrated significant reductions in total distance. For example, in the Lampang Cluster, the total distance decreased to 328,719.15 km.

The ORS Tools plugin was employed to calculate the shortest path along the road network between specified coordinates. For the Kra Cluster, the total distance is significantly greater than that of the other clusters. This is primarily due to the geographical location of the Kra basin, which is situated in the Gulf of Thailand. All source points must route through the Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate, as it is the only location equipped with a direct pipeline system to the Kra basin. As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, sources located in the far southern region of Thailand are required to travel over 1,000 km one way to reach the Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate, contributing substantially to the overall distance. Additionally, in the Nong Bua Cluster, several sources are located near the Suphanburi Basin. However, due to the limited storage capacity of the Suphanburi Basin, these sources must rely on the Nong Bua Basin instead.

These mechanisms enable multiple agents (hummingbirds) to collaboratively converge on near-optimal or optimal paths by learning from each other and dynamically adjusting their exploration. This is particularly beneficial in complex networks where global optimization is more critical than just finding the shortest path between two nodes. Furthermore, AHA is more adaptable to real-world constraints, such as dynamic changes in travel conditions, clustered delivery zones, or non-linear distance functions, where deterministic algorithms like Dijkstra&#8217;s may not perform well. However, it is important to note that AHA generally requires more computational resources due to its iterative nature and dependency on algorithm parameters such as population size and number of iterations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p id="Par38">To evaluate the robustness and performance of the AHA, a sensitivity analysis was performed focusing on two key parameters: the number of iterations and the population size.

By simultaneously minimizing total travel distance and the number of vehicles, AHA offers a promising solution and design to enhance logistical efficiency and reduce operational costs. The results suggest that AHA outperforms traditional routing methods in addressing the complexities of CCS transport networks, highlighting its potential for practical implementation. Future research could focus on integrating real-time data and exploring multi-objective optimization to further improve transportation planning and sustainability in CCS operations. Before applying the AHA, source-sink matching for CCS is conducted using a constrained K-means clustering algorithm. This algorithm extends the conventional K-means method by integrating domain-specific constraints to guide the clustering process, ensuring more practical groupings of sources and sinks based on haversine distance. The optimization model is subject to two primary constraints: (i) each cluster must include at least one sink, and (ii) the total emission rate of the sources within a cluster must not exceed the injection capacity of the corresponding sink. To address this, the AHA, a bio-inspired metaheuristic, is employed. AHA is modeled on the unique foraging behavior of hummingbirds and incorporates three distinct foraging strategies along with directional navigational mechanisms. These features enable the algorithm to effectively balance exploration and exploitation within the solution space, making it particularly suitable for solving complex and constrained optimization problems such as CO<sub>2</sub> transportation network design.</p><p id="Par41">According to the dataset for CO<sub>2</sub> sources in Thailand obtained from a governmental agency, the emission sources encompass six major industrial sectors: cement, chemicals, food and beverages, iron-steel, power, and other industrial activities. The CO<sub>2</sub> storage sinks consist of four geological formations considered viable for long-term storage: the Lampang Basin, Nong Bua Basin, Suphanburi Basin, and Kra Basin. Experimental results show that AHA significantly outperforms Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm and PSO in reducing overall transportation distances within each cluster. The total distances computed using Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm for the Lampang, Nong Bua, Suphanburi, and Kra clusters were 360,831.27 km, 3,854,825.60 km, 825,599.44 km, and 6,446,821.96 km, respectively. While the PSO algorithm produced shorter routes than Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm, it remained less effective than AHA. In contrast, the AHA achieved total distances of 328,719.15 km, 3,535,078.30 km, 719,097.32 km, and 5,958,214.40 km for the respective clusters, corresponding to reductions of 8.90%, 8.29%, 12.90%, and 7.58%. Although the AHA involves higher computational costs, its effectiveness in improving route efficiency underscores its potential as a robust alternative to conventional shortest-path algorithms, particularly in applications related to logistics, transportation planning, and network design.</p><p id="Par42">Future research will incorporate additional real-world constraints such as pipeline construction costs, travel time, and geographic limitations to enhance the model&#8217;s practical applicability. A key direction involves developing a multi-objective optimization framework using Pareto efficiency or weighted objectives to address trade-offs among cost, distance, safety, and environmental impact. In particular, CCS routing decisions involve safety considerations, such as proximity to populations and terrain risks,&#160;which should be integrated into the routing logic. The logistics of CCS will also be modeled more realistically by accounting for heterogeneous fleets, vehicle capacities, time windows, road constraints, and multi-modal delivery options (e.g., truck-to-pipeline). Additionally, incorporating dynamic data, such as changing emission rates, new route availability, and regulatory changes, will enable adaptive decision-making and improve resilience in planning. Finally, validation on larger, more diverse datasets and benchmarking against other metaheuristic algorithms will be performed to assess the scalability, robustness, and generalizability of the proposed approach.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the Erawan High Performance Computing (HPC) Project, Information Technology Service Center (ITSC), Chiang Mai University.
