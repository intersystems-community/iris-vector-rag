FIPV is responsible for the severe disease known as feline infectious peritonitis, while FECV typically causes mild symptoms, such as diarrhea, and often does not lead to any disease at all. Currently, it is not possible to distinguish between FIPV and FECV at the molecular level. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the molecular features of FIPV. Here, we generated a recombinant virus by replacing the ORF1ab region and the coding sequence for the spike (S) protein of an FECV with the corresponding sequences from FIPVs. The recombinant virus (recFECV-S<sub>DF-2</sub>-1ab<sub>FIPV</sub>) exhibited similar growth kinetics to its parental strain. Our analysis revealed that the replacement of the ORF1ab in the FECV caused significant alterations in protein expression within the host cells. Furthermore, the presence of the ORF1ab from the FIPV strain resulted in enhanced suppression of the innate immune response compared to the parental strain, as determined through proteomic and transcriptomic studies. Additionally, we demonstrated that the papain-like protease 2 (PL2<sup>pro</sup>) of the non-structural protein 3 (NSP3) from both FIPV and FECV functions in immune suppression, and the protease activity is required for this function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>FCoVs</kwd><kwd>FECV</kwd><kwd>FIPV</kwd><kwd>ORF1ab</kwd><kwd>S protein</kwd><kwd>IFN-&#946;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>32370164</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund</funding-source><award-id>1610302022009</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 32370164), and Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund (No. 1610302022009), both provided to H.K.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-17-01282"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>FCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Coronavirus of the Coronaviridae [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The genome of FCoV is approximately 29 kilobases (kb) in length and contains seven open reading frames. These frames encode the polyprotein pp1ab (ORF1ab), which can be cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs), structural proteins such as the spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N), and accessory proteins (ORF3 and ORF7). FCoVs can be categorized into two biotypes based on the clinical symptoms they cause: feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FECV often causes enteritis or is asymptomatic, while FIPV leads to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a severe and often fatal disease with a mortality rate reaching 100% without treatment. FCoVs are also classified into two genotypes: type I and type II. Type I FCoVs are widely distributed in nature, while type II FCoVs occur less frequently [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Epidemiological surveys have shown that type II arises from recombination between type I FCoVs and canine coronavirus (CCoV). Compared to type I FCoVs, type II FCoVs are easier to culture in vitro, which is why most research on FIP and FIPV focuses on type II FCoVs. Both genotypes can belong to either the FECV or FIPV biotype.</p><p>Although low-pathogenicity FCoV is highly contagious, only a small percentage of infected cats develop clinical FIP, and only a few FIP-affected cats shed FIPV [<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Multiple studies have indicated that FIPV strains are more closely related to FCoVs found in fecal samples of cats living in the same environment but not to the FIPV isolates in other locations [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of FIPV strains from different cats in the same household reveals unique genetic signatures, suggesting independent emergence of the virus in each feline host [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, oral inoculation of healthy cats with FIPV is not efficient in causing the development of FIP [<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, the likelihood of horizontal transmission of FIPV is low, although it is possible [<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The factors contributing to FIPV outbreaks in multi-cat environments are likely diverse [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism underlying the development and pathogenesis of FIPV is not clear. Like all coronaviruses, the FCoV genome shows high genetic variability. It has been proposed that mutations in the spike (S) gene, along with accessory genes 3c and 7b, may play a role in this process [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but subsequent research has not fully validated these claims [<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recent studies, for instance, have demonstrated that inserting the S protein from virulent type II FIPV into the backbone of low-virulence type I FECV does not change the biotype of the virus [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, recombinant virulent viruses with an S protein from a low-virulence type II virus continue to exhibit high virulence [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These findings suggest that the virulence of FIPV does not depend solely on the S protein. Instead, it is likely that a combination of multiple mutations plays a role in the pathogenesis of FIP. Some studies have suggested that antibody-dependent enhancement plays an important role in the development of FIP [<xref rid="B18-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, this phenomenon is not often observed under natural conditions [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The currently accepted theory on the pathogenesis of FIPV suggests that when cats are infected with FCoV, the accumulation of viral genetic mutations alters the target cells of the virus from intestinal epithelial cells to monocytes/macrophages, leading to FIP development. However, others argue that FECV and FIPV are two distinct types of FCoV that circulate independently within cat populations [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that highly virulent strains of certain viruses can replicate more effectively in monocytes and macrophages [<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Additionally, the occurrence of FIP is associated with significant reductions in both natural killer cells and regulatory T cells, indicating that both innate immunity and adaptive immunity are being suppressed [<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Recent studies indicate that the type II FIPV (DF2 strain) fails to induce the production of IFN &#946; and suppresses the IFN &#946; production induced by Sendai virus (SeV) or polyinosinic&#8211;polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This suppression is closely related to the activity of non-structural protein NSP5, which disrupts the type I interferon signaling pathway by cleaving NEMO through its protease activity. In addition to NSP5, the NSP1 of FIPV plays a critical role in inhibiting the host immune response [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the immune suppression activities of FIPV are not claimed to be a unique feature that differentiates it from FECV.</p><p>In this study, we constructed a recombinant virus of recFECV-S<sub>DF-2</sub>-1ab<sub>FIPV</sub>, in which the ORF1ab region was replaced with the corresponding region from an FIPV. Our findings revealed that the ORF1ab of FIPV exhibits a stronger ability to suppress innate immunity. Additionally, we discovered that the PL2<sup>pro</sup> of NSP3 has a strong inhibitory ability in interferon production, and this inhibitory effect is dependent on its deubiquitinase activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-17-01282"><title>2.

Clinically, cases of FIP can be categorized as either effusive (wet) or non-effusive (dry). Effusive cases are characterized by the presence of ascites, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion, while non-effusive cases often present with multiple pyogranulomas. Mixed forms can also occur. In the case of diagnostics, although immunohistochemical staining (IHC) for detecting the virus in infected tissues is considered an effective method for laboratory confirmation of FIP [<xref rid="B37-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], this approach does not enable in vivo detection, particularly in cases where ascites is not produced, making clinical diagnosis more challenging. Therefore, it is urgent to determine the genetic features of FIPV, which will favor the development of molecular diagnostic tools.</p><p>In this study, we found that the presence of the ORF1ab derived from an FIPV strain enhanced the immune suppression activity of the virus in both CRFK and Fcwf-4 cells. This finding provides new insights into the biological features of FIPV. A previous study revealed that interferon production is differentially induced when Fcwf-4 cells are infected with various virus strains. In that study, the virulent strains (79-1146, identical to DF-2 and UCD-1) exhibited stronger inhibitory effects on interferon expression, although an avirulent strain (79-1683) demonstrated a similar capability [<xref rid="B25-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It would be interesting to investigate whether the enhanced immune suppression caused by ORF1ab is a general feature of FIPVs and whether it occurs in vivo.</p><p>In addition, it has been suggested that mutations in the FECV genome lead to biotype conversion of the virus [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, this hypothesis remains unverified, partly due to a lack of understanding of the distinct biological characteristics of FIPV and because studies on the pathogenesis of the virus largely rely on animal challenge experiments. A previous study reported that a chimeric type I FCoV containing sequences derived from type II FIPV, including ORF1b and S, 3a, 3b, and 3c, failed to induce clinical signs of FIP, indicating that these sequences are not sufficient to enhance pathogenicity [<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This suggests that other sequences may play a role in defining the distinct biological characteristics of the viruses. It would be more interesting to investigate whether the enhanced suppression of the innate immune response by ORF1ab of FIPV is related to the pathogenesis of the virus through animal challenge experiments.</p><p>In previous studies, NSP1 and NSP5 of FIPV were shown to play important roles in evading the innate immune response [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our current study, we also found that NSP1 exhibits an inhibitory effect on the innate immune response. However, NSP5 derived from the current strain of FIPV did not demonstrate any inhibitory function. Instead, we identified that PL2<sup>pro</sup> fulfills the role of inhibiting IFN-&#946; production. These findings suggest that the inhibitory effects may be strain-specific. Our data revealed that expression of PL2<sup>pro</sup> could inhibit the activation of the IFN-&#946; promoter stimulated by overexpression of RIG-1 or MDA5, which indicated that the target protein of PL2<sup>pro</sup> might exist downstream of the RNA sensors. However, PL2<sup>pro</sup> in other coronaviruses has been reported to have multiple targets for mediating innate immune evasion [<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-17-01282" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, multiple mechanisms might exist for the role of PL2<sup>pro</sup> in regulating the innate immune response. Unfortunately, our data showed that the PL2<sup>pro</sup> from both FIPV and FECV functions in immune suppression. Thus, detailed mapping within the ORF1ab using recombinant viruses with exchanged fragments of FIPV and FECV is still necessary for further investigation to identify the core factors associated with ORF1ab that contribute to this immune suppression role.</p><p>In summary, we have successfully constructed a recombinant virus harboring the ORF1ab from a virulent FIPV strain. Our findings suggest that ORF1ab from FIPV possesses a unique feature related to immune suppression. It remains unclear why ORF1ab exhibits an enhanced inhibitory function in innate immune responses, especially since PL2<sup>pro</sup> from FECV and FIPV exhibits similar inhibitory effects. Therefore, additional investigation is needed to address this issue.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Natalay Kouprina and Vladimir Larionov from the Laboratory of Biosystems and Cancer, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA, for kindly providing the <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> VL6-48N strain.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
