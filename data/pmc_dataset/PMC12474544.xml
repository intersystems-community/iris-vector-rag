</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Commentary</title><p id="Par9">This study by Leghrouz et al. examines the role of differential learning in tooth brushing, an emerging approach in oral health education<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Traditional tooth brushing instruction often involves a motor learning approach based on repetition and corrective instruction to achieve competence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Differential learning involves maximal variation of the movement to stimulate the learner to find their optimal performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. For example, in the study by Leghrouz et al., participants in the test group were asked to perform tooth brushing with nine different exercises such as while lying down, with the non-dominant hand, and with closed eyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Differential learning has been successfully applied to the training of sport techniques and handwriting, and recent studies are beginning to explore a possible role in tooth brushing education<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">The study by Leghrouz et al. has many strengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The CONSORT checklist and the RoB-2 risk of bias tool were utilised in the study conception phase to assure quality and minimise bias. Sample size calculations were undertaken based on previous similar studies, a process of randomisation was put in place to assign participants to groups, and investigators were blinded as regards the participant groups. Investigators were trained and calibrated in the indices used in the study, with very good agreement being achieved for both inter-examiner and intra-examiner weighted kappa scores. Finally, the distribution of dropouts was analysed and dropout-related bias was found to be unlikely.</p><p id="Par11">However, it is suggested that there are a number of issues relating to this study that the reader should take into consideration when interpreting and applying the findings. The authors acknowledge that, as children of this age are usually assisted by their parents while brushing, parental involvement should be taken into account when interpreting results. Following on from this, the exclusion criteria did not include factors that might impact on tooth brushing ability, such as children or parents with impaired manual dexterity. Unlike a similar study by Pabel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, the present study did not standardise the type of toothbrush and toothpaste used across groups, although the authors report no statistically significant differences regarding the type of brush used. It is also important to highlight that compliance was assessed by asking the participants to place a sticker on a sheet for every day they brushed according to instructions. There is a possibility of misreporting of compliance with this method, and in the present study only 13 of the 22 participants in the control group and 18 of the 24 participants in the test group filled and returned the sticker sheet.</p><p id="Par12">The authors acknowledge the possible impact that the Hawthorn effect may have had on the findings. As the reader will know, the Hawthorn effect is a phenomenon whereby research participants may change their behaviour simply because of the fact that they are being observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In the present study, it is possible that both groups may have altered their brushing behaviour for this reason. However, while participants in both groups showed significant improvements in oral hygiene at the first recall, the results were preserved at the second recall only for the differential learning (test) group. The authors also mention that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in delays to the planned schedule for the first and second follow-up appointments, with mean values for the second follow-up of 19.4&#8201;+&#8201;/- 7 weeks in the control group and 20.1&#8201;+&#8201;/- 8.1 weeks in the test group. The variability in follow-up periods needs to be taken into consideration when interpreting findings, although the authors suggest that a longer follow-up time possibly led to clearer conclusions.</p><p id="Par13">This research builds on the recommendations of previous research by Pabel et al. that differential learning should be studied in children with poor oral hygiene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. While it is suggested that there are a number of issues that should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results, the study by Leghrouz et al. concludes that differential learning may have a role in improving oral hygiene in the medium term. As is so often the case, further research is needed, such as on the effectiveness of differential learning in the longer term and on the impact of the technique on actual disease levels. The practicality of the technique will also need consideration, as ideally it should easily assimilate into day-to-day living. In conclusion, while it may not yet be time to change how we practice tooth brushing instruction, the differential learning approach merits further exploration and may in time play a role in oral health education.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Practice Points</label><p id="Par14">
