Objective: To address the challenge of inducing strictly serotype-specific immune responses, this study explored the use of targeting individual lymph nodes (LNs) for the creation of simultaneous but independent immune responses as a targeted approach to reduce cross-reactivity and improve vaccine specificity. Methods: In the initial experiments, targeting individual LN successfully induced specific germinal centers (GCs) for different antigens in distinct LNs, highlighting its potential to enhance immune specificity. This approach was further tested using two virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccines based on AP205 for DENV1 and DENV4, selected due to their genetic divergence and to probe the potential to minimize cross-reactive immune responses. In this setup, AP205-DV1 and AP205-DV4 were administered in targeted separate LNs, and the specificity of the immune response was compared to subcutaneous administration of a mixture of both vaccines. Results: Our data show that targeting distinct LNs elicited antibodies with significantly higher avidity, which is a critical factor in determining the neutralizing capacity of the immune response. Avidity measurements confirmed that this segregation approach results in a more refined selection of high-affinity B cells. Neutralization experiments demonstrated that targeting distinct LNs with individual vaccines induced a more potent and serotype-specific neutralizing response, compared to the injection of a vaccine mixture. Conclusions: These findings suggest that targeting individual LNs could be a promising method for enhancing both the specificity and potency of immune responses, particularly for flaviviruses. Targeting distinct LNs by direct administration of individual vaccines into distinct watersheds rather than individual lymph nodes will offer the opportunity to facilitate the approach in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dengue</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>lymph node</kwd><kwd>virus</kwd><kwd>flaviviruses</kwd><kwd>virus-like particle</kwd><kwd>VLP</kwd><kwd>AP205</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)</funding-source><award-id>10001271</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) to M.F.B. and P.E, grant number 10001271.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-13-00941"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite extensive efforts, effective and universally applicable vaccines have remained elusive, highlighting the need for innovative approaches to vaccination strategies. Many viral species exhibit high genetic variability, which allows them to evade virus-neutralizing antibody responses [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A more evolved strategy for immune evasion, as is the case for dengue, is the creation of distinct serotypes, which resulted in the emergence of four dengue serotypes [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This serotype diversity complicates the induction of protective immune responses, as cross-reactive, non-neutralizing antibodies can lead to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. ADE facilitates viral entry into host cells via Fc&#947; receptors, increasing replication and potentially causing more severe disease [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This phenomenon poses challenges for dengue vaccine development, requiring a vaccine to elicit a protective response against all four serotypes with minimal induction of cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies. Hence, in the case of dengue, the goal is to simultaneously induce highly specific antibodies singularly recognizing one of the four existing serotypes with insignificant cross-reactivity. Previous antigenic exposure can influence the induction of specific antibodies for multiple dengue serotypes [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Upon infection with a new dengue serotype, the immune system preferentially activates memory B cells generated from a previous infection. These memory B cells produce antibodies specific to the initial serotype, thereby restricting the production of new serotype-specific antibodies. This phenomenon, known as original antigenic sin or molecular imprinting, complicates the development of effective vaccines targeting all four dengue serotypes. Furthermore, simultaneous immunization against all serotypes tends to favor the induction of cross-reactive B cells, as these cells are more likely to recognize and respond to antigens from all four serotypes. Consequently, both sequential immunization and immunization with a cocktail of serotype-specific vaccines promote the production of antibodies targeting cross-reactive epitopes [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In a previous study, we tried to overcome this challenge by developing virus-like particles (VLP)-based DENV vaccines that display the Domain III (EDIII) of the envelope protein rather than the entire envelope protein, since EDIII has fewer cross-reactive epitopes and is highly serotype-specific; the vaccine candidates indeed induced a potent and specific neutralizing antibody response [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Their nanoparticle size of 20&#8211;200 nm allows them to efficiently reach draining lymph nodes (dLNs), inducing strong innate and adaptive immune responses across various species [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To accommodate the larger EDIII domain, we genetically fused or chemically coupled the EDIII of the 4 DENV serotypes to AP205-VLPs with two monomers fused, resulting in 90 rather than 180 N/C-termini, presenting a sterically optimized VLP, as described in our previous study [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In a previous study, we demonstrated that simultaneous vaccination with a tetravalent mixture of serotype-specific VLP vaccines could induce a potent humoral immune response able to efficiently neutralize all four DENV serotypes without enhancing DENV-2 replication [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, studies on the induction of cross-reactive antibodies by the vaccines revealed considerable cross-reactivity. Since all four vaccines are presented to the immune system and are available to follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in GCs, we still expect a preferential induction of cross-reactive B cells.</p><p>This study presents a novel approach to improve serotype-specific responses to anti-EDIII vaccines by inducing specially segregated immune responses by targeting individual LNs with individual serotype-specific vaccine candidates. As a proof-of-concept, we immunized with two dengue serotypes, DENV-1 and DENV-4. These represent the most genetically and antigenically distant serotypes, making them suitable to investigate the mechanisms underlying the immune response induced by lymph node-targeted vaccination. Since LNs function as independent entities, particularly those in separate areas [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], it is possible to simultaneously induce a distinct, independent immune response in individual LN regions. This approach allows for the concurrent induction of highly serotype-specific B-cell responses within the same host. Therefore, targeting individual LNs presents a promising strategy for eliciting uniquely serotype-specific immune responses, making it a potentially effective approach for dengue vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-13-00941"><title>2.

The mice were anaesthetized with 50 &#181;L/25 g mice of anaesthesia mix s.c. (Dormitor 1 mg/mL, Dormicum 5 mg/mL, Fentanyl 0.05 mg/mL). After waiting 7&#8211;10 min until the mice were completely anaesthetized, Ophthalmic ointment (e.g., Paralube<sup>&#174;</sup> or Lacrilube<sup>&#174;</sup>) was applied to the mice&#8217;s eyes to avoid drying out of the cornea. To ensure that the mouse was sufficiently anaesthetized, we pinched its foot or toe with a finger. If no reflexes were detected, we proceeded with the procedure. If reflexes were detected, we waited an extra 5 min and checked the mouse again. The mouse was placed on its back, the area for surgery (inguinal region) was shaved (with cream or trimmer), and disinfection was carried out with Betadine. The hip joint was bent to approximately a 90&#176; angle, and a small incision of &lt;5 mm through the skin was made using sterile curved micro-dissecting forceps and a surgical scissor. The incision was widened using the tip of the surgical scissors, which tore the skin to about 10 mm. The inguinal lymph node was localized and immobilized using the curved forceps and the surgical scissors. The inguinal lymph node appeared greyish within the surrounding fat tissue. Using an insulin syringe (0.5 mL, 30 G), 10 &#181;L of the vaccine was directly injected into the inguinal lymph node. If the lymph node was getting swollen, the injection was assumed successful. The incision was sealed using sterile 9 mm wound clips inserted into a 9 mm Auto-clip applier. Clips were removed after 10&#8211;12 days.

Tissue sections, 8 &#181;m thick, were cut using a cryostat (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and placed onto Superfrost Plus glass slides (Epredia, Campus Dr, Kalamazoo, MI, USA), where they were allowed to dry overnight at room temperature before staining. The sections were fixed by immersing them in 100% cold acetone for 10 min at 4 &#176;C. Following fixation, they were air-dried, and a SuperHT PAP Pen (biotium, Landing Parkway, Fremont, CA, USA) was used to encircle the sections. Sections were air-dried for 10 min, then rehydrated by incubating in PBS for 5 min. To block nonspecific binding, 100 &#181;L of blocking buffer (1% BSA and 1% normal mouse serum in PBS) was applied to each section and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The excess blocking buffer was removed by gently blotting the edge of the slide on paper towels. Then, 90 &#181;L of primary antibody (bio-PNA diluted 1:500 in PBS with 1% NMS and 0.1% BSA) was applied to each section, and the slides were incubated for 60 min in the dark when fluorescently labelled antibodies were used.

Neutralization is a commonly used measurement of vaccine efficacy, as it directly reflects the functional capacity of antibodies to prevent viral infection [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. <xref rid="vaccines-13-00941-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> compares the neutralization efficiency of sera from mice vaccinated into individual LNs or subcutaneously against DENV1 and DENV4 across multiple dilutions (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00941-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). The data demonstrate that targeting individual LNs induces a more consistent and potent neutralizing response (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.0085) compared to s.c. immunized mice, in particular for DENV4. For DENV1, we observed a similar neutralization efficacy (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.2924) between the LN-targeted and s.c. immunized groups among all the dilutions. Especially against DENV4, we can observe a more consistent neutralization induced by targeting individual LNs in contrast to s.c. immunization (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00941-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-vaccines-13-00941"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>DENV is one of the most threatening and widespread mosquito-borne viral infections, affecting millions of people each year, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The disease presents a significant global health burden, with nearly half the world&#8217;s population at risk of infection [<xref rid="B26-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A major challenge in dengue vaccine development is the presence of four distinct serotypes [<xref rid="B27-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], where immunity to one does not protect against the others and can even increase the risk of severe disease through ADE [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Hence, a key goal in dengue vaccine development is to induce a highly specific and potent immune response that effectively neutralizes each serotype while minimizing cross-reactivity that could lead to ADE [<xref rid="B29-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Achieving this requires innovative strategies that promote the generation of serotype-specific antibodies with high avidity and neutralizing capacity. Here, we show that targeting individual LNs with individual vaccines offers a promising approach to enhance the precision of the immune response, allowing for the induction of more focused germinal centers and higher-quality antibodies specific to each tested dengue serotype. By ensuring that antigens are delivered directly to distinct LNs, an LN-targeted injection can enhance the specificity of germinal center formation, minimizing cross-reactive antibody responses due to the absence of selection of B cells that react to both serotypes in the same GC (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00941-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-13-00941" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Indeed, targeting individual LNs by vaccination offered a significant advantage by focusing the immune response on the specific antigen, or in this case, serotype-specific EDIII, presented in each LN, causing higher avidity and better neutralizing antibody responses. This suggests that the LN targeted route allows for more specific germinal center reactions, driving affinity maturation more efficiently to a single neutralizing specificity. The focused antigen presentation on follicular dendritic cells in individual LNs likely plays a role in enhancing this process by ensuring that antigen-specific B cells are selected for affinity maturation without interference from cross-reactive responses (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00941-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). This is particularly important in viruses with high cross-reactivity between serotypes like dengue, where affinity maturation could otherwise be hindered by the presence of broadly reactive but low-affinity B cells stimulated by multiple EDIII domains simultaneously. Moreover, targeting individual LNs by vaccination may help to overcome the phenomenon of original antigenic sin or molecular imprinting, where the immune system preferentially recalls memory B cells from previous infections rather than generating new, serotype-specific responses. By directing antigens to separate lymph nodes, vaccination could encourage the generation of new B cell clones that are specific to the presented serotype rather than activating cross-reactive memory B cells from a previous infection. This could lead to the production of more serotype-specific antibodies and reduce the interference caused by prior immunity. Further testing in animal challenge models will be necessary to evaluate whether this approach can protect against all four dengue serotypes. In addition, dedicated studies will be required to formally demonstrate that this strategy does not promote antibody-dependent enhancement. A further limitation of the present work is that we focused on proof-of-concept immunogenicity against DENV-1 and DENV-4 rather than assessing the durability of the induced immune responses in the context of other serotypes or different mixtures of serotypes.</p><p>Conclusion: Targeting individual lymph nodes for dengue vaccination enhances germinal center specificity and affinity maturation, leading to higher-avidity, serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies. Injecting individual LNs in the field for vaccination against DENV is an obvious practical obstacle. However, using adjuvants forming local depots or harnessing natural watersheds in the immune system may be promising and straightforward solutions for the realistic development of such a vaccination strategy in humans. Furthermore, this strategy may not only be attractive for DENV but also other flaviviruses and viruses in general that are thought to cause enhanced disease due to cross-reactive antibodies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Schematics were created with BioRender.com as stated in the figure legends.
