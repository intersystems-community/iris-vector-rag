Here, we investigate the link between unresolved parenchymal inflammation and cellular senescence in MS progression. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of human brain tissue reveals an accumulation of senescent-like glial cells in diseased white matter, especially in chronic active lesions, and to a lesser extent in the cortex. Spatial transcriptomics show gradients of senescence-like signatures extending from lesion cores to periplaque regions, alongside rewired cellular networks. Experimental induction of senescence in MS hiPSC-derived neural organoids demonstrates that microglia are especially vulnerable to inflammation-induced senescence, which can be partially rescued by CNS-penetrant anti-inflammatory drugs. At the patient level (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;466), increased 3T MRI-estimated brain-age is observed, especially in individuals with more than four chronic active lesions. These findings suggest that chronic inflammation might accelerate senescence-like processes, potentially contributing to disease progression, and that its modulation might help limit further propagation.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">In multiple sclerosis, smoldering inflammation contributes to clinical progression.

Through single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) blueprinting, we recently highlighted the coexistence at the chronic active lesion edge of self-sustaining glia-mediated pathological processes as well as, to a lesser extent, resident lymphocyte-driven inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In this work, we asked whether cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, a cellular state featuring permanent cell-cycle arrest and inflammatory secretome (senescence-associated secretory phenotype or SASP), is among the relevant self-propagating pathological processes disrupting tissue homeostasis and its reparative capacity in chronic active lesions, as well as in other MS brain tissue. Using single-cell transcriptomic data from human autopsy brains (including snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics), we identified subsets of senescent-like cells with cell-type and regional specificity in the brains of relatively young individuals with progressive MS. Strategic brain tissue sampling enabled the investigation of white matter (WM), cortex, and different lesion pathological stages, separately. To dissect some of the drivers of this cellular program in MS, we developed an inflamed human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoid model to experimentally study and modulate inflammation-induced cellular senescence-like processes in vitro.</p><p id="Par5">Finally, in the absence of definite in vivo biomarkers indicative of cellular senescence in the living brains of MS patients, we applied the MRI-estimated brain age paradigm. This macroscopic approach provides a global estimation of the brain&#8217;s structural integrity, extending beyond brain volume. Since we identified senescent-like cells in chronic active lesions, we specifically investigated whether, at the patient level, MS patients with a high burden of MRI-visible chronic active lesions (PRL) also exhibit an increased MRI-estimated brain age and the corresponding likelihood of disease progression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Senescent-like cells show regional and cell-type vulnerability in the MS brain</title><p id="Par6">We investigated the regional and cell-type specificity of senescent-like cells in the MS brain.

The accumulation of senescent cells, which undergo stable cell cycle arrest and produce a distinct senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), has been reported in age-related diseases, where they actively promote low-grade tissue inflammation and further disruption of tissue homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Senescent growth arrest requires coordinated action of the p53/p21 and p16INK4A/retinoblastoma pathways. Key features of senescent cells include prolonged DNA damage signaling, increase in senescence-associated &#946;-galactosidase activity, and nuclear loss of lamin B1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> or HMGB1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par47">A recent international consensus statement highlighted the risks of relying on one single biomarker to identify cellular senescent cells. Therefore, we leveraged advanced single-cell genomics techniques (both snRNAseq and spatial transcriptomics) and histopathological validation for multiple hallmarks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> to investigate cellular senescence in MS brains with high-resolution granularity. By applying validated senescence signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> to our expanded snRNAseq human dataset, we identified subsets of senescent-like cells with cell-type and regional specificity in the brains of relatively young individuals with progressive MS (mean age 51 years). Among different CNS cell types, specific subpopulations of microglia, endothelia, and astrocytes showed transcriptional signatures of cellular senescence, particularly in WM areas affected by smoldering inflammation. Importantly, while these cellular subsets exhibit an overall inflammatory secretome (SASP), our data showed that they do not fully overlap with specific disease-associated inflammatory cellular states (i.e., only 30% of MIMS-foamy were senescent).</p><p id="Par48">In terms of CNS regionality, we discovered that, in MS, senescent-like cells are prevalent in the WM than in cortical regions, potentially indicating a differential response of the brain tissue to the inflammatory injury. In line with this finding, major morphological and transcriptional differences were recently highlighted for glial cells in different microenvironments in MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. For example, in the WM, higher and prolonged microglia inflammatory responses to injury were seen when compared to the affected (demyelinated) cortical environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In our study, along the lesion pathological stage trajectory, the presence of senescent-like cells was especially pronounced at the edges of chronic active lesions, indicating a potential association between inflammation-driven senescence and lesion pathology. In this regard, in chronic active lesions, the mechanisms underlying MS treatment-refractory chronic inflammation occurring behind a partially closed BBB are not fully elucidated and not properly targeted. We previously suggested the coexistence of self-sustaining, glia-mediated pathological processes and, to a lesser extent, resident lymphocyte-driven inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Our data support the idea that cellular senescence-like processes might be among those self-autonomous glial processes in MS tissue.</p><p id="Par49">After identifying senescence cell-type specificity and their patterned spatial localization, a critical question remained about whether cellular senescence is a beneficial or detrimental response to injury in the context of MS tissue. To address this question, we opted for three different approaches. The first approach was indirect, evaluating the presence of a centrifugal gradient of cellular senescence transcriptional signatures in the human MS brain tissue starting from demyelinated plaques, using spatial transcriptomic analysis. Gradients of senescence-like signatures extending from lesion cores to the surrounding periplaque were observed in older lesions (i.e., chronic active and inactive lesions), but not in the new actively demyelinating ones, indicating that cellular senescence might play a detrimental role by participating in chronic non-remitting inflammation, thereby contributing to tissue dysfunction. In line with our evidence, macroscopic gradients of tissue pathology were identified using in vivo MRI, focusing mostly on the CSF-gradient interfaces and diffusible molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Thus, we suggest that intrinsic pathological processes (e.g., cellular senescence) might also contribute to the interpretation of these data. The second approach was to assess how the presence of senescent-like cells can rewire the cellular networks in tissue. By differential snRNAseq- and spatial transcriptomics-informed cell-cell communication analysis, we demonstrated increased intercellular signaling, mostly mediated by increased senescent cell-related ligands, in MS tissue, confirming that senescent-like cells can strongly affect cell communication and critically shape the surrounding microenvironment.</p><p id="Par50">The third approach was to investigate the detrimental vs. beneficial role of cellular senescence in MS employing a hiPSC-derived 3D organoid model. Lately, hiPSC-derived models have been increasingly used to study neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. One published study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and one preprint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> have investigated cellular senescence in NPCs from MS hiPSCs. Since the presence and the role of NPCs in adult tissue are controversial, we decided to investigate cellular senescence in a more complex MS hiPSC-derived organoid model consisting of differentiated CNS cell types (astrocytes, neurons, oligodendroglia, and microglia). In our study, we found that inflammation-induced by a complex MS-relevant stimulus, in this case, inflamed CSF from untreated MS patients (as well as a cocktail of MS-associated inflammatory cytokines, but not immunoglobulins), triggered cellular senescence-like processes, suggesting inflammation&#8217;s role in driving this process. This result led us to hypothesize that inflammation-driven senescence-like events may occur early in MS pathology. Over time, these senescent-like cells may contribute to non-relapsing, compartmentalized inflammation by impairing critical cellular functions (such as inefficient debris removal from senescent-like microglia) and by secreting SASP. SASP can negatively impact the functionality of neighboring CNS cells through the secretion of proinflammatory growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, thereby promoting proinflammatory cellular phenotypes that lessen tissue regenerative capacity.</p><p id="Par51">Building on our previous investigation, which showed that microglia act as the initial responders to inflamed MS CSF in our glia-enriched organoid system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, we pursued a therapeutic strategy by pharmacologically manipulating upstream microglia-mediated inflammation to counteract accelerated cellular senescence-like processes and its role in low-grade neuroinflammation. Specifically, we selected drugs known to potentially affect MS-specific neurodegenerative glial populations. These included: (1) ibudilast, a phosphodiesterase type 4 and macrophage MIF inhibitor, previously tested in a phase 2 clinical trial where it reduced brain atrophy, though not new lesion accrual, and identified in our in silico microglia-drug interaction analysis using human snRNAseq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>; (2) R-&#945;-lipoic acid for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (with an ongoing clinical trial, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT03161028">NCT03161028</ext-link>); and (3) tolebrutinib, a brain-penetrant BTK inhibitor known to modulate both B cell and microglia activity. In our in vitro model, tolebrutinib was also able to significantly reduce CSF-driven MBP<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocyte toxicity. Of note, tolebrutinib was recently reported to delay the time to 6-month confirmed disability progression by 31% in a phase 3 clinical trial of non-relapsing secondary progressive MS, compared to placebo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. A recent post-hoc analysis of this trial showed that this protective effect was significantly seen in those patients with PRL compared to those without<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Our results demonstrated that these drugs partially halted inflammation-driven cellular senescence-like processes and that our glia-enriched organoids might serve as a relevant platform for studying drug effects on human CNS-like tissue, potentially complementing animal preclinical testing and aiding in prioritizing drugs for phase 2 clinical trials. As reference, these results were also compared with the organoid treatment with dasatinib, which was included as a positive control due to its well-known senolytic properties. In a recent animal study, depletion of senescent-like cells using senolytics was shown to reduce the severity of EAE symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par52">Finally, in the absence of definitive in vivo biomarkers indicative of cellular senescence in the living brains of MS patients, we applied the MRI-estimated brain age paradigm.

Our findings showed that the presence of chronic active lesions (seen on MRI as PRL) was associated with higher MRI-estimated brain-age gap in MS patients compared to those without PRL. These results align with the observed clinical outcomes, with patients harboring PRL exhibiting higher disability scores and reaching these milestones at a comparatively younger chronological age, emphasizing the clinical relevance of both smoldering inflammation in MS progression.

In contrast, our single-cell genomic human studies and hiPSC modelling specifically focused on cellular features and transcriptomic profiles reminiscent of inflammation-induced cellular senescence, which is not synonymous with aging. Moreover, the disentanglement of chronic inflammation from cellular senescence-associated pathways might be incomplete, considering the SenMayo gene signature includes inflammatory genes as part of the SASP. Our results, however, have been confirmed and validated using the SIT bioinformatic tool, which defines senescent cells based on cell cycle arrest and a small gene list (<italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A, CDKN2B, IL23A, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, SERPINE1</italic>). Beyond that, our bioinformatics approaches combined both unsupervised and supervised methods chosen depending on the research question and bioinformatic tool availability. For instance, alongside unsupervised analysis, we also used SPATA2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> to analyze spatial transcriptomics data along user-defined, manually drawn trajectories within limited tissue areas and on individual slices only, without aggregating the data. This manual process might have introduced bias, potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings. Our in vitro experiments on a patient-derived neural organoid model relied on a limited number of MS hiPSC lines (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;3), which might limit the generalization of our results. Although axonal myelination was observed, the poor myelin compaction and lack of typical brain cytoarchitecture represent significant limitations of the neural organoid model. Finally, the survival of hiPSC-derived microglia once engrafted within the neural organoid spans only a few weeks, which restricts the possibility of chronic inflammatory stimulation of this system. Further development of this patient-derived cellular model, as well as validation of our results, would be desirable in future work.</p><p id="Par54">Overall, our results suggest that in MS, the immediate response to brain injury might trigger detrimental, long-lasting effects. During the initial stages of demyelination and tissue injury, the activation of senescence-associated pathways might hinder the further proliferation of microglia and other glial cell types, particularly in the presence of a lymphocyte-driven inflammatory environment. In line with this, a recent paper reported astrocytic and ependymal senescence before the onset of MRI-visible demyelination in a marmoset EAE model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, long-term senescence could contribute to sustained low-grade neuroinflammation, impaired repair processes, and the progressive spread of tissue damage over time, exacerbating the progression of MS pathology (schematic interpretative framework in Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). In line, a recent EAE mouse study demonstrated that senescent-like microglia limit remyelination through the SASP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. These findings suggest potential clinical implications, pointing to chronic inflammation and cellular senescence pathways as areas of future interest for possibly slowing MS progression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Ethical compliance for human tissue studies</title><p id="Par55">This research complies with all relevant ethical regulations and has been approved by the ethical committee of IRCSS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy (IRB 45/INT/2021 and 137/2021).

The quantification of the senescent cells was performed by counting the nuclei with a module score greater than the imposed threshold. Briefly, the distribution of the senescent score was grouped by cluster per tissue type (WM vs. cortex) and lesion pathological stage condition. Since distinct CNS cell types had different senescence score distributions independently from the patient group of origin (non-neurological controls vs. MS), for counting purposes, we defined an arbitrary, tailored threshold of senescence for each CNS cell type based on the top 10% of nuclei with the highest senescence scores in the control cortex. For each CNS cell type, MS nuclei with a senescence score greater than the threshold were labelled as senescent.

Volcano plots were generated by plotting the log&#8322;(fold change) between two cell populations on the <italic toggle="yes">x</italic>-axis and the negative log&#8321;&#8320; of the adjusted <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value on the <italic toggle="yes">y</italic>-axis (only genes with adjusted <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 were included). See the dedicated paragraph for details on the snRNA-seq bioinformatic analysis. Differentially expressed genes were defined as those significantly expressed (adjusted <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 for multiple comparisons) in &#8805;25% of cell populations, with an average log-fold difference &gt;0.25 between groups of nuclei. Additional statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software v9.0). Statistical methods were not used to recalculate or predetermine sample sizes.</p><p id="Par93">Graphical objects in Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, d</xref>, <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10a</xref> as well as in Supplementary Figs.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c, f</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref> were created with BioRender.com (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://BioRender.com/d0hxq2g">https://BioRender.com/d0hxq2g</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec56"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par94">Further information on research design is available in the&#160;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec57" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
