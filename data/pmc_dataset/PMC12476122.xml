In doing so, it is important to mark his contribution to the Journal. During his tenure, David oversaw the publication of an eclectic mix of original papers, covering history, ethics and clinical medicine. His thought-provoking and erudite editorial pieces were crafted with literary flair. As I have recently come to appreciate, the role of editor involves considerable tenacity with regards to the independent peer-review process, a careful eye for detail and the skills of a diplomat. David is a busy clinician, and it could not have been easy to juggle an additional commitment as demanding as this one.</p><p>The success of the UMJ flows, in no small part, from the wisdom of its Editorial Board. My colleague, Professor Peter Maxwell, opens a series of Guest Editorials, below, with a discussion on the challenges facing clinical academics in the workforce. I hope that policy makers will give careful consideration to the solutions that he proposes.</p><p>A longstanding and steadfast supporter of this Journal, Professor John Hedley-Whyte, who is the David S. Sheridan Professor of Anaesthesia and Respiratory Therapy at Harvard University, has recently stepped down from the Editorial Board. His contribution as an author, particularly to the Medical History Section of this Journal, has been immense and continues in this Issue, on the subject of Hugh Percy, 10<sup>th</sup> Duke of Northumberland. Professor Hedley-Whyte&#8217;s colleagues on the Editorial Board have asked me to thank him for his many years of service and to wish him well for the future.</p><p>My satisfaction in seeing this Issue of the Journal take shape over the summer was considerably tempered by the news of Professor Barry Kelly&#8217;s death, in June. To describe Barry simply as a &#8216;former editor&#8217; of this Journal hardly does justice to his contribution. I am grateful, therefore, to Professor Patrick Morrison, who has penned a fitting and moving obituary to a great thinker, whose loss will be felt far beyond his family, friends and colleagues.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Clinical Academics in the NHS workforce &#8211; down but not out!</title><p>Peter Maxwell</p><p>The future for clinical academic doctors is dependent upon solving multiple challenges. These include providing clear training opportunities, sustainable career paths and a thriving environment for academic clinicians to conduct research, provide medical education and engage in clinical practice. Over the last 15 years, clinical academic numbers in the UK have fallen as a proportion of the NHS workforce.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This change reflects the sustained investment to expand the numbers of NHS consultants and general practitioners whereas, in contrast, there has been no substantial change in funding for clinical academic posts. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of clinical academics within the NHS medical workforce (now only 3%)<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. These demographic changes are reducing the visibility of clinical academics as role models in the overall NHS workforce and act as a deterrent to choosing a career in clinical academia. This situation is not unique to the UK with reported declines in clinical academic numbers in many countries.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Solutions are needed to help mentor doctors interested in research and teaching, to improve and expand clinical academic training opportunities and to provide more support (including job security) for individuals willing to make the sustained commitment to a clinical academic career.</p><p>Some of the challenges faced by clinical academics are obvious such as balancing the many competing demands of clinical duties and academic roles (research, teaching, supervision). Clinical academic training is typically much longer than &#8216;run through&#8217; NHS training and will usually involve time &#8216;out-of-programme&#8217;, to complete a PhD or MD degree, followed by further efforts to obtain funded post-doctoral research fellowship experience. This post PhD/ MD training will enhance an individual&#8217;s competitiveness for a tenured clinical academic post. Issues of pay disparity, funding uncertainties and lack of clear career paths for clinical academic trainees (compared to their full time NHS colleagues) are also disincentives.</p><p>For the future sustainability of the clinical academic workforce, it is important to have robust funding mechanisms that will support a much larger and more flexible training pipeline and additional funding to expand the number of early-and mid-career tenured clinical academic posts. This would help to promote diversity and increase the representation of women and underrepresented groups (which includes primary care researchers) in clinical academia. General practitioners typically have much shorter clinical training paths than hospital consultants therefore innovative routes are needed to provide GPs with clinical academic development opportunities after completing their training.</p><p>Clinical academics have critical roles in undertaking research aimed at improving human health. High profile medical scientific breakthroughs are often newsworthy and may lead to further inward investment into the life sciences sector with benefits to the wider UK economy.</p><p>Clinical academics are also well placed to contribute to the longer-term multidisciplinary research focused on reducing health inequalities, improving access to healthcare, developing disease prevention strategies and testing the utility of early detection methods (including cost effectiveness of screening programmes). This is valuable research contributing to the overall public health and it is ultimately also beneficial to the wider economy to have healthier working age and older age populations.</p><p>Despite the challenges, the current clinical academic workforce remains resilient and can respond rapidly to need e.g. during the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid establishment of the UK&#8217;s RECOVERY trial, led by clinical researchers, permitted prompt assessment of multiple therapeutic options.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>During their careers, clinical academics can look forward to embracing a broad portfolio of work and arguably have greater autonomy in what they choose to investigate (research) or how they educate (teaching). Local, national and international collaborations, with a wide range of investigators and educators, can lead to lifelong friendships that help sustain joy in working through the ups and downs of a busy clinical academic career.</p><p>The UK Office for the Strategic Co-ordination of Health Research recently commissioned a report entitled &#8220;Clinical researchers in the United Kingdom: Reversing the decline to improve population health and promote economic growth&#8221;.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This provides a comprehensive overview of difficulties facing clinical research allied to a number of important recommended actions including establishing a common national clinical research framework, ensuring the national training pathway is flexible and faster than currently, provision of visible leadership and mentorship by established researchers, and providing equitable rates of pay for clinical academics compared to NHS colleagues</p><p>The Irish Clinical Academic Training (ICAT) programme<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> was established in 2016 on an all-island basis and has been well-funded by multiple partners including the Health Research Board, Public Health Agency R&amp;D Division, postgraduate deaneries and all of the participating universities in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The ICAT programme has been hugely successful in providing opportunities for medical, dental and veterinary trainees to have structured research training pre-, during, and post-PhD with further encouragement for the trainees to have supervisors drawn from different institutions and wider disciplinary backgrounds. The alumni from the ICAT programme are now beginning to establish themselves in tenured clinical academic posts in Ireland and beyond. The ICAT programme has demonstrated that high quality clinical academic training is achievable with sustained investment, collaborative working and imaginative leadership from senior academics.</p><p>The Northern Ireland Clinical Academic Training Programme (CATP)<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> is a partnership between the Queen&#8217;s University Belfast (QUB), Ulster University (UU) and the Northern Ireland Medical &amp; Dental Training Agency (postgraduate deanery). The CATP provides dedicated time for academic training. The CATP scheme oversees recruitment into the Academic Foundation Programme with 4-month posts in Year 2, Academic Clinical Fellowship (ACF) posts (75% clinical /25% academic) and Academic Clinical Lecturer (ACL) posts (50% clinical /50% academic). The ACF posts are held prior to undertaking a postgraduate research degree (PhD/MD) and the ACL posts are for higher specialist trainees in medicine or dentistry who have a research degree. The CATP scheme has been successful in encouraging trainees to move up the clinical academic training ladder with CATP alumni obtaining tenured posts in Northern Ireland and beyond. However, the CATP scheme, as a training pipeline, is currently too small to sustain or expand the local clinical academic workforce.</p><p>Northern Ireland now has two medical schools (QUB &amp; UU) helping to educate the next generations of clinicians, researchers and medical educators. The total number of students enrolled in both medical schools is more than double the number of medical students in Northern Ireland 25 years ago. This increased enrolment is necessary for current and future NHS workforce plans.</p><p>In parallel, an urgent expansion in clinical academic training is required to meet the needs (for researchers and educators) within Northern Ireland&#8217;s dental and medical schools. It is also essential that many more clinical academic posts are created to help realise the exciting research opportunities and health economic benefits afforded by initiatives like iReach Health<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> (derived from the Belfast City Region Deal) and the new School of Medicine/Personalised Medicine Innovation Centre<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> (supported by the Derry/Londonderry &amp; Strabane City Region Deal).</p><p>Professor Peter Maxwell</p><p>Centre for Public Health, Queen&#8217;s University Belfast</p><p>
