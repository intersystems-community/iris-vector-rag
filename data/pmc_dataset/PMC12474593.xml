A recently developed and validated typology of diabetes-specific family functioning organizes these dimensions into four meaningful types (<italic toggle="yes">Collaborative &amp; Helpful</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Critically Involved</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Satisfied with Low Involvement,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Want More Involvement)</italic>. These types represent patterns of associations across dimensions of family involvement and synthesize these multiple dimensions of functioning into usable categories. The current study had two primary aims: first, to use qualitative data to enhance the quantitative understanding of types; and second, to describe qualitatively participants&#8217; own experiences with their family during a 9&#160;month family-focused intervention (and 6&#160;month follow-up) based on their diabetes-specific family functioning type at enrollment. Adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who participated in Family/Friend Activation to Motivate Self-care (FAMS), a family-focused self-care support intervention, were eligible. We recruited 77 participants across types to participate in semi-structured interviews at the completion of the follow-up. We found consistencies across types and differences between types. Regardless of type, harmful family involvement was described, but adults with T2D were hesitant to label it as such. Communication about diabetes and health increased during FAMS, but topics varied across types. Adults with T2D received more support from their families across time, though preference for emotional or instrumental support varied across types. This study qualitatively validated the typology tool paving the way for future use in intervention tailoring.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Type 2 diabetes</kwd><kwd>Family support</kwd><kwd>Self-management</kwd><kwd>Qualitative research</kwd><kwd>Precision medicine</kwd><kwd>Treatment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017618</institution-id><institution>Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolic Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK119282</award-id><award-id>R01DK119282-S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Mayberry</surname><given-names>Lindsay S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KL2TR002245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Roddy</surname><given-names>McKenzie K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Robust observational cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence indicates different dimensions of family functioning impact chronic disease self-management (Fort et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>; Rosland et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>). In adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D), specifically, dimensions of helpful family involvement, including autonomy support and emotional support, are associated with better outcomes while dimensions of harmful family involvement, including undermining, control, and criticism, are associated with worse outcomes (Rosland et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>). The effects of harmful involvement on self-care and glycemic management vary by the degree of co-existing helpful involvement (Mayberry &amp; Osborn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>). Furthermore, collaboration to address problems/challenges related to T2D can have differential effects depending on the perceptions and needs of the person with T2D. In other words, family functioning and its alignment with the desires of the person with T2D interact to affect outcomes.</p><p id="Par3">This complexity&#8211;identified in observational research&#8211;may contribute to heterogeneity in effects of family interventions among adults with T2D. Some reviews of family-focused interventions to improve self-management of T2D have found mixed or null results (Baig et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2015</xref>; Torenholt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>), whereas others have identified positive effects (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2022</xref>). One hypothesis for differential effects of family interventions is that persons with T2D experience interventions engaging family differently based on their family functioning prior to the intervention. For example, when family functioning is predominantly harmful and mismatched with the desires/needs of the person with T2D, an intervention seeking to increase family involvement may lead to null or iatrogenic effects on outcomes.</p><p id="Par4">Recently, a typology of diabetes-specific family functioning has been developed and validated which organizes nine dimensions of family functioning into four distinct types: <italic toggle="yes">Collaborative &amp; Helpful</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Critically Involved</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Satisfied with Low Involvement,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Want More Involvement</italic> (Mayberry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Collaborative &amp; Helpful</italic> (~&#8201;30%) is notable for high collaborative coping, helpful involvement, autonomy support, satisfaction, and helpfulness with low harmful involvement and perceived criticism; <italic toggle="yes">Critically Involved</italic> (~&#8201;15%) is notable for moderate levels of collaborative coping and autonomy support with very high levels of helpful and harmful involvement and perceived criticism, and moderate effectiveness but low satisfaction; <italic toggle="yes">Satisfied with Low Involvement</italic> (~&#8201;25%) is notable for very low or low scores in all dimensions with no marked dissatisfaction; and <italic toggle="yes">Want More Involvement</italic> (~&#8201;30%) is notable for moderate collaborative coping with low scores across other dimensions (like <italic toggle="yes">Satisfied with Low Involvement</italic>), distinguished by very low effectiveness and satisfaction (Mayberry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>). Type is independently associated cross-sectionally and longitudinally with diabetes distress, depressive symptoms, glycemic management, diabetes medication adherence, and diabetes self-efficacy (Mayberry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>). Observational studies find patterns of less to more optimal outcomes in this order: <italic toggle="yes">Critically Involved, Want More Involvement, Satisfied with Low Involvement, </italic> and <italic toggle="yes"> Collaborative &amp; Helpful</italic> (Mayberry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>). Notably, type is not a trait of an individual or a family but rather characterizes a state of family functioning around diabetes management at a specific point in time. Type is constructed of dynamic dimensions of family functioning; therefore, type is likewise dynamic. In the absence of an intervention,&#8201;~&#8201;50% change type over 3&#8211;6&#160;months (Mayberry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>). Similar to other &#8220;states&#8221; such as motivation or self-efficacy to quit smoking, family functioning type may predict intervention engagement and outcomes. This suggests potential for interventions to change family functioning type and for an intervention to be received differently based on family functioning type at intervention initiation.</p><p id="Par5">The recently validated typology creates a new opportunity to investigate participants&#8217; experiences with a family intervention by baseline family functioning type. The Family/Friend Activation to Motivate Self-care (FAMS) intervention targets self-care, self-efficacy, and family involvement (increasing helpful involvement and reducing harmful involvement). FAMS consists of monthly coaching calls to set self-care goals (e.g., increase exercise, improve diet, manage stress) and build skills to manage family involvement (e.g., problem solving, assertive communication) as well as text messages encouraging self-care and monitoring medication adherence and self-care goal completion. Participants have the option to invite a friend or family member to co-participate as a support person who also receives texts about their self-care goals. The recently completed FAMS 2.0 randomized controlled trial (RCT; 2.0 indicates updates and improvements to the FAMS intervention since the pilot RCT; Mayberry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>) evaluated FAMS versus enhanced treatment as usual on glycemic management, diabetes distress, global well-being, diabetes self-care, diabetes self-efficacy, and family involvement (Mayberry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2022</xref>). Compared to control, on average FAMS improved diabetes distress, global well-being, diabetes self-efficacy, helpful family involvement, and dietary behavior; there was not an average effect on glycemic management (Nelson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2023</xref>; Roddy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2023</xref>). Moderation analyses revealed differences in engagement with and outcomes of the intervention by type in the FAMS 2.0 RCT. Specifically, <italic toggle="yes">Want More Involvement </italic>benefited the most; <italic toggle="yes">Satisfied with Low Involvement</italic> had early improvements that waned; <italic toggle="yes">Collaborative &amp; Helpful</italic> were highly engaged but derived minimal benefits from the intervention; and <italic toggle="yes">Critically Involved</italic> benefitted the least and may have experienced some harm (Roddy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2025</xref>). The RCT was preregistered (ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04347291">NCT04347291</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par6">We applied the typology within the FAMS 2.0 RCT to assess type and interviewed participants assigned to FAMS about their experiences to address two aims. As designed, FAMS targets key dimensions of the typology with a goal of increasing helpful involvement and collaboration. All our typology work to date has been quantitative, and we sought to strengthen understanding of the typology with qualitative data representing individuals&#8217; perspectives on their experiences with their family. Additionally, we were interested in qualitatively describing participants&#8217; experiences with family during the intervention based on their diabetes-specific family functioning type at enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par7">We conducted semi-structured interviews with adults with T2D who participated in the FAMS 2.0 RCT and were assigned to the intervention group. As part of the RCT, participants completed assessments, including the typology assessment, at baseline, 6&#160;months (mid intervention), 9&#160;months (post intervention), and 15&#160;months (follow-up). As participants finished their RCT experience, we recruited them purposefully via phone by type assigned at baseline to ensure 15&#8211;20 interviews reflecting each type. We also selectively recruited participants for interviews to ensure interviewed participants reflected the clinical and demographic characteristics of the type in the RCT sample. Trained interviewers (male research assistant with limited experience [SM] and female postdoctoral fellow with more experience [MKR]) conducted semi-structured interviews with participants after the RCT 15&#160;-month follow-up, which was approximately 6&#160;months after their completion of the 9-&#160;month FAMS intervention. Interviewers had limited relationships with participants (assisted in retention efforts for RCT), and participants&#8217; knowledge of the research came from the informed consent. Informed consent was collected verbally; interviews were conducted over the telephone and lasted approximately 30&#8211;45&#160;min. Questions explored participants&#8217; experience with family and friend involvement in their diabetes before, during, and since their FAMS experience, and participants&#8217; experience with FAMS overall and with individual intervention components (e.g., text messages, monthly coaching, invitation to invite a support person to participate in FAMS; see Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

No repeat interviews were conducted, and transcripts were not returned to participants. First, interviews were structurally coded based on the main sections of the interview guide (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). During the structural coding processes, coders reviewed the entire interview transcript for all interviews and allocated data by topic discussed in the interview. After structural coding, we reviewed the data within each structural code and agreed the Family Interactions Regarding Diabetes code contained content with the most generalizable information and most relevant for our questions about experiences by type, rather than information specific to FAMS. If a participant spoke about family interactions outside of the interview questions designated in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, that content was included during the structural coding process. Content in other structural codes was focused largely on feedback about the specific intervention and RCT procedures. Therefore, we decided to focus on data about Family Interactions Regarding Diabetes for thematic analysis. Next, a team of three raters [EB, SM, CG] distributed and reviewed the data coded to Family Interactions Regarding Diabetes, and independently generated notes about emergent themes. The raters then met and discussed their notes to develop an initial thematic codebook for the data pertaining to Family Interactions Regarding Diabetes (Braun &amp; Clarke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2006</xref>). This coding scheme was refined by study authors who had participated in the structural coding and were familiar with the interviews. Then, the final coding scheme was applied iteratively to first three (&#954;&#8201;=&#8201;90) and then later five (&#954;&#8201;=&#8201;80) transcripts to establish and confirm inter-rater reliability across 10% of the transcripts. All types were represented across 10% of the transcripts used to evaluate inter-rater reliability. During this process, updates to the codebook were made as needed. Raters then independently thematically coded the rest of the data relevant to Family Interactions Regarding Diabetes, meeting regularly to discuss any questions or resolve any uncertainties.</p><p id="Par10">Next, [MKR &amp; EB] conducted constant comparison analyses by diabetes-specific family functioning types on thematic codes appearing within the topic of Family Interactions Regarding Diabetes (Strauss &amp; Corbin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1990</xref>). Constant comparison procedures compare all data relevant to a particular thematic code with other occurrences of the same thematic code within and across groups (in this case, diabetes-specific family functioning type) to uncover similarities and differences in prevalence as an indicator of salience and dimensions within the themes. We reviewed participants&#8217; narratives about their family and friends&#8217; involvement in their diabetes to identify similarities and differences in thematic codes across and between participants by type. The results presented are based on these constant comparative analyses, whereby similarities and differences in the prevalence and dimensions of the thematic codes by type are summarized.</p><p id="Par11">To enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of our results, we used investigator triangulation (multiple authors were involved in the reading and interpreting of codes and themes) and audit trails (a thorough accounting of each step of the process we undertook) during the coding process.

Participants&#8217; descriptions of their family experiences reflected the characteristics of the type assigned with the quantitative survey typology assessment tool, lending face validity to the typology. We found consistent themes across types and differences between types in their experiences with family during the intervention. Across types, harmful involvement was present and adults with T2D were hesitant to label it as such. Communication about diabetes and health increased during FAMS, and adults with T2D received more emotional and instrumental support from their families.</p><p id="Par27">Areas of difference across types within the themes are of particular note. Within the first theme of Presence of Harmful Involvement, there were few differences across types; however, <italic toggle="yes">Critically Involved</italic> more readily mentioned harmful involvement when asked than other types. Additionally, <italic toggle="yes">Satisfied with Low Involvement</italic> were less ready to excuse or explain away harmful behaviors than <italic toggle="yes">Collaborative &amp; Helpful</italic>. In the theme of Increases in Communication<italic toggle="yes">, </italic><italic toggle="yes">Critically Involved</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Collaborative &amp; Helpful</italic> described how it was easier to talk about diabetes with friends and family; however, only <italic toggle="yes">Collaborative &amp; Helpful</italic> used these conversations to ask for specific support. <italic toggle="yes">Satisfied with Low Involvement</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Want More Involvement</italic> both described sharing things about their diabetes with their friends and family they previously had not shared. Regarding Received Helpful Involvement, emotional support was more pronounced for <italic toggle="yes">Satisfied with Low Involvement</italic> while instrumental support was more pronounced for <italic toggle="yes">Critically Involved.</italic> Both <italic toggle="yes">Collaborative &amp; Helpful</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Want More Involvement</italic> endorsed emotional and instrumental support, and <italic toggle="yes">Want More Involvement</italic> was the only type to emphasize the importance of reminders from family and friends.</p><p id="Par28">This is the first application of the typology to understand experiences with an intervention qualitatively and it sheds light on areas for future research, particularly regarding intervention tailoring for each type. Results indicate different types may have different intervention needs. <italic toggle="yes">Collaborative &amp; Helpful</italic> really enjoyed the intervention&#8217;s focus on involving family. Family was highly involved in helpful and autonomy supportive ways for <italic toggle="yes">Collaborative &amp; Helpful</italic>. In FAMS, most of the intervention focused on the adult with T2D. Family and friends received text messages but were not involved in coaching calls or goal setting. Due to the positive and collaborative relationship with family that is typical of <italic toggle="yes">Collaborative &amp; Helpful</italic>, a dyadic intervention more fully involving family may be welcomed and appropriate.</p><p id="Par29">We expected FAMS&#8217;s focus on relational aspects such as assertive communication training to decrease criticism and be a good fit for <italic toggle="yes">Critically Involved.</italic> Unfortunately, <italic toggle="yes">Critically Involved</italic> reported persistent issues with harmful involvement and their descriptions of family included controlling aspects. It&#8217;s possible that interventions that seek to engage family&#8211;even when addressing harmful aspects&#8211;may not be a good fit on average for <italic toggle="yes">Critically Involved</italic>. Rather interventions that do not engage family in self-management or interventions that train family members directly on communication may be more successful.</p><p id="Par30">We were surprised by how much <italic toggle="yes">Satisfied with Low Involvement</italic> liked FAMS, and so were they. Data demonstrated more positive experiences with the intervention than negative; however, there were some adults with this type who maintained their individual approach versus a family approach to the management of their disease despite participation in FAMS. <italic toggle="yes">Satisfied with Low Involvement</italic> were more focused on emotional than instrumental support. Disease-focused actions may have felt intrusive or like they were being &#8216;treated as children,&#8217; as has been described elsewhere (Mayberry &amp; Osborn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>). Instead, <italic toggle="yes">Satisfied with Low Involvement</italic> comments oriented towards increasing emotional support.</p><p id="Par31">Finally, there was good fit between FAMS and <italic toggle="yes">Want More Involvement.</italic> This type described how FAMS helped their families change their behaviors in order to meet their needs. Interestingly, family providing reminders for self-care was frequently described as a positive by <italic toggle="yes">Want More Involvement</italic>, and it is unclear why reminders were so salient for this group. It is possible that due to the higher cognitive compensation needs typical of this group (Mayberry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>) that reminders provided a strong match between their desired and received involvement. Alternatively, <italic toggle="yes">Want More Involvement</italic> is also characterized by lower helpful involvement (Mayberry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>), and family beginning to be involved at all, by providing reminders, is a welcome change.</p><p id="Par32">Qualitative findings provide nuance to quantitative findings on the typology. For instance, both <italic toggle="yes">Want More Involvement</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Satisfied with Low Involvement</italic> are characterized by low helpful involvement (Mayberry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>), but here we learned the former thrived with increased instrumental support while the later preferred emotional support. Future interventions could investigate deepening family involvement over time for <italic toggle="yes">Want More Involvement</italic>&#8211;starting with providing reminders and building to doing the behavior or activity together. Harmful aspects of family involvement, assessed quantitatively, are often experienced by adults with T2D (Mayberry &amp; Osborn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>). However, interviewed participants were hesitant to describe any behavior as &#8220;harmful&#8221;, even with direct questioning, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about how the intervention may have impacted harmful aspects. Although there were similarities in harmful involvement experienced across types, there may have been differences in how types responded to harmful involvement as well. Specifically, <italic toggle="yes">Critically Involved, Satisfied with Low Involvement,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Want More Involvement</italic> all discussed feeling judged or guilty for their choices, possibly internalizing the harmful comments. On the other hand, while <italic toggle="yes">Satisfied with Low</italic> felt frustrated with their families who continued to bring unhelpful foods into the home, <italic toggle="yes">Collaborative &amp; Helpful</italic> gave family the benefit of the doubt in similar situations. Future research could explore how existing family dynamics influence responses to harmful behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p id="Par33">Participants experienced a family-focused mobile delivered intervention which likely biased some of their responses compared to a sample who had not. There may be less variability in responses across types because they were all exposed to FAMS. Thus, the type differences in comments about family are especially striking. Participants were retrospectively reporting on experiences from 6&#8211;15&#160;months prior to the interviews (covering experiences before, during and after their 9&#160;month intervention experience) which may have hampered recall. However, the rich descriptions and examples provided in the interviews suggest the experiences were meaningful and salient. We grouped participants based on their baseline type for analyses, knowing that type changes over time (Mayberry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>). Had we conducted interviews at baseline or over the course of the intervention, we may have found different themes. Similarly, there may be type differences in sections of the interview not coded here.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par34">Qualitative data fills in the gaps of quantitative data to create a fuller picture by including participants&#8217; perspectives and elucidating differences and nuances not evident in quantitative data. Here, we added qualitative validity to a typology that had previously been quantitatively validated (Mayberry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023</xref>). Our findings provide support for the idea that family interventions for diabetes management should not be a &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; approach given the diversity in family functioning and discrepancies between individuals&#8217; desired and received involvement. Opportunities exist to use this typology to begin to match proffered interventions to individual needs, which will ultimately make interventions more effective.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Samuel Molli and Charmin Guy for their contributions as interviewer and coder, respectively, to this project.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the study conception.
