Based on the research of the vertical sealing evolution forms of oil source faults and their distribution locations, the study is conducted from two aspects. One is to determine the vertical sealed and unsealed positions of oil source faults during the oil and gas accumulation period according to the ancient fault juxtaposition thickness of the regional mudstone caprock and the maximum such thickness for fault connection. The other is to clarify the current vertical sealed and unsealed positions of oil source faults by analyzing the mixed displacement pressure of fault rocks and the current displacement pressure of underlying reservoir rocks. By integrating these two aspects, a prediction method is established. Applied to the Dazhangtuo Fault in Qikou Sag of Bohai Bay Basin, it reveals 4 forms of vertical sealing evolution. The sealed-sealed form distributes in the west, center and east; the sealed-unsealed form is in one west location; the unsealed-sealed form is in two east locations; the unsealed-unsealed form is in one location. The distribution of sealed-sealed and unsealed-sealed forms is beneficial for oil and gas accumulation, proving the method&#8217;s feasibility and providing a new perspective for related studies.But this method can only be used in basins or sags with a large number of measured displacement pressures of surrounding rocks.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Oil source faults</kwd><kwd>Vertical sealing</kwd><kwd>Evolution form</kwd><kwd>Distribution position</kwd><kwd>Prediction method</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Geology</kwd><kwd>Tectonics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Research status</title><p id="Par2">With the deepening of oil and gas exploration, it is gradually discovered that not all parts under the regional mudstone caprock near the oil source faults have oil and gas accumulation and distribution, which is mainly controlled by the distribution of vertical sealing evolution form of oil source faults in addition to the influence whether the trap is developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Oil and gas can be accumulated and preserved only when it is located in the distribution position of the vertical sealing evolution form of the oil source faults that is conducive to the accumulation and preservation of oil and gas. Otherwise, there is no oil and gas accumulation and preservation. The key to oil and gas exploration under regional mudstone caprock at oil source faults is to accurately predict the distribution of vertical sealing evolution forms of oil source faults.</p><p id="Par3">At present, there is no literature guidance on the distribution of vertical sealing evolution form of oil source faults, but corresponding research has been carried out, which can be summarized in the following two aspects: &#9312; The determination of vertical sealing of current oil source faults is mainly based on the assumption that the oil source faults are rock strata inclined into surrounding rock, and the displacement pressure of fault rock is the same as that of surrounding rock, which is mainly affected by its burial depth of compaction and shale content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The displacement pressure of fault rock is calculated by calculating the burial depth of compaction and shale content of fault rock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and using the empirical relationship among the measured displacement pressure of surrounding rock and the burial depth of compaction and shale content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Then use the burial depth of compaction and shale content of the underlying reservoir rock to calculate the displacement pressure of the reservoir rock based on the relationship among the measured displacement pressure of the reservoir rock and the burial depth of compaction and shale content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Finally, the relative magnitude of displacement pressure of fault rock and reservoir rock is compared to study the vertical sealing of current oil source faults. If the displacement pressure of fault rock is greater than or equal to that of underlying reservoir rock, the oil source faults is vertically sealed. On the contrary, it is unsealed. &#9313; The determination of the vertical sealing of the oil source faults in the oil and gas accumulation period is mainly based on the relative size of the regional mudstone caprock caprock-fault juxtaposition thickness (the regional mudstone caprock thickness minus the fault displacement of the oil source faults) and the maximum caprock-fault juxtaposition thickness required for the segmented growth of the fault in the regional mudstone caprock to connect up and down. If the caprock-fault juxtaposition thickness of regional mudstone caprock is greater than or equal to the maximum caprock-fault juxtaposition thickness required for the segmented growth of the fault in the regional mudstone caprock to connect up and down, the oil source faults are vertically sealed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. On the contrary, it is unsealed. These research results play a very important role in correctly understanding the distribution of oil and gas under the regional mudstone caprock at the oil source faults.</p><p id="Par4">However, these studies were conducted separately on the vertical sealing of oil source faults at present and during the oil and gas accumulation period, and were also conducted on different oil source faults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Lacking of the study on the sealing position of the vertical sealing evolution form of oil source faults, was not conducive to the in-depth exploration of oil and gas under the regional mudstone caprock at the oil source faults. Therefore, it is of great significance to carry out the research on the prediction method of the distribution of vertical sealing evolution form of oil source faults for correctly understanding the distribution rule of oil and gas under the regional mudstone caprock in the oil source faults of oil and gas bearing basins and guiding their oil and gas exploration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Evolution form and distribution position of vertical sealing of oil source faults</title><p id="Par5">Due to the different activity characteristics of the oil source faults itself and the development characteristics of the regional mudstone caprocks staggered by it, the vertical sealing distribution characteristics of the oil and gas accumulation period and the current oil source faults are different, resulting in the different vertical sealing evolution forms of the oil source faults. The following four forms can be summarized: the first is the vertical sealed - sealed evolution form of the oil source faults, this evolution form means that both the oil and gas accumulation period and the current oil source faults are vertically sealed, and the overlapping position of the two is the distribution position of the vertical sealed - sealed evolution form of oil source faults, which is conducive to the accumulation and preservation of oil and gas under the regional mudstone caprock at the oil source faults, as shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. The second is the vertical sealed - unsealed evolution form of oil source faults. This evolution form refers to the vertical sealing of oil source faults during the oil and gas accumulation period, but is unsealed at present. The overlapping position of the two is the distribution position of the vertical sealing evolution form of oil source faults, which is not conducive to the accumulation and preservation of oil and gas under the regional mudstone caprock at the oil source faults, as shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. The third is the vertical unsealed - sealed evolution form of oil source faults. This evolution form refers to the vertical unsealed oil source faults during the oil and gas accumulation period, but the current oil source faults are vertically sealed. The overlapping part of the two is the distribution part of the vertical sealing evolution form of oil source faults. Generally, it is not conducive to the accumulation and preservation of oil and gas under the regional mudstone caprock at the oil source faults, but it is conducive to the accumulation and preservation of oil and gas under specific geological conditions, as shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c. The fourth is the vertical unsealed - unsealed evolution form of oil source faults. This evolution form refers to that both the oil and gas accumulation period and the current oil source faults are unsealed vertically. The overlapping position of the two is the vertical unsealed - unsealed evolution form distribution position of oil source faults, which is not conducive to the accumulation and preservation of oil and gas under the regional mudstone caprock at the oil source faults, as shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d.</p><p id="Par6">

</p><p id="Par23">To determine the vertical sealed and unsealed positions of the current oil source faults, it is necessary to determine the current displacement pressure of the fault rock in the regional mudstone caprock and that of the underlying reservoir rock of the oil source faults. Use drilling and 3D seismic data to calculate the current fault displacement of the oil source faults in the regional mudstone caprock and the current thickness and shale content of the faulted strata. Calculate the shale content of the fault rock of the oil source faults in the regional mudstone caprock according to Eq.&#160;(<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>). The drilling and 3D seismic data are used to calculate the current burial depth, dip angle, inactive time of the oil source faults in the regional mudstone caprock, and the compaction and diagenesis time of the surrounding rock with the same burial depth, which are substituted into Eq.&#160;(<xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>) to calculate the compaction and diagenesis burial depth of the fault rock. Substitute the shale content and compacted burial depth of fault rock of oil source faults in the regional mudstone caprock into the empirical relationship among the measured displacement pressure of surrounding rock in the study area and its compacted burial depth and shale content (Eq.&#160;<xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>), and then the current displacement pressure of fault rock of oil source faults in the regional mudstone caprock can be obtained, as shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="d33e730">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The analysis on the relationship between the prediction results and the current oil and gas distribution under the regional mudstone caprock of the middle sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub> at the Dazhangtuo fault, proves the feasibility in predicting the distribution of vertical sealing evolution form of oil source faults.</p><p id="Par34">The Dazhangtuo fault is a NE trending normal fault about 21.3&#160;km long in the north of Qikou sag. The dip angle of the fault plane is 55&#176;&#8211;62&#176; and it dips to the southeast from the lower basement up to near the surface, showing the characteristics of long-term inheritance, as shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The strata developed in the northern part of Qikou sag where the Dazhangtuo fault is located are Paleogene, Neogene and a small amount of Quaternary from the bottom to the top. The Paleogene includes Kongdian Formation, Shahejie Formation and Dongying Formation, and the Neogene includes Guantao Formation and Minghuazhen Formation. At present, the oil and gas discovered at the Dazhangtuo fault are mainly distributed in the lower sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub>. The oil and gas mainly come from the underlying source rock of Es<sub>3</sub>, and the caprock is a large set of regional mudstone developed in the middle sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub>. The Dazhangtuo fault connects the source rock of underlying Es<sub>3</sub> and the reservoir of the lower sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub>, and it should be the oil source faults of the lower sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub> during the oil and gas accumulation period - the middle and late period of Minghuazhen Formation sedimentation. It can be seen from Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> that the discovered oil and gas in the lower sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub> of Dazhangtuo Fault are mainly distributed in the east and a small amount in the west. This is mainly affected by the distribution of vertical sealing evolution form of Dazhangtuo Fault in the regional mudstone caprock of the middle sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub>, in addition to the influence of the development of traps and sand bodies. Therefore, it is very important for oil and gas exploration to accurately predict the distribution position of vertical sealing evolution form of Dazhangtuo fault in the regional mudstone caprock of the middle sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="Par35">

However, in the lower sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub> where the Dazhangtuo fault is vertically unsealed&#8212;sealed evolution form, although the Dazhangtuo fault was vertically unsealed in the regional mudstone caprock of the lower sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub> during the oil and gas accumulation period, which was not conducive to the oil and gas generated from the source rock of Es<sub>3</sub> along the Dazhangtuo fault into the lower sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub> for accumulation and preservation, the Dazhangtuo fault disappeared upward in the regional mudstone caprock of Minghuazhen Formation overlying, and its top was sealed, resulting in the inability of oil and gas to migrate upward along the Dazhangtuo fault, and oil and gas can only be obtained by oil and gas exploration when they are accumulated and preserved in the lower sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub> under the regional mudstone caprock of the middle sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="Par52">

</p><p id="Par53">This method is applied to a case study of the evolution forms of vertical sealing of the Dazhangtuo Fault in the middle sub - member of Es<sub>1</sub> within the regional mudstone caprock in the Qikou Sag of the Bohai Bay Basin. The results show a good correspondence with the oil and gas discovered in the lower sub - member of Es<sub>1</sub> at the Dazhangtuo Fault at present, which verifies the feasibility of this method for studying the distribution of the evolution forms of vertical sealing of oil source faults. However, there are still two problems with this method:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par54">This method is mainly applicable to predicting the distribution of the evolution forms of vertical sealing of extensional normal oil source faults in sand&#8212;shale petroliferous basins. It is not applicable to predicting the distribution of the evolution forms of vertical sealing of compressional and strike - slip oil source faults in the strata of sand - shale petroliferous basins, and is even less applicable to predicting the distribution of the evolution forms of vertical sealing of oil source faults in volcanic or carbonate rock strata.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par55">When using this method to study the distribution of the evolution forms of vertical sealing of oil source faults, it is necessary to determine the displacement pressures of fault rocks and reservoir rocks. Therefore, this method can only be used in basins or sags with a large number of measured displacement pressures of surrounding rocks. Otherwise, it is difficult to apply this method.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par56">
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The vertical sealing evolution of oil source faults mainly includes vertical sealed&#8212;sealed, vertical sealed - unsealed, vertical unsealed - sealed and vertical unsealed&#8212;unsealed evolution form.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par57">By comparing the ancient caprock-fault juxtaposition thickness of regional mudstone caprock and the maximum such thickness for fault vertical growth, the vertical sealed-unsealed positions of oil source faults during hydrocarbon accumulation are determined. Based on the current displacement pressures of fault and underlying reservoir rocks, the current vertical sealed-unsealed positions of oil source faults are found. Combining these two, a method for predicting the distribution of vertical sealing evolution forms of oil source faults is established. Example applications prove its feasibility.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par58">In the middle sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub> in Dazhangtuo fault, Qikou sag, Bohai Bay basin, there are four vertical sealing evolution forms in regional mudstone caprock. Sealed-sealed forms are mainly in the west, middle and east; sealed-unsealed form is only in one west location; unsealed-sealed forms are mainly in two east locations; unsealed-unsealed form is in one location. The distribution of sealed-sealed and unsealed-sealed forms benefits hydrocarbon accumulation and preservation from Es<sub>3</sub> source rock in the lower sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub> at Dazhangtuo fault, consistent with the current hydrocarbon distribution in the lower sub-member of Es<sub>1</sub>.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par59">This method is mainly applicable to the prediction of the distribution of vertical sealing evolution patterns of oil-source faults in sandstone petroliferous basins. In the future, attempts can be made to extend it to other types of petroliferous basins, such as carbonate formations. By studying the characteristics and main controlling factors of fault sealing in different formation types, the method can be improved and refined.</p></list-item></list>
