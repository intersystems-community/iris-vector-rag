While previous studies have proposed increased mind wandering at nonpreferred times of the day, these findings come from methodologically limited designs. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we revisited this hypothesis and examined how mind wandering is associated with time of day and chronotype, hypothesizing that mind wandering would be more likely to occur during nonpreferred times of the day. Additionally, we took an exploratory approach and investigated previously unexplored daily fluctuations in temporal orientations of mind wandering in different chronotypes. A total of 152 participants were involved in an EMA, rendering a total of 13&#8201;001 successfully completed samples. Generalized linear and linear mixed models were employed to investigate the associations between chronotype, time of day, mind wandering, and its temporal orientations. A pronounced time-of-day dynamic was observed, pointing to a gradually decreasing probability of mind wandering over the course of the day; however, no chronotype synchrony effect was observed. Daily dynamics of the temporal orientation of mind wandering were significantly predicted by chronotype. While eveningness was associated with an increase in the proportion of future-oriented thoughts and a decrease in that of present-oriented thoughts throughout the day, the opposite was found for morningness. These findings suggest that time of day is associated with the probability of mind wandering and its temporal orientation, the latter moderated by an individual&#8217;s chronotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mind wandering</kwd><kwd>temporal orientation</kwd><kwd>experience sampling</kwd><kwd>chronotype</kwd><kwd>daily fluctuations</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythms</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Janos Bolyai scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NKFI FK 142945</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec3"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although humans are continuously encompassed by the physical environment, our cognition during waking life often disengages from immediate surroundings and ongoing activities, and is instead flooded with internally generated contents commonly known as mind wandering (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Smallwood and Schooler 2015</xref>). Mind wandering is frequently investigated by thought probes intermittently presented during cognitive tasks performed in laboratory settings (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Smallwood and Schooler 2015</xref>). Although laboratory studies allow for the well-controlled assessment of mind wandering during specific cognitive tasks, there has been a surge in ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies recently (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Kawashima et&#160;al. 2023</xref>). In these studies, thought probes are periodically sent to participants throughout the day via mobile phones or similar devices (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Shiffman et&#160;al. 2008</xref>), enabling researchers to investigate the experience of mind wandering in daily life. Compared to lab-based or retrospective approaches, EMA offers substantially greater ecological validity and temporal precision in capturing mind wandering dynamics. Importantly, both laboratory-based and EMA studies generally converge on the observation that mind wandering occurs in 30%&#8211;50% of our waking time (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Killingsworth and Gilbert 2010</xref>, <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Poerio et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Stawarczyk et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Kane et&#160;al. 2017</xref>). However, these studies are typically conducted either in a single session (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Smallwood et&#160;al. 2009</xref>, <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Stawarczyk et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Plimpton et&#160;al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Seli et&#160;al. 2017</xref>, <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Shrimpton et&#160;al. 2017</xref>) or they merge daily life experiential data within each participant (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Killingsworth and Gilbert 2010</xref>, <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Song and Wang 2012</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Franklin et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Poerio et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Spronken et&#160;al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Kane et&#160;al. 2017</xref>), which overlooks the potential effects of time of day on how likely mind wandering is to occur.</p><p>Various theoretical accounts of mind wandering suggest an association with attention and executive functioning (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Smallwood and Schooler 2006</xref>, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">McVay and Kane 2009</xref>), both of which exhibit pronounced time-of-day fluctuations (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et&#160;al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Valdez et&#160;al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Valdez 2019</xref>) linked to chronotype (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">May and Hasher 1998</xref>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et&#160;al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Hahn et&#160;al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Lara et&#160;al. 2014</xref>). Accordingly, it has been speculated that mind wandering might also exhibit similar circadian modulations (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Giambra et&#160;al. 1989</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Carciofo et&#160;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#160;al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Van Opstal et&#160;al. 2022</xref>). Understanding when and in what form mind wandering occurs across the day and how chronotype moderates the association is important. Both its frequency and temporal orientation may signal daily periods of increased risk for task disengagement, as well as opportunities for beneficial spontaneous thinking, like future-oriented mind wandering (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Baird et&#160;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Stawarczyk et&#160;al. 2011</xref>). Understanding the influence of chronotype and time of day on mind wandering may therefore be highly relevant in work and educational settings.</p><p>Circadian rhythms, endogenously regulated and exogenously entrained near-24-h oscillations, underlie the sleep&#8211;wake cycle and govern the dynamics of numerous physiological processes such as core body temperature regulation and hormone secretion, as well as various aspects of cognitive performance (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et&#160;al. 2007</xref>). Despite extensive literature covering the time-of-day effect on attention and executive functioning, daytime fluctuations of mind wandering have largely been ignored thus far. <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Giambra et&#160;al. (1989)</xref> suggested that the frequency of mind wandering roughly follows fluctuations in core body temperature, peaking around midday to early afternoon. In a more recent study by <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#160;al. (2018)</xref>, mind wandering (conceptualized as task-unrelated thoughts [TUTs]) exhibited a gradual increase throughout the day, peaking in the evening hours. Results of these studies suggest that the highest frequencies and rates of mind wandering roughly coincide with the supposed peaks in alertness and propensity to stay awake (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et&#160;al. 2007</xref>) and align with times when better performance at a variety of cognitive tasks has been observed (<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Valdez et&#160;al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Valdez 2019</xref>). However, these studies did not control for possible chronotype-related differences in the daily dynamics of mind wandering.</p><p>Considering chronotype, individuals are commonly categorized into (extreme) morning, (extreme) evening, and intermediate types, reflecting individual differences and preferences for the timing of the sleep&#8211;wake cycle, eating habits, and physical as well as mental activity (<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Zou et&#160;al. 2022</xref>). As for daily fluctuations in cognitive functioning, the so-called &#8220;synchrony effect&#8221; describing that individuals perform better at their preferred times of the day (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Nowack and Van Der Meer 2018</xref>), has been observed in numerous executive functions including cognitive flexibility and planning (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et&#160;al. 2008</xref>), or tasks involving inhibitory control (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">May and Hasher 1998</xref>, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Lara et&#160;al. 2014</xref>). With regard to mind wandering, studies propose a similar, albeit inverted synchrony effect, as participants reported that mind wandering was more likely to occur during nonpreferred times of the day for respective chronotype (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Carciofo et&#160;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Van Opstal et&#160;al. 2022</xref>). However, studies examining the associations between chronotypes and mind wandering are scarce and methodologically limited, relying on retrospective questionnaires (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Carciofo et&#160;al. 2014</xref>) or thought probes administered during specific, attention-demanding tasks (<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Van Opstal et&#160;al. 2022</xref>). As a result, how mind wandering varies throughout the day during everyday activities across different chronotypes remains largely unexplored.</p><p>The first aim of our study was to revisit the established mind wandering synchrony effect hypothesis (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Carciofo et&#160;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Van Opstal et&#160;al. 2022</xref>) using EMA. We investigated whether mind wandering probability in everyday life exhibits a synchrony effect in different chronotypes, hypothesizing that mind wandering would be more likely to occur during nonpreferred times of day. Our methodological approach offers finer temporal resolution than more controlled or retrospective methods and, by aligning sampling windows with individual sleep&#8211;wake schedules, more accurately captures chronotype-related differences in natural daily cognitive dynamics.</p><p>The second aim of the study was to explore potential daily fluctuations in the temporal orientation of mind wandering, namely future-, present-, and past-oriented thoughts, and whether chronotype moderates these patterns. A better understanding of these dynamics could reveal whether mind wandering during certain periods serves adaptive and anticipatory functions, given its links to planning, prospective memory, social cognition, and emotion regulation (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Baird et&#160;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Ruby et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Girardeau et&#160;al. 2023</xref>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Kam et&#160;al. 2024</xref>). As no previous studies have examined temporal orientation across the day, we did not propose specific hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited via student pools at E&#246;tv&#246;s Lor&#225;nd University, Hungary.

There they installed the application m-Path (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Mestdagh et&#160;al. 2023</xref>), created their anonymized profile, and detailed instructions about the study were provided. Participants were instructed to avoid responding if it would potentially harm their safety and well-being (e.g. responding while driving). Participants also provided their preferred wake-up and bedtimes, which served as daily starting and ending sample time points of the upcoming 10-day EMA period.</p><p>Based on a recent review (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Kawashima et&#160;al. 2023</xref>), we chose a 10-day EMA period (including weekends) with 10 daily samples and set a 50% compliance threshold. A 15-min maximum latency was used to reduce recall bias (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">De Vries et&#160;al. 2021</xref>). Participants completed the same questionnaire repeatedly over 10 days. Each day&#8217;s 15-h period, from provided wake-up to provided bedtime, was divided into ten 1.5-h blocks. The m-Path scheduling randomly assigned one sample within each block, using different randomization seeds per participant to ensure unique sampling times. Each sample was signaled by an m-Path notification, and reminders were sent twice (after 2 and 5&#160;min) if the participant did not respond to the sample immediately. If the participant did not respond to the sample within the designated 15-min window, access to the questionnaire was removed until the following sample. During the whole EMA period, no feedback was disclosed to participants, but they received customized reward messages when they completed 50%, 65%, 75% and 85% of the samples.

It assesses individual preferences on the morningness-eveningness spectrum, with lower cumulative scores indicating eveningness (minimum is 10) and higher scores indicating morningness (maximum is 59). The items focus on the individual&#8217;s ideal sleep&#8211;wake schedules and preferred time for various mentally or physically demanding activities. The 13-item Hungarian version of the MEQ showed good internal consistency in the present dataset (Cronbach&#8217;s <italic toggle="yes">&#945;</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.85). In our primary analyses, we treated MEQ-H scores as a continuous variable. For additional exploratory within-group analyses and visualizations, participants were also categorized into three chronotype groups. Unlike the original MEQ, which includes predefined cut-off scores for chronotype groupings, the MEQ-H does not have validated population-based thresholds for group assignment. Validation studies suggest that the MEQ-H can either be used as a continuous measure, or the sample of adequate size can be split into morning/intermediate/evening groups based on the first and the last quartile of the MEQ-H scores, respectively, with lowest 25% of scores belonging to evening group, highest 25% belonging to morning group and the middle 50% to intermediate group (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Simor et&#160;al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Zavecz et&#160;al. 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>EMA questionnaire</title><p>Our mind wandering EMA questionnaire was based on studies investigating similar phenomenological dimensions of mind wandering (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Ruby et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Plimpton et&#160;al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Spronken et&#160;al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Marcusson-Clavertz et&#160;al. 2022</xref>, <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). In the first sample of each day, participants provided accurate information about their wake-up time on that specific day and bedtime on the night before. The first mind wandering item of the questionnaire asked participants whether they were thinking about something else than the activity they were doing at that moment (Yes/No). Thus, the present study conceptualizes mind wandering as TUTs. However, it is important to note that mind wandering has been increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous family of related mental states, rather than a unitary phenomenon (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Seli et&#160;al. 2018b</xref>). These include dimensions such as stimulus-independence, intentionality, and freedom of movement. Our operationalization focused solely on TUTs, without distinguishing between these subtypes. The following questions were asked in the &#8220;Yes&#8221; (mind wandering) branch: attention demanded by the current activity (<italic toggle="yes">none</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0; <italic toggle="yes">complete</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6) and the extent to which participants were thinking about the present, the past, and the future (<italic toggle="yes">not at all</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0; <italic toggle="yes">completely</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6). Scoring of temporal orientations was not mutually exclusive. While the questionnaire included additional items, which will be reported elsewhere, here we focus only on mind wandering probability and its temporal orientation. In the &#8220;No&#8221; (not mind wandering) branch after the initial question, participants answered how much attention their current activity demanded and additional items related to their current activity. We aimed to approximately balance the number of items in branches (11 questions in the &#8220;Yes,&#8221; while 8 in the &#8220;No&#8221; branches) to discourage participants from selecting the branch with significantly less questions just to save time. Question order in each branch was randomized in every sample sent to the participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analyses were performed in R Studio (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">R Studio Team 2023</xref>) (Version 2023.6.2.561). Models were constructed using the lme4 package (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bates et&#160;al. 2015</xref>). Time points of the samples were re-coded to hours since waking up by subtracting the wake-up time provided in the first sample of each day from the original sample time. We used hours since waking up as a temporal predictor variable and all the samples in the final dataset ranged from 0 to 17&#160;h since waking up. Data related to the temporal orientations of thoughts were transformed into the ratio of each temporal orientation. To calculate the ratio of each temporal orientation, scores of respective orientations on a numerical scale (0&#8211;6) were combined, and scores of each temporal orientation were divided by the combined temporal scores to get the ratio of each respective orientation. For example, if future, present, and past were scored 5, 2, and 2, respectively, the total score (9) and subsequently the ratio for each orientation were calculated, resulting in 0.56 future (5/9), 0.22 present (2/9), and 0.22 past (2/9) proportions.</p><p>As explained earlier, MEQ-H scores were used as a continuous measure to capture individual differences in chronotype and preferred sleep&#8211;wake behavior. For visualization and additional exploratory within-group analyses, participants were also categorized into chronotype groups (see <italic toggle="yes">Cross-sectional questionnaire</italic> section). To assess the alignment between participants&#8217; preferred and actual sleep&#8211;wake patterns, we calculated daily wake-up and bedtime misalignment scores. Preferred wake-up and bedtimes (from MEQ-H items Q1 and Q2, reported in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) were converted to numerical values by averaging the time ranges associated with each response option. These values were then subtracted from participants&#8217; reported daily wake-up and bedtimes to obtain individual daily misalignment scores. To test whether chronotype was associated with the wake&#8211;sleep misalignment, we used linear mixed models (LMMs) with standardized MEQ-H scores as a predictor and daily wake-up and bedtime misalignments, respectively, as outcomes. Additionally, we examined the association between MEQ-H scores and average sleep duration using Pearson correlation to assess whether sleep duration should be included as a control variable in models involving MEQ-H. Daily sleep durations were calculated based on reported wake-up and bedtimes, and individual means were used in the analysis.</p><p>Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and LMMs were used for data analysis to account for the nested data structure (multiple samples per participant). While both fixed and random effects were considered in our modeling approach, we included only random intercepts for <italic toggle="yes">participant ID</italic> in all final models. Although random slopes for <italic toggle="yes">hours since waking up</italic> could capture individual differences in daily patterns, preliminary attempts to fit such models resulted in convergence failures. Predictor variables were added to the models in a step-by-step process. To explore daily fluctuations of <italic toggle="yes">mind wandering probability</italic>, we initially constructed a binomial GLMM (logit link) with <italic toggle="yes">mind wandering</italic> as a binary outcome variable, <italic toggle="yes">hours since waking up</italic> as a fixed-effect predictor and <italic toggle="yes">participant ID</italic> as the random effect (<italic toggle="yes">mind wandering&#8201;~&#8201;time&#8201;+&#8201;(1 | ID)</italic>).

We additionally explored whether sleep&#8211;wake misalignment was associated with mind wandering probability. In an LMM, we included daily mind wandering probability (number of mind wandering&#8201;=&#8201;1 responses over all daily responses) as the outcome and entered both mean wake-up and bedtime misalignment (between-subject predictors), as well as daily deviations from each participant&#8217;s mean misalignment (within-subject predictors). Age and sex were included as covariates.</p><p>To explore daily fluctuations in each temporal orientation of mind wandering, we initially constructed three LMMs, one for each orientation, with the <italic toggle="yes">proportion of specific temporal orientation</italic> as the outcome variable, <italic toggle="yes">hours since waking up</italic> as a fixed-effect predictor and <italic toggle="yes">participant ID</italic> as a random effect (<italic toggle="yes">temporal orientation&#8201;~&#8201;time&#8201;+&#8201;(1 | ID)</italic>).

Importantly, <italic toggle="yes">MEQ</italic> alone did not significantly predict <italic toggle="yes">mind wandering probability;</italic> however, it exhibited a strong negative trend (see <xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, right column group). The interaction term of <italic toggle="yes">hours since waking up</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MEQ</italic> was not significant (see <xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, right column group). Contrary to our expectations, the association between <italic toggle="yes">hours since waking up</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">mind wandering probability</italic> was not significantly moderated by the <italic toggle="yes">MEQ score</italic>, pointing to a robust negative association of <italic toggle="yes">hours since waking up</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">mind wandering probability</italic> across the sample, regardless of chronotype (see <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">c</xref>).</p><p>We compared all three constructed models to identify the best-fitting one by comparing their AIC values. The model with the predictors <italic toggle="yes">hours since waking up</italic> in interaction with the <italic toggle="yes">MEQ score</italic>, in addition to the predictor <italic toggle="yes">attentional demands</italic> had the lowest AIC score (14 594.156) and was evaluated as the best fitting one. Comparison of the scores revealed a significant preference over the model with <italic toggle="yes">hours since waking up</italic> as the sole fixed-effect predictor (15 458.602) and a weak preference over the model with <italic toggle="yes">hours since waking up</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">attentional demands of the current activity</italic> (14 596.342).</p><p>As MEQ was significantly associated with both wake-up and bedtime misalignments (as discussed in the previous section), we additionally tested whether these misalignments predicted daily mind wandering probability. In this model, none of the predictors (mean wake-up misalignment, mean bedtime misalignment, nor their respective daily deviations) showed a significant effect.

Furthermore, our findings indicate an association between chronotype and the daily dynamics of temporal orientations of mind wandering. Specifically, eveningness is associated with an increase in future-oriented mind wandering and a decrease in present-oriented mind wandering throughout the day. In contrast, morningness is associated with a decrease in future-oriented mind wandering and an increase in present-oriented mind wandering across the day.</p><sec id="sec19"><title>Mind wandering and chronotype</title><p>The main aim of the present study was to use EMA to revisit the established synchrony effect hypothesis regarding daily dynamics of mind wandering. Previous research has demonstrated that mind wandering tends to occur more frequently at nonpreferred times of day depending on chronotype (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Carciofo et&#160;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Van Opstal et&#160;al. 2022</xref>). Accordingly, we hypothesized that evening chronotypes would experience higher mind wandering probability earlier in the day, while morning chronotypes would show increased mind wandering later in the day, when measured by experience sampling in everyday life. Contrary to this expectation, findings of the present study reveal that mind wandering probability decreased throughout the day for all chronotypes. The discrepancy between our findings and previous reports (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Carciofo et&#160;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Van Opstal et&#160;al. 2022</xref>) likely reflects important methodological differences. While prior studies used either retrospective questionnaires (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Carciofo et&#160;al. 2014</xref>) or thought probes during attention-demanding online tasks in the morning and evening sessions (<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Van Opstal et&#160;al. 2022</xref>), our dense EMA approach captured mind wandering dynamics with much greater ecological validity and temporal resolution. This intensive sampling method appears to reveal patterns of mind wandering dynamics, particularly the universal morning peak, that may be obscured by either retrospective biases or the constrained conditions of online task-based assessments. The high-frequency, real-time nature of EMA likely provides a more precise estimation of how mind wandering actually unfolds throughout the day across different chronotypes.</p><p>Nonetheless, the observed decrease in mind wandering probability points toward a possible link between the dynamics of spontaneous cognition and circadian functioning. Across all chronotypes in our sample, mind wandering probability peaked in the first few hours after waking up, gradually decreased throughout the day, reaching its minimum a few hours before sleep. One possible speculation is that maxima and minima of mind wandering probability are aligned with fluctuations in circadian waking drive and alertness. According to circadian models, waking drive and alertness are lowest during the night and begin to rise gradually in the early morning, reaching their peak in the evening hours (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et&#160;al. 2007</xref>). Importantly, in the period after waking up, alertness is still relatively low despite its upward trajectory. The observed peaks in mind wandering in the first few hours after waking up could be linked with the nature of this transitional period from sleep to wakefulness, characterized by impaired performance and reduced vigilance (sleep inertia), which can last from minutes to several hours (<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Trotti 2017</xref>). The link between sleep inertia, aligned with low circadian alertness, and an increased probability of mind wandering is arguably multifaceted. On the one hand, it could reflect a lack of focus, while on the other hand, propensity for spontaneous mental activity may help overcome the state of sleep inertia, priming an individual for the upcoming activities and challenges in the following hours, serving as an anticipatory mechanism.</p><p>Importantly, however, contrary to our findings, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#160;al. (2018)</xref> observed that TUTs increased throughout the day, peaking in the evening hours. While the findings of the present study suggest that the highest mind wandering probability aligns with the period of sleep inertia, characterized by still low levels of alertness, the findings of <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#160;al. (2018)</xref> propose that the highest rates of TUTs occur at times of day when generally higher levels of alertness are reported (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et&#160;al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Valdez et&#160;al. 2012</xref>). While both studies used EMA and employed university student samples with comparable sample sizes (our <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;152 vs. their <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;165, though Smith et&#160;al. did not report age or sex distributions), several methodological differences might help explain the discrepancy in findings. The most notable difference lies in our experience sampling approach. While we used personalized windows aligned with each participant&#8217;s sleep&#8211;wake cycle, Smith et&#160;al. employed a fixed 08:00&#8211;23:00 window for all participants and did not measure and control for chronotype. Their approach may have missed important variations at the extremes of the daily cycle&#8212;immediately after waking and before bedtime, that could influence the overall pattern. That said, it is unclear whether this difference alone could account for the opposing trends we observed. Another potentially important distinction concerns how mind wandering was measured. Our binary (yes/no) assessment captured the presence of mind wandering, while their 7-point scale may have reflected additional dimensions like thought intensity. Considering <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Seli et&#160;al. (2018a)</xref>, these different measurement approaches might measure related but distinct aspects of mind wandering that could vary differently across the day. Future directions are discussed later on.</p><p>Our analysis showed an insignificant association between chronotype and mind wandering probability, only pointing to a negative trend. This trend is broadly consistent with previous findings suggesting that eveningness is related to generally higher mind wandering (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Carciofo et&#160;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Van Opstal et&#160;al. 2022</xref>), though our data do not provide robust support for this association. It is possible that previously discussed methodological differences result in attenuated association between mind wandering probability and chronotype. Given the nonsignificant result, we avoid overinterpreting this trend and emphasize the need for caution in drawing firm conclusions. We outline future directions in a later section.</p><p>Our additional analysis revealed no significant effect of sleep&#8211;wake misalignment on daily mind wandering probability. While we do not wish to overinterpret this null finding, we find it informative, as it suggests that the degree of alignment between individual sleep&#8211;wake rhythms and external schedules may not directly influence daily mind wandering probability.</p><p>As previously reported, the overall probability of mind wandering in our sample was 34.8% (95% CI [31.9%, 37.6%]). This closely aligns with the mean mind wandering rate of 34.5% (95% CI [29.6%, 39.4%]) reported in a recent meta-analysis of 16 EMA mind wandering studies (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Kawashima et&#160;al. 2023</xref>). Importantly, the study reported that the specific operational definition of mind wandering&#8212;whether studies included only TUTs or also stimulus-independent TUTs (SITUTs) did not substantially impact reported rates. Although we operationalized mind wandering as TUTs, our findings are consistent with the broader EMA literature.</p></sec><sec id="sec20"><title>Temporal orientations of mind wandering and chronotype</title><p>Morningness was associated with a decrease in future-oriented mind wandering throughout the day, while eveningness was associated with an increase, implying a potential link between circadian functioning and the occurrence of future-oriented thoughts. The findings of the study by <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Smallwood et&#160;al. (2009)</xref> suggested that individuals experience more future-oriented mind wandering during cognitively undemanding tasks, as they arguably allow greater allocation of cognitive resources to (the potentially demanding) simulation of future events and activities. Given that executive functioning of different chronotypes is better at the preferred times of the day (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et&#160;al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Hahn et&#160;al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Lara et&#160;al. 2014</xref>), it can be speculated that individuals can take advantage of these peak periods for mentalizing and simulating future events and activities. Another, more parsimonious interpretation could relate to how chronotypes organize their daily activities. As studies suggest that mind wandering is characterized by autobiographical planning (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Mooneyham and Schooler 2013</xref>), the timing of planned activities may influence when individuals engage in mental preparation for these activities. Morning chronotypes typically wake early and engage in activities earlier in the day, leading to spontaneous planning of upcoming activities in the morning hours, while evening chronotypes show the opposite pattern, with both activity engagement and future-oriented planning occurring later in the day.</p><p>Regarding past-oriented mind wandering, our results indicate that neither time of day nor the interaction between time of day and chronotype predicted it. Compared to future- and present-oriented mind wandering, past-oriented mind wandering seems less influenced by time of day, possibly suggesting that the association with underlying circadian functions is much less pronounced than in other temporal orientations. However, it is possible that a more pronounced association between time of day and past-oriented thoughts might be present in individuals with depressive symptomatology, as past-oriented thinking in the form of rumination is more accentuated in such individuals (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Nolen-Hoeksema et&#160;al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>Considering the daily dynamics of present-oriented mind wandering, morningness was associated with an increase in present-oriented mind wandering throughout the day, while eveningness was associated with a decrease. Our conceptualization of mind wandering (TUTs) includes stimulus-dependent thoughts, perhaps related to external distractions. Previous studies have reported that inhibitory control is better at preferred parts of the day (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Lara et&#160;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">May and Hasher 1998</xref>). A highly speculative interpretation of the observed differences between chronotypes in daily fluctuations in present-oriented mind wandering is that it perhaps reflects the ability to inhibit redirection of attention from the primary task to other distractions present in the immediate environment. Consequently, such present-oriented thoughts, while task-unrelated, could be dominantly stimulus-dependent. This is currently not directly supported by the present dataset, as additionally discussed in the next section.</p><p>In contrast to much of the existing literature, our study found that mind wandering was most often present-oriented (43.9%), followed closely by future-oriented thoughts (39.5%), with past-oriented thoughts being the least dominant (15.6%). This contrasts with the relatively consistent prospective bias reported in previous lab-based experience sampling (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Smallwood et&#160;al. 2009</xref>, <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Baird et&#160;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Stawarczyk et&#160;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Ruby et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Seli et&#160;al. 2017</xref>) and EMA studies (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Song and Wang 2012</xref>, <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Poerio et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Spronken et&#160;al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Nakatani et&#160;al. 2019</xref>). Differences with lab-based studies may arise because, compared to controlled laboratory settings, daily life involves more engaging or salient present-moment stimuli (e.g. social interactions, sensory input), which could increase present-focused mind wandering. Differences from other EMA studies may be due to some measuring only past vs. future thoughts or placing them on a bipolar axis, thus excluding present-oriented options (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Poerio et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Spronken et&#160;al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Nakatani et&#160;al. 2019</xref>). Additionally, some studies differed in operationalization by focusing on narrower SITUTs rather than broader TUTs (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Song and Wang 2012</xref>). Recommendations for future studies are discussed in the following section.</p><p>While we observed a significant association between age and the proportion of present-oriented thoughts, any concrete interpretation of this finding would be premature. Our sample was relatively homogeneous and likely did not capture the broader range of age-related variation present in more demographically diverse populations.</p></sec><sec id="sec21"><title>Mind wandering content dynamics and chronotype&#8212;Future directions</title><p>Taken together, the opposing daily patterns of future- and present-oriented thought in morning and evening chronotypes may reflect fluctuations in alertness and executive functioning across the day, though we emphasize that this interpretation remains speculative and is not directly supported by the current dataset. While peak cognitive resources during preferred times of day could facilitate cognitively demanding, future-oriented thinking, suboptimal periods may instead give rise to more present-oriented mind wandering involving lapses of attention and mind blanking. However, this account is complicated by our observation that mind wandering probability peaked uniformly across chronotypes during the period shortly after waking. We might tentatively speculate that although all individuals experience heightened mind wandering during this transitional period, its qualitative nature may differ by chronotype: for morning types, early mind wandering may rapidly become adaptive and goal-directed as they approach their optimal circadian functioning, whereas for evening types, it may remain more passive or fragmented until later in the day.</p><p>These considerations point to the importance of going beyond temporal orientation and examining other phenomenological dimensions of mind wandering, such as intentionality, goal-directedness, and stimulus-dependence, to help distinguish potentially adaptive from maladaptive forms, as previously discussed (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Lenartowicz et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Ruby et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Mittner et&#160;al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Unsworth and Robison 2018</xref>). We emphasize that our current data do not allow us to explore these distinctions directly, as our results conflict with previous studies (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Carciofo et&#160;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Van Opstal et&#160;al. 2022</xref>), and do not offer unequivocal support for key existing frameworks linking executive functioning and mind wandering (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">McVay and Kane 2009</xref>, <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Smallwood and Schooler 2006</xref>), as different chronotype groups may exhibit patterns consistent with different theoretical accounts. We offer this interpretation primarily as a conceptual scaffold for future research.</p><p>To advance understanding of how mind wandering dynamics and content relate to chronotype, future research should consider the following directions: First, incorporating both chronotype assessment and personalized sampling windows would help capture more ecologically valid patterns of individuals&#8217; daily cognition. Sampling participants across an even broader chronotype spectrum, including more extreme morningness and eveningness, would increase chronotype representation and statistical power. Second, future studies should assess multiple experiential dimensions of mind wandering, including occurrence, intensity, intentionality, goal-directedness etc., to enable a more nuanced understanding of its daily dynamics and potential subtypes. Third, temporal orientations should be examined across past, present, and future, rather than treating past and future as opposing poles. Moreover, measuring the stimulus dependence of present-oriented thoughts would help determine whether such thoughts reflect attentional shifts to the environment or more simulative, internally generated processes. Fourth, concurrent assessments of alertness and executive functioning using both self-report measures and cognitive tasks could clarify how fluctuations in these domains shape both the probability and content of mind wandering in relation to chronotype. Fifth, better tracking of sleep-related factors, such as sleep quality, sleep fragmentation, REM sleep characteristics, and the effects of sleep inertia, would shed light on how chronotype-related differences in sleep-related factors relate to differences in mind wandering dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="sec22"><title>Limitations and implications</title><p>Several limitations in our study should be addressed. First, using binary response options to assess the presence of mind wandering could lead to ambiguity in self-assessment. Individuals might have problems evaluating whether they were thinking about something other than the activity they were currently doing if their mind wandered for a brief moment or if their mind had been continuously wandering for a prolonged period. A more nuanced response scale would allow participants to determine to what degree they engaged in mind wandering more accurately.</p><p>Second, the demographic characteristics of our predominantly female (83%) and young (<italic toggle="yes">M</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;21.7&#160;years) university sample warrant careful consideration. While adolescents and young adults generally show stronger evening preferences (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Randler et&#160;al. 2016</xref>), young women tend to be more morning-oriented than young men (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Randler and Engelke 2019</xref>). These opposing effects may have contributed to a more balanced chronotype distribution in our homogeneous sample. Our exploratory quartile-based groupings (MEQ-H scores: evening: &lt;30; intermediate: 30&#8211;39; morning: &gt;39) reflect relative chronotype tendencies within this specific population rather than absolute classifications present in the general population. These categorical distinctions should therefore be interpreted as specific to young adults with structured university schedules.</p><p>Furthermore, while laboratory-based experience sampling studies consistently report decreased mind wandering propensity with aging (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">McVay et&#160;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Irish et&#160;al. 2019</xref>), our EMA findings do not support this pattern, as we found no significant age effect on mind wandering probability. However, this null result requires cautious consideration given our sample&#8217;s homogeneity and limited age representation. While the literature shows inconsistent findings regarding age and the temporal orientation of mind wandering (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Maillet et&#160;al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Irish et&#160;al. 2019</xref>), our observed decrease in present-oriented focus with age should be treated cautiously, as our homogeneous sample arguably cannot adequately capture the broader age-related patterns present in more demographically diverse populations.</p><p>While in the present study we focused specifically on TUTs, we acknowledge that mind wandering is increasingly understood as a heterogeneous construct encompassing multiple dimensions, such as stimulus-independence, intentionality, and freedom of movement (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Seli et&#160;al. 2018b</xref>). Studies have shown that beyond the theoretical framework, these dimensions can be empirically disentangled (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Mills et&#160;al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#160;al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Kam et&#160;al. 2021</xref>). It would be valuable for future research to incorporate items that explicitly distinguish between different conceptualisations of mind wandering. This would enable a more nuanced understanding of how distinct forms of mind wandering relate to chronotype and differ in their daily trajectories, as well as their associations with other dimensions of mind wandering, such as temporal orientation. The latter is especially important, as the proportions of temporal orientations may vary substantially across different operationalizations (e.g. present-oriented thoughts might be less dominant in stimulus-independent compared to stimulus-dependent TUTs). Moreover, an important limitation is that we did not assess participants&#8217; concurrent activities during mind wandering reports. The type and nature of activities (e.g. passive lectures versus immersive recreational activities) could substantially influence mind wandering patterns beyond the attentional demands of the current activity measured in our study. Our design prioritized core questions to minimize participant burden, but future research should include activity assessments to disentangle these contextual effects.</p><p>Findings of the present study have important implications for research and everyday life settings. They highlight the importance of considering time of day and chronotype when designing research studies on mind wandering. We discussed directions for future studies in the previous section, as our findings provide a solid foundation for generating new hypotheses about the relationship between circadian rhythms, chronotype, mind wandering, and its temporal orientation. Considering everyday life, our findings highlight the importance of considering the daily dynamics of mind wandering when scheduling study- and work-related activities. While the observed increased rates of mind wandering across all participants in the first hours after awakening suggest that cognitively demanding activities might be at risk of worsened performance in the early parts of the day, there might be positive aspects to this observation. Activities and university courses requiring more free-roaming, associative, and spontaneous mental states (e.g. idea brainstorming, artistic expression, courses involving creative writing, etc.) might benefit from scheduling in the hours when individuals are more susceptible to mind wandering.</p><p>In the context of therapeutic settings, allowing one&#8217;s mind to wander might reveal important suppressed or repressed material, shedding light on underlying concerns, emotional issues, and difficulties with goal-setting and achievement (<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Stan and Christoff 2018</xref>). Taking an individual&#8217;s proneness to mind wandering into account, such contents might arise with less difficulty when therapeutic sessions are scheduled at specific parts of the day.</p><p>Our findings suggest that considering an individual&#8217;s chronotype might play an important role in deciding which mental contents are addressed in such settings. Evening chronotypes might benefit more if future plans, goals, and challenges are addressed in the latter parts of the day. At the same time, this might be naturally easier for morning chronotypes at the beginning of the day.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec23"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Findings of the present study revealed that time of day predicted mind wandering probability as it decreased throughout the day, even when attentional demands of the current activity are considered. However, no differences in these associations were observed between chronotypes. Additionally, we found that chronotype moderated the daily dynamics of future- and present-oriented mind wandering. While eveningness was associated with an increase in the proportion of future-oriented thoughts and a decrease in that of present-oriented thoughts throughout the day, the opposite was found for morningness. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual circadian preferences and time of day in research and everyday life settings. Future research should build on these findings and extend the investigation to behavioral and neurophysiological measures of executive functioning and alertness to further explore associations between mind wandering, underlying circadian functioning, and chronotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1"
