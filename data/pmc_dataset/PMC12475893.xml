<bold>What did you want to address in this study and why?</bold>
</p><p>Hospital diagnostics are vital for patient care but limited for timely surveillance: they miss mild or asymptomatic infections, may detect viruses only after community spread, and overlook pathogens not routinely tested. We investigated whether indoor-air monitoring can reveal viruses circulating in the community.</p><p>
<bold>What have you learnt from this study?</bold>
</p><p>In 2022, air samples from a daycare centre were tested for genetic material of either (i) specific viruses with qPCR techniques or (ii) of any virus with a metagenomics method. In 40 of 42 total samples collected during the year, human viruses were detected, despite children at the daycare appearing healthy. Tracking skin, respiratory, or enteric viruses through indoor air sampling was feasible. Known and new viruses could be simultaneously detected.</p><p>
<bold>What are the implications of your findings for public health?</bold>
</p><p>Indoor air monitoring can complement current virus surveillance systems by detecting known and novel viruses. Tracking viruses in the community before detections in hospitals occur, may allow health officials to more timely prevent their circulation among people, gain more information on their epidemiology and improve outbreak responses.</p></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Conventionally, infectious disease surveillance has revolved around patient-centred approaches, focusing on specific diseases or syndromes (e.g. respiratory, enteric symptoms) using methods such as pathogen culturing and molecular techniques (PCR or quantitative (q)PCR panels) on individual patient samples [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While individual diagnostics can be valuable for immediate patient care or to assess the extent of an outbreak, these methods are often underused for broader surveillance due to cost, invasiveness and failure to detect less common or novel viruses [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, due to their focus on illness, they tend to miss mild or asymptomatic infections. Therefore, environmental surveillance has emerged as a relevant complement to individual testing for tracking pathogens in larger populations, allowing to monitor viral circulation in communities without relying on patient sampling.</p><p>Since the 2010s, environmental surveillance for pathogens in media such as wastewater, soil, rivers, and indoor air, has attracted growing interest, with wastewater being the most widely used method [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Wastewater analysis has effectively complemented other surveillance systems by tracking severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the variants of concern of this virus, and other respiratory and enteric pathogens using targeted PCR methods [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, wastewater surveillance has limitations, including reduced precision in pinpointing specific locations or population subgroups, potential delays or signal dilution due to rainfall, and dependency on water usage [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As an alternative approach, indoor air sampling can be performed using active or passive samplers, with sampling conducted at specific locations for precise surveillance purposes. Active air sampling facilitates immediate sample collection within a short time frame and offers higher sensitivity, as demonstrated especially in studies on SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In 2023 and 2024, our teams and others have demonstrated the potential of active indoor air sampling for monitoring viruses [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This method has successfully identified a variety of viruses, including respiratory and enteric viruses (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza C, human parainfluenza virus) in community settings.</p><p>The methodologies employed to detect pathogens in environmental surveillance are usually similar to those employed in clinical diagnostics [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], frequently using molecular based single- or multi-targeted (qPCR or multiplex qPCR) tests. Targeted test methods tend to have high sensitivity and specificity. Previously, some studies have focused on the detection of viruses and bacteria with targeted methods from indoor air of various community settings [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], revealing temporal trends of virus circulation among specific populations and highlighting the early warning potential of indoor air sampling in real-world situations. However, for more precise genetic identification or subtyping, additional techniques such as Sanger sequencing or whole genome sequencing (WGS) are often necessary. Characterising novel or variant viruses can be challenging with both methods, because they require specific genetic sequence knowledge of viruses of interest.</p><p>Next generation sequencing (NGS)-based 'untargeted' shotgun metagenomic methods can overcome this limitation. These methods often use a combination of viral enrichment, followed by deep sequencing using various NGS technologies and appropriate bioinformatic tools [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An established method, Novel Enrichment Techniques of Viromes (NetoVIR) [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], has proven effective for viral enrichment across various sample types, including faecal [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], insect [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and plant samples [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], facilitating virome analysis with minimal bias and the discovery of novel viruses. This approach allows to identify pathogens and provide genomic insights as a 'pathogen-agnostic' tool [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For indoor air surveillance, NGS faces challenges such as low biomass and contaminating nucleic acid, despite its relatively cleaner nature compared with soil, wastewater or stool [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Nevertheless, Minor et al<italic toggle="yes">.</italic> used RNA virus-targeted NGS to analyse 20 samples from various indoor community settings. They detected not only respiratory viruses such as influenza A and C, but also rotaviruses and astrovirus, which are transmitted through the faecal&#8211;oral route [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In this study, air samples spanning a full year at a daycare centre were subjected to qPCR and untargeted metagenomics, to investigate the viruses they contained and better understand the indoor air virome and its dynamics. In addition, our objective was to explore the potential for viral surveillance of air sampling combined with metagenomics with reference-guided and <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> bioinformatics approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Setting and sample collection </title><p>Between January 2022 and December 2022, 90 indoor air samples were collected from a daycare centre in Leuven, hosting children aged 0 to 3&#8201;years old (with on an average day, 15 children and 3 adults aged&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;18&#8201;years old occupying the establishment). </p><p>We aimed to have from each month at least four samples (collected on a weekly basis), to explore different methods of virus detection and genetic analysis. However, after using parts of each sample for testing with the respiratory qPCR panel and initial optimisation of our assays, sufficient material was left to conduct metagenomic and enteric qPCR panel testing on 42 samples.</p><p>Sampling was done for 2&#8201;hours between 9.00 and 11.00 am in the changing room of the daycare centre which has the air extraction vents, and which is connected by two open doors to the main area where children are present. When the daycare centre was closed (e.g. holidays), no samples were collected. </p><p>For sampling, an AerosolSense active air sampler was used [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ambient air was sampled with a rate of 200&#8201;L/min through a vertical collection pipe and impacted onto the AerosolSense Capture Media (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,&#8201;Massachusetts (MA)). This method captures particles suspended in the air&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which may include resuspended surface dust&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;while avoiding particles following a semi-ballistic trajectory.</p><p>Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) were measured using a remote climate sensor (Elsys ERC CO2, Ume&#229;, Sweden; placed next to the air sampler). Natural ventilation was also estimated by a Likert scale (no natural ventilation, one window open, door open, multiple windows open, door and window open).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample processing</title><p>After removing the standard cartridges from the sampler, samples were transported to the laboratory on the same day that they were collected. Samples were dissolved in 2&#8201;mL of universal transport medium (UTM), to be used for respiratory and enteric multiplex qPCR panels as well as metagenomics (see below). Samples were stored at 4&#8201;&#176;C until processing with the respiratory multiplex qPCR panel, which was conducted, whenever possible, on the same day as the sample collection. If storage was required over the weekend, samples were frozen at&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;80&#8201;&#176;C. For the respiratory panel, 200&#8201;&#181;L of each sample was used. The remaining volume was immediately stored at &#8722;&#8201;20&#8201;&#176;C until proceeding with metagenomics and the enteric qPCR panel, which occurred in February 2023, on samples which had undergone two or less freeze&#8722;thaw cycles. As negative controls, UTM (used to dissolve samples) was processed in parallel and sequenced as deep as samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Respiratory and enteric multiplex qPCR panels</title><p>Samples dissolved in UTM were subjected to multiplex qPCR testing. The detailed protocols for these procedures have been previously described [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The respiratory panel is designed to detect 22 viruses and seven bacterial pathogens and was applied on 90 samples when they were collected. In addition, the enteric panel detects 17 non-viral pathogens (4 parasites and 13 bacteria) and six viruses, specifically human adenovirus F40/F41, norovirus GI, norovirus GII, rotavirus A, astrovirus, and sapovirus (genogroups GI, GII, GIV, and GV). The enteric panel was applied to the same 42 samples used for shotgun metagenomics (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Shotgun metagenomics</title><p>Samples were subjected to NetoVIR [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. They were homogenised by vortexing for 10&#8201;seconds and homogenous samples were centrifuged at 17,000&#8201;g for 3&#8201;min and filtered with a 0.8&#8201;&#181;m polyethersulfone (PES) centrifugal filter to eliminate eukaryotic cells and bacteria. Free floating nucleic acids were removed by benzonase and micrococcal nuclease while being incubated for 2&#8201;hours at 37&#8201;&#176;C. A modified Whole Transcriptome Amplification 2 (WTA2) kit was used to amplify both DNA and RNA. To obtain DNA amplification, the initial denaturation step was performed at 95&#8201;&#176;C instead of 70&#8201;&#176;C. Library preparation was done using a Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit and sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq platform (Illumina).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical data collection</title><p>At the daycare centre &#8212; where samples were collected &#8212; parents were advised to keep their children at home if they exhibited any symptoms of illness such as fever, runny nose, or diarrhoea. This led to our study population consisting of seemingly &#8216;healthy&#8217; or asymptomatic individuals.</p><p>We collected the results of respiratory panel tests for enterovirus (including rhinovirus) performed at the clinical laboratory of University Hospitals Leuven during the same period as the air sample collection. The PCR targets also included non-rhinovirus enteroviruses. Clinical respiratory qPCR panels are performed according to specific clinical indications. In immunocompetent individuals, these panels are used for respiratory infections requiring intensive care admission or those unresponsive to initial therapy for a respiratory infection. For immunocompromised patients, respiratory panels are more commonly used when lower respiratory tract infections are suspected.</p><p>For rotavirus A infections in the age group of 0 to 3&#8201;years old, we used data from the national reference centre (NRC) for rotavirus in Leuven, Belgium in 2022. Samples of the NRC were collected through the nationwide laboratory system on a voluntary basis and under the regulations defined by the Royal Decree of 09/02/2011 [<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatics analyses</title><p>We employed reference-guided assembly and <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly on the reads obtained from sequencing. Analyses were conducted on the Flemish Supercomputer Center &#8216;Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum&#8217; (VSC) KU Leuven servers.</p><sec><title>Reference-guided assembly</title><p>To identify human and animal-associated viruses, we used EsViritu [<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (v0.2.3) and nucleotide (nt) basic local alignment tool (BLASTN). EsViritu employs a database of all human and animal viruses in GenBank up to 16 November 2022 (EsViritu DB v2.0.2), curated to include one representative genome per 95% average nt identity cluster. Reads underwent quality control, adapter trimming, and mapping to reference sequences with 90% identity and 90% coverage. Viruses were considered present if the consensus sequence exceeded 200&#8201;bp or 10% of the reference genome and at least two reads mapped to it. Consensus sequences were obtained using Samtools consensus [<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and subsequently verified using BLASTN. Reference-guided assembly only showed human papillomavirus (HPV)-21 with 39 reads in one negative control, which resulted in a 236-nt long consensus sequence, found to be identical to that from a higher viral load sample with the same virus, and was therefore classified as cross-contamination from this sample.</p></sec><sec><title>
<italic toggle="yes">De novo</italic> assembly</title><p>For <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly of viral genomes (or contigs), we used the Virome Paired-End Reads pipeline (ViPER) [<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Contigs were then clustered at 95% identity and 85% coverage to reduce redundancy, first within individual samples and then among all samples. Reads were mapped back to contigs&#8201;&gt;&#8201;1&#8201;kbp, considering those with over 50% horizontal coverage present in each sample. Contig identification was subsequently performed using DIAMOND [<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] for eukaryotic viruses, geNomad [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] for bacteriophages, and BLASTN for identification of genetic material associated to other entities (i.e. fungi, plant, human). For <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly, all contigs present in negative controls were treated as contaminants and removed before downstream analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses for the difference of detections in the daycare&#8217;s open and closed window periods of non-human infecting and human-infecting viruses were conducted using the chi-square test and performed in RStudio.

These methods led us to uncover not only known viruses with very low abundance, but also novel and divergent viruses, making it potentially useful to identify &#8216;pathogen X&#8217;&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;an epidemic or pandemic viral pathogen that is not yet characterised [<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>Rosario et al. previously observed Merkel cell polyomavirus, MW polyomavirus and papillomaviruses in air filter samples collected in dormitory rooms [<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Similarly, polyomaviruses were the most abundant human viruses revealed through our work, including WU polyomavirus, a respiratory virus reported in immunocompromised people and in children with minimal or no respiratory symptoms [<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We also detected MW polyomavirus as well as Merkel cell polyomavirus, both also prior documented among asymptomatic individuals [<xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Interestingly, alongside the human viruses we found, the most abundant fungal viruses were related to commensal human skin fungi from the family <italic toggle="yes">Malasseziaceae</italic>, providing evidence for the high abundance of human skin-associated microorganisms in the environment. Therefore, our findings suggest a potential of indoor air sampling for surveillance of skin-associated viruses.</p><p>Several recent studies have investigated the potential of indoor air surveillance to monitor specific viral pathogen dynamics and epidemiology. These were conducted in settings such as hospitals, offices, and residential environments [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>-<xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. All of them relied on targeted tests requiring specific viral genomic knowledge, while we employed a non-targeted approach. The longitudinal design of our investigation, in combination with available epidemiological data from the University Hospitals Leuven and NRCs allowed us to use rhinovirus and rotavirus as examples to showcase the power of air sampling in epidemiological surveillance, especially for asymptomatic circulation in a setting with no clinically ill individuals. In addition, our NGS-based untargeted methodology allowed us to subtype rhinoviruses, showing the co-circulation of various rhinoviruses throughout the year.</p><p>In a non-longitudinal study, Minor et al. examined indoor air from multiple locations with metagenomics, detecting influenza C in a preschool and providing genomic data for this frequently untested virus [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We expanded their approach by seeking multiple complete or partial genomes of viruses, which may be associated with respiratory (e.g. WU polyomavirus) or skin diseases but are not currently included in the routine qPCR panels for respiratory diseases in hospitals. Additionally, we were able to identify and subtype several viruses (e.g. bocaviruses, RSV) and distinguish the co-circulation of closely related virus variants (WU polyomavirus) over time. This underscores the possible simultaneous use of shotgun metagenomics to determine the presence, frequency and changing genomic/epidemiological characteristics of multiple viruses.</p><p>Beyond surveillance of human viruses, indoor air and environmental surveillance with metagenomics could also be of interest for animal farms and greenhouses. Kwok et al. analysed dust samples and pooled chicken faeces from farms using shotgun metagenomics, identifying multiple viruses in dust that matched those found in the faeces from the same location [<xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In our study, we unexpectedly detected avian viruses (rotaviruses and a divergent polyomavirus), a cat papillomavirus, and several insect-infecting viruses, including a novel densovirus, in an animal-free environment. We suggest that the animal and plant viruses mentioned are highly resilient in the environment and may be transported indoors by insects, air currents, or even on human skin or garments that can subsequently shed them. Additionally, the presence of multiple plant viruses demonstrates that indoor air can serve as an effective medium for detecting pathogens that typically require labour-intensive sampling from various crops. Therefore, we propose that indoor air surveillance in strategic animal and plant production locations can be powerful for revealing epidemiological trends and potential outbreaks of viruses.</p><p>It was previously reported that indoor air shotgun metagenomics with other methods resulted in 1% to 3.2% of reads that could be assigned to viruses [<xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], underscoring the low viral biomass of indoor air samples. However, using the NetoVIR protocol, 10.9% of reads mapped to viral contigs, primarily phages, aligning with earlier findings [<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Interestingly, shotgun metagenomics identified a broader diversity of enteric viruses, such as rotavirus and sapovirus, compared with the enteric qPCR panel, whereas the respiratory qPCR panel detected rhinovirus, RSV, adenovirus, and parainfluenza more consistently than metagenomics. These differences likely stem from the distinct sensitivities of the qPCR panels, which are tailored for detecting specific viral loads in defined sample types. The viral load in indoor air is likely at or near detection thresholds, with commonly circulating human viruses comprising less than 0.005% of total reads, as reported by Prussin et al. [<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In our study, we confirm this low viral load of human-associated viruses in indoor air apart from skin- and respiratory-associated polyomaviruses.</p><p>Given the longitudinal nature of our sample collection, it is possible to discuss seasonality of viruses. Prussin et al. employed passive indoor air sampling and shotgun metagenomics throughout the year in a daycare centre in Virginia, US. They found human-associated viruses to be much more diverse and dominant in the winter, while the summertime virome contained a higher proportion and diversity of plant-associated viruses [<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Similarly, we also observed a higher prevalence of animal- or plant-associated viruses, particularly during the warmer months from April to October when windows were open and respiratory and enteric viruses mostly during the wintertime when windows were closed. Therefore, we suggest that active indoor air sampling can reflect dynamics of both the inside and outside environment. On the other hand, human parainfluenza virus 3 was detected in winter by indoor air sampling at the daycare centre, which is different than its defined peak in the literature, late spring and early summer.</p><p>Overall, untargeted viral metagenomics offers a strong and complementary tool for pathogen surveillance via indoor air, particularly in cases of suspected asymptomatic shedding. In practice, we would propose a surveillance system where samples are collected at regular intervals from a small number of strategically selected sentinel locations&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;ideally in ventilation shafts to capture air from multiple indoor spaces in each sample while further minimising the invasiveness of such sampling approach for the community [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This approach can leverage established specialised laboratory infrastructure and standardised workflows; with declining sequencing costs due to pooled/batched sample processing. This could result in early signals of beginning epidemic trends of seasonal, emerging and re-emerging pathogens, while at the same time providing genetic information for further characterisation. Timely information collected on viral (co-) circulation at the community level can be used to prepare the healthcare system for viral circulation. Moreover, metagenomics enables detailed genomic analyses and identification variants, which may eventually serve as a proxy for estimating the number of infected hosts or introductory events at a specific location. Future research should validate this approach at sentinel locations for skin, enteric, and respiratory viruses in targeted settings, ideally incorporating clinical data of individuals.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Primarily, it was conducted at a single location, without access to information regarding the health status or medical history of individuals in the vicinity. Nonetheless, it was assumed that individuals were unlikely to exhibit severe respiratory or gastroenteritis-related symptoms, as it was recommended that families keep children at home if they displayed such symptoms. Secondly, we could not acquire complete genomes for numerous viruses that were present, which may stem from some methodological constraints of sequencing and low viral loads in the air. Additionally, our results are not confirmed by culture-based techniques to determine if the detected viral genomes are from infectious viruses or not. This would be important information, with respect to the potential of airborne transmission of skin-associated and enteric viruses, since dose-risk relationships of many viruses are not well understood. On the other hand, we employed a longitudinal approach over a 12-month period, allowing to monitor seasonal dynamics and use advanced viral enrichment methods with comprehensive analyses, which enhanced our ability to detect even low-abundance viral species with greater sensitivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study highlights that indoor air sampling employed with viral metagenomics is a robust method for surveillance of both human-associated and non-human-associated viruses.
