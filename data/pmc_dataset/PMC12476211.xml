</p></notes></front><body><p>Physicians play an indispensable role in clinical research, but one that often contains conflicting obligations and ethical responsibilities. As key members of the clinical research team, physicians advance the primary mission of research to discover generalizable knowledge. As medical professionals, they are also duty bound to &#8220;first do no harm&#8221; and to promote the well&#8208;being of individuals with whom they have a professional relationship, even if it is not a traditional physician&#8208;patient relationship.</p><p>Physicians conducting clinical research are mostly academic physicians and private practice physicians retained by pharmaceutical companies or research institutions. According to one study of private practice physicians in research, &#8220;physicians primarily envisage ethics in terms of adhering to the study protocols that pharmaceutical companies hire them to conduct.&#8221;<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> It is also likely that many academic physicians performing research at large research institutions also view compliance with an institutional review board (IRB)&#8208;approved study protocol as their primary ethical responsibility.</p><p>Physicians&#8217; roles in clinical research vary widely, ranging from serving as principal investigators to merely examining potential participants to determine whether they meet inclusion criteria. Poorly understood or ill&#8208;defined aspects of the relationship between research physicians and research participants can undermine both clinical research and the welfare of the participants. By clarifying and modestly supplementing the relationship through disclosures and minimum standards, research physicians can protect research participants from undue harm without undermining physicians&#8217; ability to perform their essential role in clinical research.</p><p>Although it is arguable that all researchers ought to follow the ethical principles discussed in this article, physicians are the leaders of the medical component of clinical research and they are subject to detailed ethical precepts. The proposed Bill of Rights for research participants enrolled in clinical studies seeks to promote the interests of clinical research participants by harmonizing physicians&#8217; traditional ethical obligations with the distinct demands of clinical research. It also seeks to supplement provisions in the Common Rule applicable to all researchers with more focused rights for participants when interacting with research physicians.</p><sec id="eahr60035-sec-0020"><title>RELATIONSHIP OF PHYSICIANS AND RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS</title><p>The possibility of discovering generalizable knowledge to improve human health is the ethical justification for research physicians to engage in practices that would often fail to meet the standard of care or conflict with ethical precepts of medical practice. For example, performing a biopsy, lumbar puncture, and imaging procedure is justified in clinical care only if the procedure contributes to diagnosis or treatment; but such procedures may be justified in clinical research when necessary to answer important scientific questions despite not being medically indicated.&#8221;<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> address the physician&#8208;participant relationship. IRBs and research funders routinely approve protocols with medical provisions that depart from the standard of care and principles of medical ethics applicable in practice settings. Many research protocols explicitly or implicitly apply different ethical standards to clinical research.</p><p>Notwithstanding the reality that different ethical standards apply to physicians engaged in clinical research, codes of medical ethics provide to the contrary&#8212;that the ethical obligations of physicians in clinical research are substantially the same as in clinical settings. Ethics Opinion 7.1.1 of the American Medical Association (AMA) states that physicians who are involved in research should &#8220;[d]emonstrate the same care and concern for the well&#8208;being of research participants that they would for patients to whom they provide clinical care in a therapeutic relationship.&#8221;<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>Similarly, paragraph 4 of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki provides: &#8220;It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well&#8208;being, and rights of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.&#8221;<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>The consequences of a divergence between customary research practices and codes of medical ethics are not merely semantic or academic. If participants regard research as a form of medical care, often referred to as &#8220;therapeutic misconception,&#8221;<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref> they might erroneously think that medical examinations or procedures during research eliminate the need for regular, comprehensive medical care. In addition, some patients in clinical trials who consent to undergo tests or procedures involving greater than minimal risk or discomfort may not realize that there may be little or no prospect of diagnostic or therapeutic benefit to them. Even more troubling, if physical examinations, laboratory tests, or imaging performed in research indicate a potentially serious medical problem, physicians might be prevented (or at least not encouraged or required) by some protocols from informing the research participant, thereby delaying essential medical care.</p><p>There has been little empirical research on disclosure of incidental findings in research. The most detailed study found that relatively few research guidance documents available on the internet from four main groups even mention incidental findings (federal government 9%; professional societies 25%; universities 11%; and web&#8208;based consent forms 37%).<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> Still fewer documents discuss whether to disclose incidental findings; of the ones that mention disclosure, more of them recommend disclosure than nondisclosure. The study did not review industry&#8208;sponsored research and many research sponsors might perceive any medical disclosures to research participants as possibly revealing proprietary information.</p><p>Defenders of the current role of physicians in medical research can point to informed consent documents that describe the procedures and limited protections of research participation. Arguably, research participants freely accept all the conditions of participation in clinical trials. Numerous studies, however, have demonstrated that many participants do not carefully read, comprehend, or remember the contents of informed consent documents.<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> The 2018 revisions of the Common Rule attempted to bolster informed consent by adding the requirement that researchers include &#8220;key information&#8221; in an understandable form and applying a &#8220;reasonable person&#8221; standard to determine what must be disclosed,<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> but it is unclear whether these measures have been successful<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref> and whether they have achieved the goal of &#8220;rescuing&#8221; informed consent.<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>In addition, many patients who participate in clinical research are significantly impaired by their illness, and even though they may be competent to consent, they might not completely appreciate the conflicting goals of research versus treatment. The substantial empirical research showing a deficit in knowledge transfer in the informed consent process clearly suggests that some or many research participants misunderstand important aspects of studies, including the atypical relationship between research physicians and research participants. Therefore, informed consent should not be considered a waiver by participants of all their rights and interests. Paragraph 9 of the Declaration of Helsinki states: &#8220;The responsibility for the protection of research participants must always rest with physicians or other researchers and never with the research participants, even though they have given consent.&#8221;<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">

Nevertheless, the disclosures and protections in this opinion may be even more important in research settings because individuals can experience a variety of physical and psychological harms in clinical research. By contrast, any harms from a medical examination conducted for an employer or insurance company are mostly economic, such as loss of employment or denial of insurance coverage.</p></sec><sec id="eahr60035-sec-0040"><title>BILL OF RIGHTS FOR CLINICAL RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS</title><p>One way of aligning customary research practices with the ethical obligations of physicians expressed in the codes and opinions of medical ethics

would be to revise the codes and opinions to be more realistic and expressly state that common research practices are designed to generate new knowledge and not to protect the interests of participants.<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref> In theory, this approach might make informed consent more &#8220;informed,&#8221; but it would not necessarily change the way clinical research is conducted or improve the well&#8208;being of participants. It would also dilute the aspirational goals of nonbinding codes and opinions regarding the beneficent role of physicians. Another option, explored below, is to incorporate a limited number of basic principles from the physician&#8208;patient relationship into the physician&#8208;research participant relationship.</p><p>Integration of key principles of medical ethics into clinical research can be achieved through essential disclosures and minimum standards. The Bill of Rights for Clinical Research Participants builds on the analogous responsibilities of physicians performing medical examinations for third parties described in the AMA's Ethics Opinion 1.2.6. Framing the research obligations of physicians as a Bill of Rights for Clinical Research Participants emphasizes the foundational nature of the principles and is intended to increase the awareness and understanding of them by research participants.</p><p>Other bills of rights applicable to research participants have been adopted or proposed. For example, in 1978, California enacted the Experimental Research Subject's Bill of Rights.<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref> This law, however, merely tracks rights contained in the Common Rule, such as the right to be informed about the nature of the research; the right to be informed about the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the research; and the right to informed consent.</p><p>By contrast, the Bill of Rights for Clinical Research Participants goes beyond the Common Rule and focuses on the physician&#8208;participant relationship. Three of the provisions (3, 4, and 5) are intended to supplement the informed consent process mandated by the Common Rule<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref> by reiterating required elements of informed consent at a time and in a context where they are more likely to be comprehended by participants.

Nevertheless, it would change some current practices and research sponsors, researchers, and other stakeholders could have one or more of the following five main concerns.</p><p>First is the possible disclosure of proprietary information. However, only principle 9 of the Bill of Rights (disclosure of medical information) could involve information generated by the study and disclosures need not include proprietary information.</p><p>Second is that certain individual disclosures of health information (principles 6, 7, 8, and 9) will undermine the scientific integrity of the study by unblinding the identity of individual participants. Nevertheless, it is possible to maintain blinding of the study by separating medical team member responsibilities, such as assigning disclosure obligations to investigators who are not responsible for analyzing data.</p><p>Third is that physician disclosures would be time consuming. Principles 3, 4, 5, and 9 do not require direct physician involvement, and other personnel including research coordinators and nurses can be assigned to make these disclosures. The physician's involvement in satisfying the other principles should not take an inordinate amount of time. Furthermore, similar disclosures by physicians are currently required by medical ethics provisions applicable to medical assessments by third parties, such as examinations for life insurance coverage. Participants in clinical research are not merely examined but often have a degree of risk and discomfort and therefore deserve an appropriate level of medical disclosures. Of related concern, the modest changes associated with the Bill of Rights are unlikely to be financially burdensome on research sponsors, especially considering the substantial costs of clinical research.</p><p>Fourth is that if researchers assume a duty, for instance to disclose incidental findings, the failure to satisfy the duty could lead to legal liability. Yet, it is possible that there already could be liability for nondisclosure of incidental findings even without a physician&#8208;patient relationship and despite inclusion of a disclaimer in an informed consent document.<xref rid="eahr60035-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>32</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>Fifth is the concern that compensation for research&#8208;related injuries should not be available for patients whose existing medical condition worsened regardless of the research. However, as with any claim for medical injury, the claimant would need to prove a causal relationship between the clinical trial and the asserted injury, such as where the harm was of a different body part or organ system, or where similar adverse events occurred in other research participants.</p></sec><sec id="eahr60035-sec-0160"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Many of the ethical problems associated with physicians engaging in clinical research involve a lack of transparency, fidelity, and beneficence&#8212;hallmarks of the physician&#8208;patient relationship. Notwithstanding the absence of a traditional physician&#8208;patient relationship and recognizing the important differences between medical care and research, physicians still have ethical obligations to research participants with whom they interact in a professional capacity. The essential obligation is to conduct research in a reasonable manner consistent with promoting transparency and protecting the well&#8208;being of research participants.</p><p>The Bill of Rights for Clinical Research Participants incorporates some of the important ethics elements of the physician&#8208;patient relationship into research settings through a series of disclosures and minimum standards of conduct. Several of these principles have been adopted by the AMA's ethics opinions addressing other nontraditional relationships, including employer&#8208;retained physicians and independent medical examiners. The principles of the Bill of Rights for Clinical Research Participants can be adopted with a minimum amount of effort and while maintaining the scientific integrity of the study.

Moreover, by establishing a robust, trusting, and meaningful relationship between research physicians and research participants, the Bill of Rights for Clinical Research Participants has the potential to advance scientific discovery by increasing the willingness of physicians and potential research participants to take part in important studies.</p><p>Some research sponsors and medical institutions already have adopted these principles through internally developed rules or IRB policies.
