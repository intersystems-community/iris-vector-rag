The standard treatment of testicular rupture remains early exploration and debridement to attempt testicular salvage [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The surgical technique involves evacuation of any hematoma, debridement of the extruded seminiferous tubules, and primary closure of the tunica albuginea [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, for testicular rupture with tunica albuginea defect, it is difficult to close the tunica albuginea in the early stage, and using a pedicled tunica vaginalis may be a better choice. In this paper, we report two cases of testicular rupture using the tunica vaginalis to repair tunica albuginea defects. This case serves as a reminder for urologists to reflect on such diagnostic challenges to avoid similar errors in the future. This case report has been reported according to the revised SCARE guidelines, 2025 [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Cases presentation</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Case 1</title><p id="p0025">A 13-year-old boy was hit while playing with his playmate 4&#160;days ago, causing swelling, pain, and discomfort in his right scrotum. Due to the unsatisfactory conservative treatment effect of self-oral anti-inflammatory drugs, the patient visited our hospital. Ultrasound examination showed right testicular and epididymal contusion and fissure. After admission, emergency surgery was performed. During the operation, two tunica albuginea ruptures and defects were observed in the right testicle, accompanied by a small amount of testicular necrotic tissue. Most of the testicular tissue was normal. After cleaning the necrotic testicular tissue, tunica vaginalis around the rupture site were selected to repair the tunica albuginea defect. The patient's scrotum showed no signs of infection or necrosis after surgery. B-ultrasound, MR, and hormone levels were rechecked at 6 and 12&#160;months after surgery, respectively. The re-examination results all indicated that the volume of the right testicle was about 35 * 23&#160;mm, with uneven echoes and richer blood flow signals compared to the contralateral side (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

He sought medical attention at a local hospital and underwent pelvic CT, which revealed left testicular trauma. He was then transferred to our hospital for emergency surgery. During the operation, it was found that the left testicular tunica albuginea was severely ruptured, with nearly one-third of the testicular parenchyma extruded. After cleaning the blood swelling and trimming the necrotic testicular tissue, a pedicled tunica vaginalis was cut around the rupture site and sutured to the remaining end of the white membrane with 4&#8211;0 absorbable sutures to maintain a certain tension as much as possible. There was no significant necrosis or infection in the left scrotum of the postoperative patient. Follow up examinations at 6 and 12&#160;months after surgery showed that the left testicle was approximately 37 * 20&#160;mm, with uneven testicular echoes and richer blood flow signals on the left side compared to the contralateral side (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

The surgeries were performed by experienced chief physicians. These two patients have severe testicular rupture and a large area of tunica albuginea defect, which cannot be primary closured. If the testicular tissue is removed and sutured directly, it may take away the viable testicular tissue and cause compartment syndrome, leading to testicular atrophy. After sufficient communication and agreement from the parents of the patient, we used the technique of pedicled testicular sheath to complete the surgery. During the operation, the tunica vaginalis was opened on the opposite side of the ruptured testicle to reduce the tension of the tunica vaginalis graft and ensure the width of the root of the graft, thereby better protecting the blood supply of the tunica vaginalis. There were no surgical complications observed during or after the operation in the pediatric patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0040">Rupture of the tunica albuginea exposes the seminiferous tubules which puts at stake prognosis for future fertility [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Severe testicular injury could affect the fertility and contribute to hypogonadism, which affects social confidence [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Testicular rupture with a defect in the tunica albuginea is considered difficult to place the protruding testicular tissue inside the tunica albuginea, even if the hematoma is cleared. Sacrificing viable seminiferous tubules may make primary closure possible, however, this primary closure can lead to interruption of blood flow and testicular necrosis [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, choosing to use testicular tunica vaginalis as an alternative tissue for repair and reconstruction is worth exploring and experimenting with.</p><p id="p0045">As early as 1992, DEEPAK et al. first reported the use of the tunica vaginalis to solve the problem of tunica albuginea defects caused by testicular rupture [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. And this technique was later reported in multiple studies, with a total of 11 patients using this method to treat testicular rupture, including some patients with penetrating testicular injury [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>]. In addition, studies have shown that free grafts can be used to cover tunica albuginea defects. The success of free grafts depends on the blood flow of the graft bed, and recanalization is essential [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) has been used for testicular capsule reconstruction after testicular trauma, but due to the high rate of graft infection, its effectiveness is poor, and in severe cases, the testicle needs to be removed [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The technology provided in this study does not require any special equipment or additional costs, avoids debridement of viable testicular tissue, and has an extremely low incidence of complications.</p><p id="p0050">The surgery of using testicular tunica vaginalis to replace tunica albuginea defects requires certain skills and experience. Firstly, when preparing to cut the tunica vaginalis, we need to anticipate the approximate location of the testicular rupture as much as possible, and open the tunica vaginalis on the opposite side of the rupture. This can reserve more pedunculated tunica vaginalis to replace the potentially missing tunica albuginea, and suture the tunica vaginalis with the residual end of the ruptured tunica albuginea; In addition, if choosing to use the tunica vaginalis for repair, it is necessary to ensure the blood supply of the tunica vaginalis, avoid tunica vaginalis necrosis, cause hydrocele in the sheath cavity, wound leakage or rupture, and more worrying, it may lead to the formation of anti-sperm antibody, which in turn may pose a risk of infertility. Finally, when using tunica vaginalis repair, it is necessary to design the tunica vaginalis to be used based on the area of tunica albuginea defects after cleaning the necrotic testicular tissue, and to ensure that the tunica vaginalis flap has a certain tension after suturing, so as to limit the ruptured testicular tissue and promote healing.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0055">For testicular rupture with obvious tunica albuginea defects, using the tunica vaginalis as a repair substitute can minimize the loss of live testicular tissue and reduce the risk of fertility and hormonal dysfunction. Preserving endocrine function and testicular volume is an important outcome of pediatric urology, and this technique can help us better achieve this goal.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Consent</title><p id="p0060">Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of minors for publication of this case report and accompanying images.
