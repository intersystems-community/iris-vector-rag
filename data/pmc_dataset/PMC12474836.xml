Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulated palmitoylation is implicated in various cancers, including BLCA, by affecting oncogenic signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, a comprehensive prediction model for palmitoylated proteins specifically in BLCA, is still lacking.</p><p id="Par7">To address this gap, we aim to develop a predictive model for palmitoylation in BLCA, using machine learning and bioinformatics approaches. By integrating high-throughput sequencing data and computational analysis, our model seeks to identify potential palmitoylated proteins associated with tumor progression and therapeutic resistance.

MR utilizes genetic variants as instrumental variables to infer causality between an exposure and an outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this study, we employ single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with gene expression levels (expression quantitative trait loci, eQTLs) and DNA methylation levels (methylation quantitative trait loci, mQTLs) as instrumental variables to assess the impact of GRK5 on BLCA development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

The sensitivity-analysis chart illustrated the correlation between the SNP sites of GRK5 and the outcome of BLCA, rs10886430, rs10886468, rs11198846, rs11199045, rs12221409 and rs4751709 promoted the happening of the outcome of BLCA, and rs10886445, rs117052055, rs117713786, rs4752263, rs57957161, rs61876592, rs74347407, rs75767068, rs7900201 and rs80273224 played inhibitory roles, and the details were shown in Supplementary Table S5. The majority of these SNPs exhibit odds ratios (ORs) less than 1, suggesting a potential association with decreased expression of GRK5. The scatter plot displays the distribution of SNP effects on the exposure (x-axis) and outcome (y-axis), with fitted regression lines representing the causal estimates obtained from various MR methods, including Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and Weighted Median, and consistency across methods (IVW and MR-Egger) supports the robustness of the causal inference.

Therefore, what underlying mechanisms suppress the expression of SNP loci within GRK5, thereby contributing to its pro-tumorigenic effect?</p><p id="Par51">Through MR analysis of GRK5 methylation patterns, we identified several SNP sites that are significantly associated with clinical outcomes in BLCA (Supplementary Table S6). As the details of the analyses were shown in Supplementary Figures S5-8, sensitivity analyses revealed no signs of heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy, as indicated by Cochran&#8217;s Q test and MR-Egger regression. Additionally, the MR-PRESSO analysis identified no outliers, and the leave-one-out analysis demonstrated consistent results, reinforcing the robustness and reliability of our Mendelian randomization findings.

The SNPS associated with the MR Effect of DNA methylation sites and BLCA were shown in Supplementary Table S7. We also found that the expression level of GRK5 is higher in the low methylation group in TCGA-BLCA samples (Supplementary Figure S9), this result also partly supported the conclusion that GRK5 is highly expressed in bladder cancer due to the inhibition of DNA methylation and is positively related to the poor prognosis of patients. To further evaluate the mediating role of GRK5 expression in the effect of DNA methylation on the outcome, we utilized genes associated with GRK5 expression to evaluate the causal role of GRK5 as a mediator in the risk of BLCA(pathway b, &#946;&#8322;). By integrating the findings from both steps, we derived the total effect (&#946;_all), the mediation effect (&#946;&#8321;&#8322;), and the direct effect (&#946;_dir). The proportion of the mediation effect is detailed in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. Notably, cg09337049 methylation influenced BLCA risk partly through its suppressive effect on GRK5 expression. The estimated mediation effect accounted for approximately 36.99% of the total association between cg09337049 methylation and BLCA risk, suggesting a potential epigenetic mechanism linking this CpG site to tumor development. Based on the above results, a mediation model was further constructed to visualize the causal pathway from cg09337049 methylation to BLCA risk through GRK5 expression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">11</xref>g). Specifically, cg09337049 methylation negatively regulated GRK5 expression (&#946;&#8321; = -0.22265), while reduced GRK5 expression was associated with decreased BLCA risk (&#946;&#8322; = -0.23151). The total effect of cg09337049 methylation on BLCA risk (&#946;_all) was 0.139355. The indirect effect mediated by GRK5 (&#946;&#8321;&#8322;) was 0.05154, accounting for 36.96% of the total effect. These results provide strong evidence that GRK5 expression partially mediates the relationship between DNA methylation at cg09337049 and BLCA development, revealing an important epigenetic regulatory axis.

Elucidating the complex biological mechanisms underlying BLCA pathogenesis, alongside the development of robust clinical prognostic models, constitutes a critical focus in contemporary oncological research. These advancements are pivotal for guiding personalized therapeutic strategies and improving clinical outcomes in BLCA patients. As a critical and reversible lipid modification, protein palmitoylation plays a key role in regulating protein localization, stability, and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that aberrant palmitoylation is closely associated with the initiation and progression of various cancers and may influence tumor cell invasiveness, immune evasion, and drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The relationship between palmitoylation and BLCA has emerged as an important area of investigation, with growing evidence revealing complex and biologically significant interactions between them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For example, through in vitro and xenograft experiments, studies have shown that altering the expression of PRGs such as ZDHHC9 can inhibit tumor proliferation and enhance chemotherapy sensitivity in BLCA cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Emerging bioinformatics analyses have also revealed dynamic expression patterns of palmitoylation regulators, like ZDHHC7/20/21, across multiple cancer types, suggesting potential links to tumor progression and immune microenvironment modulation in BLCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Despite this, the understanding of PRGs&#8217; role in BLCA metastasis and patient prognosis is still at an early stage. To date, predictive models using PRG signatures for BLCA prognosis remain rare and underexplored in clinical applications.</p><p id="Par54">Currently, extensive research has explored the associations between PRGs and cancer prognosis. However, the related predictive models for clinical outcomes is still lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In this research, we developed a prognostic model incorporating 13 palmitoylation-related genes (PRGs)&#8212;including GRK5, AHNAK, GSDMB, P4HB, ABCC9, CNTN1, NEFL, TEAD4, MAP1B, TMTC1, OTX2, SERPINF1, and LIME1&#8212;to estimate the OS of patients with BLCA. The model effectively distinguished patients with different prognoses, with those classified in the high-risk group showing markedly worse survival outcomes. The model&#8217;s predictive ability was demonstrated by AUC values greater than 0.7 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS in the TCGA training cohort, underscoring its robust accuracy. The robustness of this finding was further supported by consistent results in both internal and external validation sets. To date, PRG signatures have only been explored in the context of breast cancer, with Taolan et al. developing a model capable of predicting therapeutic responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the present study, we report the first PRG-based prognostic model specifically tailored for bladder cancer.

Furthermore, we integrated the PRG-derived risk score with key clinical parameters to construct a nomogram, which further substantiates the predictive accuracy and clinical applicability of the model.</p><p id="Par55">Accumulating evidence indicates that TEAD4 is significantly upregulated in BLCA, its high expression is closely associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. TEAD4 mediates BLCA metastasis through regulating EMT via PI3K/AKT pathway. These findings suggest that TEAD4 may serve as a critical contributor to the pathogenesis and progression of BLCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similarly, the upregulation of GSDMB was found to promote the proliferation and invasive capabilities of BLCA cells. Mechanistically, GSDMB forms a complex with USP24, which activates the STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, prevents the degradation of GSDMB, thereby sustaining its oncogenic functions in BLCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In another study, analysis of MAP1B protein expression in BLCA patients receiving PD-1 inhibitor immunotherapy revealed that MAP1B is predominantly localized in the tumor stroma rather than in tumor cells. This finding supports its role as a key marker gene for myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts. Moreover, the study suggests that BLCA patients with high MAP1B expression tend to exhibit a poor response to PD-1 inhibitor-based immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

RB1 mutations have been shown to drive smoking-associated bladder tumorigenesis by suppressing the cytochrome P450 pathway and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, RB1 inhibits the expression of DNA repair genes by forming a complex with HDAC1 and TEAD4, providing a theoretical basis for overcoming chemotherapy resistance in advanced rectal cancer. CDK4/6 inhibitors can enhance the efficacy of oxaliplatin by suppressing RB1 phosphorylation, thereby promoting the formation of the RB1/TEAD4/HDAC1 complex, inhibiting DNA repair gene expression, and increasing DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Nevertheless, further research is warranted to elucidate the association between the high RB1 mutation rate and palmitoylated proteins in bladder cancer.</p><p id="Par57">In this study, the outcomes of the functional enrichment analysis revealed that PRGs were primarily associated with the progression of metabolism involved in biological processes such as muscle system process, muscle contraction, cardiac process, and myofibril organization. These findings suggest that the PRG model may be not only linked to intrinsic tumor characteristics but also involved in modulating muscle tissue function within the tumor microenvironment, thereby influencing tumor invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The KEGG pathways are closely associated with cellular contractility, signal transduction, and stress responses, implying that PRGs may regulate bladder cancer cell motility, invasion, and chemoresistance through these biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. GSEA analysis further supported these observations. In the high-risk group, enrichment was observed in pathways related to myocardial contraction, muscle system processes, and cytoskeletal remodeling, suggesting enhanced motility and invasive capacity of tumor cells in high-risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In contrast, the low-risk group showed enrichment in lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and reactive oxygen species metabolic processes, indicating a PRG metabolic-stable phenotype potentially associated with lower invasiveness and better prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">In order to further explore the hub gene affecting the prognosis of BLCA, we employed two-sample MR, summary-data-based MR (SMR), and mediation analyses to investigate the causal relationship between palmitoylation-related genes and BLCA. Our findings revealed a significant link between GRK5 expression and BLCA risk, with DNA methylation acting as a mediating factor. These results offer new insights into the pathogenesis of BLCA by emphasizing the role of epigenetic regulation in neurodegenerative disorders and suggest that GRK5 may serve as a promising biomarker or therapeutic target for the early diagnosis and treatment of BLCA. Our two-sample MR and SMR analyses revealed that SNPs associated with GRK5 are negatively associated with the risk of BLCA. GRK5 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5) is a member of the GRK family, characterized by the presence of a conserved serine/threonine kinase domain that regulates signal transduction by phosphorylating activated G protein-coupled receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Although there is currently no direct evidence indicating that GRK5 undergoes palmitoylation, substantial evidence suggests that certain members of the GRK family are subject to various lipid modifications. In particular, GRK6 and GRK2 have been shown to participate in the palmitoylation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. GRK5 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several conditions: T66, as the amino acid of the cytoskeletal-membrane attachment protein moesin, participates in regulating the principal GRK5 phosphorylation, its mutation can silence the expression level of GRK5 and lead to the inhibition of tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis in prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; GRK5 upregulation was associated with poor clinical outcomes in renal cell carcinoma patients, it mainly promoted tumor cell proliferation, cell invasion, migration through increasing proportion of cells in S phase, with concomitant decrease in G1 phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; Gln41Leu A&#8201;&gt;&#8201;T and Arg304His G&#8201;&gt;&#8201;A fusion gene polymorphisms of GRK5 are vital genetic susceptibility genes to breast cacncer, manifesting as worse tumor staging and grading, and higher rates of estrogen receptor (ER) (-), progesterone receptor (PR) (-) and HER2 (-) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The above studies also supported the oncogene role of GRK5 in pan-cancers.</p><p id="Par59">Mediation analysis revealed that DNA methylation at cg09337049 downregulates the expression of SNPs of GRK5, consequently exerting an indirect effect on BLCA risk. Notably, this methylation site has not been previously documented in BLCA methylation research. DNA methylation mainly takes place in CpG promoter regions and is widely recognized as a key epigenetic mechanism leading to gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In BLCA research, DNA methylation has been shown to regulate the expression of the hub tumor-related genes and influence tumor progression and patient prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. By modulating the expression of cancer-associated genes, DNA methylation may play a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of BLCA. We observed that DNA methylation in the promoter region of GRK5 could be strongly linked to its expression and function. These methylation changes may directly impact the transcriptional activity of GRK5, thereby regulating its expression in bladder cancer cells and playing a role in the progression of BLCA. This regulatory mechanism may open up new therapeutic opportunities, such as restoring the expression of SNPs by promoting the methylation of specific CpG sites (like cg09337049) in GRK5, thereby alleviating BLCA-related changes. Furthermore, GRK5 methylation could serve as a biomarker for early diagnosis or monitoring of disease progression in BLCA. Future studies should explore its potential for detection in urine or blood as a non-invasive method for BLCA screening and personalized treatment.</p><p id="Par60">Our study has several notable strengths. First, to our knowledge, it is the first prognostic model specifically based on PRGs for BLCA, filling an important gap in the current research landscape. Second, the model demonstrated robust predictive performance across multiple datasets, including internal validation (randomly partitioned TCGA-BLCA subset) and external validation (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE32894">GSE32894</ext-link> cohort), consistently achieving favorable AUC values above 0.65. Third, a comprehensive multidimensional analysis was conducted, integrating survival prediction, clinical correlations, immune microenvironment characterization, drug sensitivity evaluation, and somatic mutation profiling, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s clinical relevance. Fourth, the study delved into mechanistic insights by identifying GRK5 as a potential hub gene and revealing the causal role of DNA methylation-mediated regulation in BLCA development through MR and mediation analysis. Finally, this research proposes a non-invasive biomarker strategy, suggesting that GRK5 methylation could potentially be detected in urine or blood for BLCA early screening and disease monitoring.</p><p id="Par61">However, several limitations were still existing. Firstly, all model construction and validation were based on public datasets, and lack prospective validation in large-scale, real-world clinical samples, which may introduce potential biases. Secondly, since the eQTL data used were derived from blood rather than bladder tissues, there may be discrepancies in tissue-specific gene regulation that limit the direct biological interpretation in bladder cancer. Although blood-derived QTLs provide valuable genetic insight, future studies should incorporate bladder tissue- or urine-specific eQTL data (e.g., from GTEx or clinical samples) for more accurate mechanistic inference. Thirdly, although this study provided bioinformatic and statistical evidence, no in vitro or in vivo experiments were conducted to directly validate the functional roles of GRK5 and other key PRGs in BLCA. Moreover, the verification of GRK5 protein expression was limited to only three pairs of BLCA samples, and further confirmation using a larger sample size is needed to draw more definitive conclusions regarding its expression pattern. Fourthly, the clinical applicability of the PRG model in guiding personalized treatment decisions remains to be further verified in prospective clinical studies. Fifthly, although the transcriptomic upregulation of immune checkpoints in high-risk patients suggests a potential T cell exhaustion phenotype, functional confirmation through flow cytometry or single-cell profiling shold be pursued in future studies to clarify the underlying immune status. Lastly, the model did not perform subgroup analyses based on molecular subtypes of BLCA, which may overlook the impact of tumor heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par62">In this study, we developed and validated a prognostic model based on PRGs for BLCA, demonstrating its robust predictive power across multiple cohorts. The model effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct survival outcomes, immune landscapes, and drug sensitivities.We further identified GRK5 as a key hub gene through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and revealed that its expression of SNPs may mediate the impact of DNA methylation on BLCA risk. Notably, the methylation site cg09337049 contributed significantly to this mediation effect.</p><p id="Par63">Overall, our findings highlight the prognostic value of PRGs and the potential regulatory role of GRK5 in BLCA progression, offering new insights into epigenetic mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
