Despite the common use of hatchery-grown subadult mussels (&lt;&#8201;40&#160;mm) for reintroduction efforts, their physical habitat requirements as well as guidance on identifying suitable release locations for different mussel species and sizes are severely lacking. We addressed this knowledge gap by deploying three-dimensional (3D)-printed subadult mussels equipped with scannable tags in a river as a proxy for hard-to-track live subadult mussels. We tracked mobilization, displacement and resettlement of 3D-printed and live freshwater mussels at five sites in the Mission Reach of the San Antonio River, Texas, USA, over two years. We found mobilization increased at higher discharges, smaller mussels mobilized at lower flows than adult mussels, site-specific geomorphic features reduced displacement distances, and boulder fields, or habitats with large stable roughness elements, resettled mussels at the highest rate. The study methods and results can directly inform freshwater mussel reintroduction efforts and river restoration project designs that include mussel habitats.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-18244-y.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Subadult</kwd><kwd>Freshwater mussels</kwd><kwd>3D-printing</kwd><kwd>Reintroduction</kwd><kwd>Mobilization</kwd><kwd>Resettlement</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Freshwater ecology</kwd><kwd>Restoration ecology</kwd><kwd>Civil engineering</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100006505</institution-id><institution>Engineer Research and Development Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionoida) are a globally diverse species that provide critical ecosystem services for rivers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, their populations have declined precipitously over the past century due to their extreme vulnerability to habitat degradation&#8212;both physical and chemical&#8212;and freshwater mussels are now among the most imperiled species in North America and worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Reintroduction of native mussels following aquatic habitat restoration is an increasingly used conservation practice to establish self-sustaining populations, with multiple federal, state, and university facilities in the U.S. now propagating freshwater mussels to support conservation efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

While reintroduction success is higher when using larger individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, the typical release size of hatchery-propagated mussels is the subadult life-stage between 20 and 40&#160;mm in length (USFW personal comm, 2022) in order to balance the cost of raising mussels with their likelihood of survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Even so, little is known about the habitat suitability requirements of the subadult life-stage, defined as the period from when a drifting juvenile settles on the river bed to when it becomes a reproducing adult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This has been attributed in part to the bias of finding larger mussels (&gt;&#8201;40&#160;mm) during visual-tactile searches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, leading to inconclusive or overreaching results related to smaller individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">As sessile benthic organisms, mussels are exposed to life-threatening risks during low and high flow events. While high flows play an important role in connecting mussels to downstream habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, they can also be a critical limitation to mussels establishing themselves within new habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, particularly during smaller life-stages. To date, studies on freshwater mussel physical habitat suitability under high flow conditions have largely focused on adult mussels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Studies have found that complex hydraulic variables, which consider direct flow measures&#8212;such as water velocity and flow depth&#8212;as well as sediment and channel characteristics, can be a reasonable proxy for adult mussel habitat suitability at high flows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, local hydraulic conditions are difficult to monitor in the field at high flows. Field studies have assessed the mussel response to a single high flow event<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and mussel persistence over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, but gaps remain in terms of assessing relative responses across multiple high flow events and have not considered the smaller life-stages. Additionally, studies often focus on assessing physical habitat conditions where mussels are observed without considering when or from where these mussels settled in their current location, both important factors when considering the entire mussel life cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Principles and techniques from sediment bedload studies can be leveraged to assess physical habitat requirements of these smaller, harder-to-track subadult mussels. Sediment bedload studies track sediment clasts with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT) drilled in them to understand how the bedload moves through river systems during storm events. These studies have estimated field-based thresholds for particle incipient motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, highlighted connections between sediment displacement distances and storm flow magnitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, and found links between tagged sediment deposition and channel morphodynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. While freshwater mussels could be idealized as pieces of sediment and many of the results of bedload tracking studies are directly applicable to subadult mussels, sediment bedload studies still only use clasts larger than 40&#160;mm due to limitations with PIT tag sizes and recapture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, leaving a knowledge gap in how smaller particles and mussels interact with the flow and bed.</p><p id="Par5">To address the critical knowledge gaps related to suitable physical habitat conditions for subadult freshwater mussels, this study employs three dimensional (3D)-printed adult and subadult freshwater mussel replicates of four different species, <italic toggle="yes">Pustulosa pustulosa</italic> (Pimpleback), <italic toggle="yes">Tritogonia verrucosa</italic> (Pistolgrip), <italic toggle="yes">Amblema plicata</italic> (Threeridge), and <italic toggle="yes">Lampsilis teres</italic> (Yellow Sandshell), equipped with PIT tags to track their mobilization, displacement and settlement through high flow events across two years. We focused on five sites within the Mission Reach of the San Antonio River (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), one of the largest urban river restoration projects in the United States, where the first-in-Texas freshwater mussel reintroduction is underway. While the Mission Reach maintains a constant baseflow, removing the threat of desiccation during low flow periods, the system is capable of creating extremely high flow events that cause high bed shear stress (SI Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Over the two-year study, we conducted repeat surveys to track the mussels (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), recorded sediment composition and bathymetry changes, and analyzed habitat types from aerial imagery and sites visits to assess suitable mussel habitat across species and sizes. We used the PIT tag data to assess what flows mobilized mussels, how far they displaced when mobilized and where they resettled relative to the habitat available downstream of their introduction sites. We compared mobilization and displacement distances between mussel species and sizes, study sites, bed sediment composition and habitat types to understand how suitable conditions change as mussels grow toward reproducing age. Finally, we released live adult mussels in conjunction with 3D-printed adult mussels to compare mobilization flows and displacement distances between replicate and live mussels.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The Mission Reach of the San Antonio River, Texas, USA with the study sites labeled.

These habitats were defined as having boulder or other large roughness elements that were exposed above the water surface during base flow or on the downstream side of bars and islands, respectively. Both of these habitats exhibit similar flow refugia features.

Printed 20&#160;mm subadult mussels exhibited lower discharge mobilization thresholds across all species compared to the printed adult mussels of the same species (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which was a similar result to sediment tracking studies looking at incipient motion thresholds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the live adult mussels had median mobilization thresholds that were significantly lower than those of the printed adult mussels (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

An unpublished flume study comparing mobilization thresholds between printed and live subadult mussels found these protective behaviors to be important for stability, especially as mussels grew in size. This discrepancy may be attributed to the deployment scheme, as live mussels were not deployed until the second release of Year 2. This meant they were not monitored through a high flow event; the maximum flow felt by this cohort was 46.2 m<sup>3</sup>/s (~&#8201;0.3-yr recurrence) as compared to the 512.5 m<sup>3</sup>/s (~&#8201;2-yr recurrence) that was experienced at the beginning of Year 2.

Resettlement numbers were highest in Main Channel habitats, while Boulder Field habitats settled mussels from within the same habitat most frequently, meaning mussels that mobilized within a Boulder Field often also resettled within the same habitat.

Since the restoration was completed, fish, birds and insects have recolonized the river<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. However, native freshwater mussel populations have not recovered in the expected numbers, despite long term monitoring confirming that the water quality is consistently adequate to support mussels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, minor populations of mussels being present in the unconnected relic side arms of the historic channel (San Antonio River Authority, unpublished data) and recent studies confirming the presence of host fish species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">The San Antonio River Authority (SARA) is planning to use hatchery-propagated mussels to reintroduce four species of freshwater mussels to the Mission Reach that are currently found in downstream reaches of the San Antonio River: <italic toggle="yes">Pustulosa pustulosa</italic> (Pimpleback), <italic toggle="yes">Tritogonia verrucosa</italic> (Pistolgrip), <italic toggle="yes">Amblema plicata</italic> (Threeridge), and <italic toggle="yes">Lampsilis teres</italic> (Yellow Sandshell). Five potential reintroduction sites were selected for this study based on general channel morphology, sediment type, and accessibility (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The sites were between 50 and 250&#160;m in length and extended from one of the concrete riffle structures at the upstream end of the site to the next downstream riffle structure or permanent boundary marker. The bed composition of these sites is highly variable, ranging from clay bedrock to fine sand to large cobble and boulders, with gravels and cobbles being the most common.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Experimental design</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Mussel 3D-printing</title><p id="Par27">The 3D-printing process for creating subadult mussel replicates included the following key steps. First, fully-intact empty adult mussel shells of the four target species obtained from Texas Parks and Wildlife Division (TPWD) were scanned (NextEngine 3D Scanner, model 2020i) to create 3D renderings (Blender ver. 2.92.0; The Blender Foundation). A shell thickness of 0.1 cm was added to the rendering to provide structural support and ensure no holes would form during printing. Next, mussel mass was determined for the target printing lengths of 20&#160;mm and adult, or the mean size of the live mussels measured, using species-specific power functions created using measurements from known mussel beds in a downstream reach of the San Antonio River (SI Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Mussels then were printed in high-visibility colors to aid in tracking efforts and final recovery following the field study. Next, the mussel shells were outfitted with an HDX PIT tag (ORFID, Portland, OR, USA), with the 20&#160;mm and adult sizes having 12&#160;mm and 32&#160;mm tags, respectively. Finally, lead weights and silicone filled the remaining shell space to reach the correct mass and the shell halves were sealed closed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par28">Field data collection related to mussel mobilization, displacement and resettlement took place over the summers of 2022 and 2023 (SI Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Data from 2022 were used to inform the deployment experimental design in 2023.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Mussel deployment and tracking</title><p id="Par29">Printed mussels were deployed and tracked over the course of two field seasons, where the second-year deployment scheme was informed by the first-year results. In Year 1, 600 20&#160;mm printed mussels were deployed across three field sites (S1, S3 and S5 in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Each of the four target species were equally represented and the mussels were placed in the corners of a layout grid to ensure the mussels were far enough apart to capture all the tags during a rescanning event (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This grid also kept each deployment group in similar flow and sediment conditions. There were six transects at each site with six deployment locations along each transect plus seven deployment locations along each margin, independent of the transects (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The transect locations were selected in collaboration with SARA to span a wide range of sediment types, geomorphic features and distances from an upstream concrete riffle structure. See Supplemental Information Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for all site deployment layouts. Each mussel was partially embedded in the substrate and oriented in the direction of flow at deployment to mimic a live mussel at the surface of the riverbed (personal comm., Clint Robertson, TPWD). Thirty-six printed adult mussels of each species (see SI Table 5 for sizes) were added to this deployment scheme part of the way through Year 1 along two transects within each site. These mussels were embedded around the outside of the 20mm mussel deployment grid to reduce tag interference.</p><p id="Par30">The Year 2 deployment scheme prioritized areas that exhibited high stability within the three Year 1 study sites, as well as added two additional potential reintroduction sites. In Year 2 both sizes (20mm and adult) of each of the four target species were initially deployed in March 2023 (SI Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), and spread across an area of approximately 1&#160;m x 1&#160;m to reduce tag interference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. There were 2&#8211;5 deployment locations per study site (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; SI Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A secondary deployment occurred at all five sites in July of 2023 that included both 3D-printed adult mussels and live adult mussels (SI Table 5). This release only included <italic toggle="yes">L. teres</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">A. plicata</italic>, as these were the only readily available live adult mussels. The live adult mussels were sourced from beds in the Lower San Antonio River Basin. They were transported in buckets to the study area and each mussel had a 23&#160;mm ORFID tag attached to the outside of the shell near the umbo using Loctite glue (Loctite, Connecticut, USA). The pairs of printed and live mussels were embedded approximately 0.5m apart from each other within the selected deployment area.</p><p id="Par31">Rescan visits were triggered by either high flow events or duration elapsed without a significant flow event based on discharge readings from the USGS gage 08178565 for the San Antonio River at Loop 410 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; SI Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). During each rescan visit, the entire wadable area within a study site was scanned using an Oregon RFID backpack scanner equipped with a GPS to inform PIT tag scan locations. Starting at the downstream end of a site, sweeping motions with the scanning wand were made while moving perpendicular to flow, moving upstream until the entire wadable area of the study site was covered. Additional time was spent scanning deployment areas, as the higher density of tags in these areas made missed or covered tags more likely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. An asynchronous tag scanning test within a replicated deployment area showed closely arranged tags were more difficult to rescan than buried tags, especially when a smaller tag was near a larger tag (SI Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). To address this, tags pinged by the backpack scanner were read in real-time on a Bluetooth tablet and checked off from a list to allow more thorough and precise scanning efforts in the higher tag density areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Physical habitat measurements</title><p id="Par32">Sediment samples and bathymetry measurements were taken at each mussel deployment location and habitat types were determined from site visits and aerial imagery. Sediment samples were taken in both years of the study at all deployment locations except for the margin sites in Year 1. The margin sites were associated with the closest transect deployment location. Samples were excavated from the center of the deployment site and included sediments up to 5&#160;cm into the bed to account for embedment depth of the various mussel lengths. These samples were air dried to remove standing water and then put in a drying oven for 24 h at 100&#160;&#176;C. A sediment gradation was determined with each sample using sieves sized: 64, 31.5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5&#160;mm.</p><p id="Par33">Bathymetry was surveyed at all mussel deployment transects in Year 1 and at selected locations in Year 2 based on deployment locations and known areas of channel bed changes (SI Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In Year 1, a Trimble TDC150 (cm accuracy model) with RTK network correction (Trimble Inc, Colorado, USA) was used for all data collection. In Year 2, the Trimble unit was used to establish a permanent benchmark and to establish pin locations at the ends of each cross section. The transects were collected using level, stadia rod and tape due to extreme vegetation cover creating high vertical uncertainty in the Trimble points. Elevations were taken every 0.5-1&#160;m along each transect, depending on the transect length.</p><p id="Par34">Habitat types were manually delineated through a combination of site visits, site photos and aerial imagery from Google Earth Pro (Google, California, USA) and Nearmap (Nearmap, Utah, USA). The entire wetted channel at baseflow was classified into five habitat categories following Randklev et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>; SI Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). To classify a site, first bank lines were delineated, then Bank Habitat was considered to be 1 m into the channel from each bank line. Front of Point Bar and Back of Point Bar included the upstream and downstream ends of instream bars and islands, respectively. Boulder Field included all areas where large roughness elements protruded above the water surface at baseflow and could be seen on aerial imagery. Finally, Main Channel included all other habitat types, such as runs and pools. SI Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> shows a marked up aerial image for each of the five study sites to show how the habitats were delineated for reproducibility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Mark-recapture data preprocessing</title><p id="Par35">The protocols for processing mussel mark-recapture data prior to calculating discharge mobilization thresholds and displacement distances are detailed below. Mussels that were never scanned during the entire field season were removed from the dataset. Raw scanner data from each rescan visit was reduced to one point per mussel by averaging all scan coordinates, then the distance between the deployment location and the scanned location was calculated. Mussels with mobilization distances less than 2 m were considered stable, or still in their deployment position, and any displacement beyond 2 m was considered mobilized. This distance was based on the potential offset between the scanning wand and the backpack GPS unit, as well as the accuracy of the backpack GPS unit. Only initial mobilizations, displacement distances and resettlement locations were considered for all analyses due to successive displacements having an undeterminable influence of the unknown mussel orientation within the bed.</p><p id="Par36">Some additional assumptions were made to simplify the dataset based on scan timing and locations. First, if a mussel was not scanned during a rescan visit but was scanned during a future visit in its deployment location, then for all previous scan trips it was assumed that mussel was stable and in its original position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Second, if a mussel that was marked as displaced but a future scan found it within 2 m of the deployment location, this stable reading overrode the previous displacement and the previous displacement point was dropped from the dataset. Third, due to scanner error (i.e. loss of GPS accuracy) or the position of the backpack relative to the mussel, there were times the mussel&#8217;s displacement location was upstream of the deployment location. These upstream displacements were removed from the dataset. Finally, if a mussel was not scanned after a large flow event but was documented being mobilized during a subsequent smaller flow event, the initial mobilization was allocated to the larger previous event, as it is most likely the mussel was displaced during the larger event, but due to burial or tag interference, the mussel was not scanned until a later visit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discharge mobilization rates</title><p id="Par37">To understand how high flow events influenced mobilization, we calculated mobilization rates, or the number of mussels mobilized during a given scan visit compared to those that had not yet been mobilized (SI Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Mobilization rates were determined for each rescan visit and plotted against the peak flow rate between rescan trips (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Mobilization rates were also determined for each mussel species and size (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which were a cumulative rate of mobilization across all rescan visits for each mussel type.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discharge mobilization thresholds</title><p id="Par38">Mobilization thresholds were evaluated as the maximum flow rate that occurred between when the mobilization was recorded and the previous field visit for each individual mussel. The discharge mobilization thresholds were grouped by species and size (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and compared across habitat types, study sites and within species and size groups. A low mobilization threshold meant mussels were mobilized from their initial position at a lower flow rate and infers higher site instability for that mussel species and size than mussels with higher mobilization thresholds. Additionally, we compared the deployment location sediment compositions (D50) and the habitat types between mussels that were stable throughout their respective deployment period and those that were mobilized, considering all mussels sizes and species (SI Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Displacement distance and resettlement</title><p id="Par39">Displacement distances were compared to the maximum flow rate that occurred between the last stable scan and the scan after displacement (SI Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). These distances were compared between sizes, species, habitat types and study sites. We also determined the habitat types of each mussel resettlement location following their initial mobilization and calculated resettlement rates within each habitat type. Additionally, the habitat type in which resettlement occurred was compared to the overall habitat type availability downstream of each deployment area following a modified forage ratio approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. While the original intention for this equation was to define an organism&#8217;s preference for a certain type of prey, here it was used to calculate the preference of resettlement based on habitat types. For use with drift-prone aquatic species, such as mussels mobilized from the bed during a high flow event, the forage ratio was defined as the percent of mussels resettled into each habitat type relative to the percent of available area of each habitat type perpendicular to and downstream of each deployment zone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par40">The non-parametric Mann&#8211;Whitney U and Kruskal&#8211;Wallis H tests (with a post-hoc Dunn&#8217;s test using a Bonferroni correction) with an alpha of 0.05 were used to assess the significance the results for each study aim.
