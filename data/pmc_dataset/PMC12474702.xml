Hence, the selection of highly tolerant endogenous strains from produced water is crucial to designing successful bioremediation. However, the employed isolation and screening approaches are, in general, long. Integrative and rapid approaches based on microbiological and molecular techniques are now required due to the frequent fluctuation of the composition of the produced water. Here, enrichment cultures at high toxicity followed by protein profiling using MALDI-TOF MS were shown to be efficient in clustering the endogenous hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and help select the potential candidates. Several bacterial strains (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;18) were isolated from produced water sampled from Qatar&#8217;s North Field natural gas production. Fourteen strains were identified as <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus cereus</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;14), and one as <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus hominis</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;1) using MALDI-TOF MS.

The strains were further differentiated based on their protein profiles using MALDI-TOF MS and multivariate statistical analyses. Multivariate analyses (composite correlation index, principal component analysis, and dendrogram) demonstrated substantial diversity among the isolates, highlighting their potential as robust candidates for bioremediation and produced water treatment.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10529-025-03641-0.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria</kwd><kwd>Produced water</kwd><kwd>Bacterial diversity</kwd><kwd>MALDI-TOF MS</kwd><kwd>Enrichment cultures</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Qatar University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding provided by the Qatar National Library.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature B.V. 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">One of the inevitable byproducts of oil wells is produced water, generated during the extraction process (Fakhru&#8217;l-Razi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>). It is frequently composed of complex mixtures of heavy metals, salts, hydrocarbons, and other pollutants that can harm both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems if left untreated. The main oil components that may be present in produced water are light and heavy hydrocarbons, aromatics, asphaltenes, and hydrogen sulfides (Costa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>). Consequently, the remediation of the produced water requires processes such as separation, dehydration, and chemical treatment to remove hydrocarbons and reduce environmental impacts (Igunnu and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Jepsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). The advantage of bioremediation, which uses microorganisms, is the breakdown of hydrocarbons as a viable and sustainable process to treat produced water (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2024</xref>). In fact, some bacteria have the capacity to break down hydrocarbons into less hazardous and simpler compounds, which helps clean up contaminated areas (Ezennubia and Vilc&#225;ez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2023</xref>). However, high salinity, fluctuations of hydrocarbon composition and mixtures, temperature, and inorganic components characterize produced waters (Ghosh and Chakraborty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2019</xref>). The occurrence and the capacity of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in produced water are highly affected by these conditions.</p><p id="Par3">The microbial communities that may exist in produced water are characterized by their adaptation to such harsh conditions, which can lead to diversity of bacterial strains and degrading metabolic mechanisms. Application of non-native bacterial strains to remediate produced water leads to failure, in general (Christova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019</xref>). Indeed, native bacterial populations may develop symbiotic and competitive interactions, contributing to the overall bioactivity of hydrocarbon degradation (Cabrera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2022</xref>). However, this type of community requires stable water composition to be sustained, which is not ensured during the treatment process (Olowomofe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>). Some of the native bacteria may be more active than others within these populations. They should exhibit a higher tolerance to toxicity and composition fluctuations and more suitable metabolic activities even at high hydrocarbon concentrations (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2021</xref>). Isolation and selection of these native hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial strains is crucial to enhancing the effectiveness of any approach of bacterial bioremediation of produced water (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2018</xref>). Therefore, studying these populations of bacteria and their diversity is essential to simplify the approach of selection of candidates to enhance bioremediation for better effectiveness and rapidness. Cutting-edge methods like next-generation genomic sequencing and recent developments in microbiology (Bianconi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2023</xref>) have made it possible to identify and characterize a wide variety of bacteria that break down hydrocarbons, some of which have special metabolic properties. These advancements allowed the selection and optimization of bacterial strains at special growth conditions. However, a more ecological and responsive approach to the study of the diversity of these bacteria is now necessary to demonstrate the diversity at the level of the protein content. Indeed, the consequence of the adaptation of each bacterial strain is translated into an adapted protein content, qualitatively and quantitatively, as a result of the expression of different genes or expression levels. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) method is a mass spectrometry technique used to identify and analyze bacteria by measuring the mass profiles of biomolecules, primarily proteins, present in the cells. The idea behind this technique is to ionize biological molecules using a laser that deposits energy in a matrix, allowing molecules to be ionized without significant fragmentation (Martina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>). These ions are then analyzed using a mass spectrometer based on their time of flight (TOF), resulting in a distinct picture profile that represents various biomolecules. MALDI-TOF MS is a simple method to generate a mass protein profile for each strain, thereby simplifying the analysis of similarities and differences compared to other isolates (Santos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2016</xref>). It is well established for application in environmental microbiology (Martina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>; Santos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2016</xref>). Multivariate statistical tools such as principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering (dendrogram), and composite correlation index (CCI) are powerful tools for interpreting complex protein fingerprints of microbes typically obtained through MALDI-TOF MS. The coupling of these techniques with MALDI-TOF MS enables discrimination of isolates at the genus, species, and strain levels and also allow diversity assessments across datasets (Pascale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2024</xref>; Koster, and Brul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>). The use of these tools can streamline the characterization of environmental bacteria in a fast and cost-effective manner through facilitating intuitive visualization of similarity patterns and enabling dereplication (Ashfaq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">In this study, the occurrence and diversity of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in produced water from Qatari gas wells are studied for the first time using MALDI-TOF MS. The main objective is to demonstrate the high diversity of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in produced water through multivariate statistical analyses and to guide the selection of representative strains of categories of the isolated native hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria for bioremediation. As a first step, the strains are isolated by a strategy based on enrichment cultures during which high toxicity pressure is applied using high concentrations of diesel hydrocarbons. The findings propose a rapid and efficient approach to selecting the appropriate strains for successful bioremediation approaches and reducing failures due to the limited adaptability of the hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria used. This approach will be useful in the screening approaches of isolates for the bioremediation of produced water by selecting representatives of the differentiated categories.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Samples collection</title><p id="Par5">A regular sampling procedure was followed to guarantee the integrity and representativeness of the produced water samples from Qatar&#8217;s North Field natural gas production. Sterile and clean glass sample containers, free of inorganic and organic pollutants, were used. Before sample collection, the sampling line was flushed to get rid of any debris or standing water. The generated water was collected straight into the ready-made containers using an automatic sampler. To avoid losing volatile components, the sample was collected with as little exposure to air as possible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Isolation of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria by enrichment cultures</title><p id="Par6">The hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were isolated from the produced water by an enrichment culture procedure, using the mineral salt medium (MSM) as described by Al-Kaabi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>) with modifications. A mixture of 12&#160;mL of sterile MSM was mixed aseptically with 3&#160;mL of produced water and incubated at 30&#160;&#176;C for 3 d. Then, 3&#160;mL were used to inoculate 16&#160;mL MSM supplemented with 1&#160;mL diesel. The 5% (v/v) diesel corresponds to 37.5&#160;g/L diesel hydrocarbons. The diesel (&#961;&#8201;=&#8201;0.750&#160;kg/L), used in this study, was kindly provided by QE oil refinery Unit (UmSaeed, Qatar). After three successive cultures, 100 &#181;L were spread on MSM solid plates coated with 100 &#181;L diesel. The growing colonies were separately picked up in LB plates, then purified by five successive subculturing. The strains that were able to grow on solid MSM plates coated with oil within 48&#160;h were considered in this study. The purified isolates were preserved at &#8722; 20&#160;&#176;C in LB supplemented with 30% glycerol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Identification of the hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial isolates using MALDI-TOF MS</title><p id="Par7">The ethanol/formic acid extraction method was used as recommended by the manufacturer and widely reported in the literature (Ashfaq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>). In the first step, a loop full of bacterial cells from an overnight-grown culture in MSM-oil solid medium was suspended in 300 &#181;L of autoclaved distilled water. 900 &#181;L of ethanol was then added to it, followed by thorough mixing and then centrifugation at 13,000&#160;rpm for 2&#160;min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was again re-suspended in the mixture of formic acid (70%) and acetonitrile (100%) at a 1:1 (v/v). After centrifugation (13,000&#160;rpm, 2&#160;min), the supernatant was then collected, as extracted bacterial proteins were used for the identification step. The identification was carried out using a MALDI-TOF MS instrument (Model: microflex LT/SH from Bruker Daltonics, Germany). The extracted bacterial proteins (1 &#181;L) were first deposited on the MALDI biotarget plate. For each strain, two technical replicates were used. After air drying, the deposited proteins were overlaid with &#945;-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix for crystallization. Once dried, the identification process was initiated by loading the biotarget plate into the machine and after labelling each spot in Biotyper Real Time Classification software. A log scale with a score ranging from 0 to 3 was used to represent the profile matching. The highest score obtained for each strain was reported. According to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions, the value was interpreted as follows: a score of 2.3&#8211;3.000 indicates a highly probable species-level identification, a score of 2.00&#8211;2.299 indicates genus identification and probable species-level identification, and a score of 1.70&#8211;1.999 indicates a probable genus-level identification. Bacterial Test Standards (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany; item catalog #255343) were used for the calibration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Acquisition of protein mass spectra of isolates through MALDI-TOF MS</title><p id="Par8">The Bruker flex control was used to acquire protein mass spectra. The laser frequency was 60&#160;Hz, and the laser intensity was 35% with 20 and 18.7&#160;kV of acceleration and source voltages, respectively. 240 shots of laser beam in 40-shot steps on different areas of the sample were gathered for each mass spectrum. Since there were two spots for each sample, and each sample was run three times, a total of six MS spectra for each strain were thus acquired.</p><p id="Par9">The raw spectral data obtained from three replicates were pre-processed using Flex Analysis software. This pre-processing involved smoothing, baseline subtraction, and peak identification using default algorithms, followed by a thorough quality assessment of each spectrum. Spectra exhibiting poor quality&#8212;characterized by high background noise or abnormal intensity values&#8212;were excluded from further processing. The remaining high-quality spectra were then used to generate Main Spectra Projections (MSPs) through the automated MSP creation function in the Bruker Biotyper Compass software. Each MSP encapsulated information on the mean peak masses, mean intensities, and mean frequencies. A total of 18 MSPs, each corresponding to a distinct strain, were subsequently subjected to multivariate statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Multivariate statistical analyses of protein mass spectra of isolates</title><p id="Par10">The multivariate statistical tools used for the analyses of mass spectra were principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering (dendrogram), and composite correlation index (CCI). For PCA, the Bio Typer PCA Clustering Standard Method was used. The method of clustering was chosen as hierarchical, the distance measure as correlation, and the linkage algorithm was set as average. The mass upper bound and lower bound were set as 15,000 and 3000&#160;m/z, respectively, with a resolution of 2&#160;m/z. Similarly, Bio Typer MSP Dendrogram Creation Standard Method was used for dendrogram analysis, where the distance measure was selected as correlation, and linkage as average. PCA and dendrogram helped to differentiate the strains based on their differences in the protein mass spectrum. The closely related strains were clustered together. Each cluster was then plotted in a 3D PCA graph, demonstrating the difference between each cluster.</p><p id="Par11">To calculate the CCI for isolates, the raw spectral data were first organized into m/z bins with a class interval of 5&#160;m/z, ensuring that peaks across spectra could be compared within standardized mass-to-charge ranges (Kehrmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>; Ashfaq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>). Each spectrum was then normalized to account for differences in overall intensity and to make the datasets directly comparable. Using these normalized values, the CCI was computed in Excel by generating pairwise correlation coefficients between the binned intensity profiles of all spectra. The correlation coefficient (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>) ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates no similarity (spectra are completely uncorrelated) and values close to 1 indicate very high similarity (spectra are highly correlated). The overall CCI was obtained as the average of these pairwise correlation values, providing a quantitative measure of overall diversity across the dataset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Identification of the bacterial isolates by ribotyping</title><p id="Par12">Cells were grown overnight at 30&#160;&#176;C on LB plates, and then their DNA was extracted. After being suspended in 0.5&#160;mL of distilled water, the cells were heated for 10&#160;min in a water bath and centrifuged at 12,300&#160;g for 10&#160;min. A fresh PCR amplification tube was filled with the supernatant, which contained whole DNA. Universal primers RibS73sp 5&#8242;-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCA-3&#8242; and RibS74sp 5&#8242;-AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA-3&#8242; were used to amplify the bacterial strains&#8217; 16S rRNA gene segments (1500&#160;bp). A total of 25 &#956;L of PCR buffer containing 1.5&#160;&#956;M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.8&#160;&#956;M dNTP, 1.35&#160;&#956;M of both forward and reverse primers, 10&#8211;20&#160;ng of the isolates&#8217; genomic DNA utilized as a template for PCR reactions, and 0.5&#160;IU Taq DNA polymerase was used for each PCR reaction. Each PCR reaction&#8217;s thermocycler schedule started with a three-minute initial denaturation step at 94&#160;&#176;C. 35 cycles of 45-s denaturation steps at 94&#160;&#176;C, 45-s annealing steps at 50&#160;&#176;C, and 45-s elongation steps at 72&#160;&#176;C were then followed by a final 2-min extension step at 72&#160;&#176;C. The QIAquick PCR Purification Kit from Qiagen was used to purify the amplicons. The purified amplicons were subjected to a secondary PCR, and the Applied Biosystems BigDye X-Terminator Purification Kit was used for the last purification procedures. An Applied Biosystems 3500 Series Genetic Analyzer was used for the sequencing process. The NCBI Blast server was used to identify the most closely similar sequence among those found in the GenBank database based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences that were received from each isolate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Isolation and identification of hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial strains from the produced water</title><p id="Par13">The process of isolating endogenous hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria from the produced water samples from the oil fields was performed through the enrichment culture approach with multiple steps. The objective was to focus on the bacterial isolates that tolerate high toxicity exhibited by the hydrocarbons from the produced water, then from diesel used at 5% (corresponding to 37.5&#160;g/L). Following several cycles of inoculation of fresh cultures and incubations, the cultures were enriched with the most tolerant strains, which were isolated and purified. The strains that were able to grow on solid MSM plates coated with oil were considered in this study (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The purified strains were identified using the MALDI-TOF MS technique, which generates an average spectrum for each strain. Complex collections of discrete ions with m/z ratios ranging from 2000 to 10,000 were revealed by the mass spectra. The generated peak intensity enables the detection of unique proteins, which are biomarkers among closely related isolates. As a result, the indicated peaks are identified as genus-specific biomarkers for the genera known in the database. Moreover, at the species level, the mass spectra can appear highly similar. This indicates that these protein peaks could potentially serve as species-specific biomarkers.

Instead, multivariate methods like CCI and PCA were demonstrated as suitable. PCA, an ordination technique rather than a statistical method, is utilized to visualize overall patterns and possible clustering among isolates according to their MALDI-TOF MS profiles and functional traits. PCA and hierarchical clustering (dendrograms) offer an overall perspective of spectral variance and more accurately represent biological connections between strains. These unsupervised methods capture the complete proteomic profile of every strain and are commonly endorsed for this kind of exploratory analysis.
