In Lebanon, the economic crisis has increased older people's vulnerabilities and reliance on services provided through primary healthcare centres (PHCCs). This study explores (1) factors shaping decisions of using PHCCs; (2) experiences of older people accessing PHCCs from three perspectives: the older people themselves, family members and service providers; (3) family members' experiences with accessing PHCCs; and (4) service providers' experiences with providing care for older people within PHCCs in a Northern Lebanese district.</p></sec><sec id="hex70449-sec-0020"><title>Methods</title><p>This study adopts a qualitative descriptive design with an inductive content analysis approach.

Older people reported varied access experiences shaped by factors at individual, organisational, communal, governmental&#160;and global levels. Positive experiences included enhanced autonomy, gratitude for receiving needed services, perceived care quality and socialising opportunities. However, negative experiences included humiliation and discomfort, anxiety, dependency, perceived status regression, perceived poor quality and a sense of being a burden. While some family members reported relief from getting affordable care, others reported discomfort, perceived status regression, blame for neglect&#160;and challenges with coordinating care across multiple providers. Service providers' experiences included pride in supporting older people, but resentment due to unfair remuneration.</p></sec><sec id="hex70449-sec-0040"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Findings reveal aspects of care that older people and family members appreciate and others that contribute to negative experiences.

The human experience in healthcare &#8216;integrates the sum of all interactions, every encounter among patients, families, care partners&#160;and the healthcare workforce&#8217; [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, p. 10] at different touchpoints across the continuum of care. In addition to organisations and patients' characteristics [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], environmental factors are highlighted for their influence on experiences with healthcare [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They shape patients' and families' needs, socio&#8208;economic status, values&#160;and help&#8208;seeking behaviours. They also drive organisational culture, priorities, and strategies affecting the delivery of services and the dynamics among the workforce, which impact the encounters between service users and providers.</p><p>Gaining a clear understanding of how older people perceive and experience healthcare services provided by primary healthcare centres (PHCCs) is crucial, especially as the ageing population continues to grow and increasingly relies on primary healthcare (PHC) services. Enhancing patients' experiences is correlated with improved quality of care, promoted patient engagement and adherence to treatment regimens, enhanced organisational performance, increased providers' satisfaction, and better health outcomes [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="hex70449-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Low&#8208; and middle&#8208;income countries (LMICs), comprising the majority of the global older population, require further attention [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="hex70449-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Access to PHC is key to ensuring UHC and improving health outcomes [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; however, available literature suggests that older people's experiences with access to PHC are poorly examined in LMICs and vary considering the local context, healthcare system characteristics, and older people's attributes [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="hex70449-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="hex70449-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, the characteristics, availability, attitudes and behaviours of PHC providers are identified as essential factors shaping older people's experiences with access to PHC [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><sec id="hex70449-sec-0070"><label>1.1</label><title>The Lebanese Context</title><p>Lebanon is a middle&#8208;income country with older people accounting for 11% of its total population [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since 2019, the country has been grappling with a compounded crisis, steering the healthcare system to a total collapse [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="hex70449-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The Syrian crisis, the Covid&#8208;19 pandemic, the Beirut blast and the unprecedented economic crisis particularly strained the healthcare system, with a notable shortage of financial resources and equipment [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and a massive immigration of physicians and nurses [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Main characteristics of the healthcare system apply to the PHC sector in the country; it is highly privatised, fragmented and therapeutic&#8208;care oriented because of the nominal fund dedicated to preventive care (only 5% of the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health [MOPH] budget) [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Due to a shortage of geriatric wards and specialists [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], general practitioners and nurses mainly deliver care to older people. This is not expected to improve due to providers' immigration [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>As multiple crises accumulate and challenge the living in Lebanon, older people may be particularly vulnerable to financial, health and social stressors. More than 50% of them do not benefit from health coverage and social pension plans. They rely on their families to get needed services, which may result in delayed care [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and interference of family members in healthcare&#8208;seeking decisions [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Evidence from Lebanon identified 75% of older people living with at least one disease, and 25% reported having a poor health status [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Lebanese citizens have always preferred to seek primary care from private providers [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="hex70449-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], rather than from the PHC network (300 PHCCs in 2023), established by the MOPH to deliver a package of affordable PHC services across the country [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="hex70449-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A shift in healthcare&#8208;seeking behaviours towards an increased use of PHCCs, by 97% in 2023 compared to 2019, was noted after the economic recession [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], while experiences of older people with access to those centres are still unexplored.</p><p>Therefore, this study aims to (1) identify factors influencing older people's decisions to use services delivered at PHCCs; (2) explore experiences of older people accessing PHCCs from three perspectives: the older people themselves, family members and service providers; (3) explore family members' experiences of accessing PHCCs; and (4) explore service providers' experience of delivering PHC to older people within PHCCs. While this study focuses on older people's experiences with access to PHCCs, it acknowledges the inherent influence of family members and service providers' experiences.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="hex70449-sec-0080"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="hex70449-sec-0090"><label>2.1</label><title>Study Setting</title><p>We conducted this study in Koura, a district in the North Lebanon governorate, selected for being a peripheral area lacking specialised care for older people. Koura district is comprised of mostly rural villages with urban centres and 84,600 people from varying cultural backgrounds, reflecting the mixed Lebanese community [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While older people account for 10.9% of the population in Koura, 78.5% of households report an average or poorer economic status, affecting their access to PHC, particularly in rural areas of the district [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Healthcare in Koura shares similar challenges and characteristics with the broader Lebanese healthcare system. Residents are served by a mix of public, private and non&#8208;governmental institutions, including five PHCCs operating according to the Lebanese national PHC standards, three hospitals, and several dispensaries and private clinics. For this study, we selected two PHCCs representing different funding sources (internal vs. external) and staff mix composition, along with varying size and cultural background of beneficiaries.</p></sec><sec id="hex70449-sec-0100"><label>2.2</label><title>Study Design</title><p>This descriptive qualitative study, conducted from a pragmatic lens, involved older people as users and non&#8208;users of PHCCs' services, family members and service providers, to capture different perspectives and experiences [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While users are expected to provide their actual experiences, non&#8208;users may highlight constraining factors. The insights of family members are essential as they significantly support older people in their healthcare decision&#8208;making [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Service providers highlight system&#8208;based factors that shape older people's decisions and experiences. This multi&#8208;perspective approach enriches the study and allows for triangulation of data sources, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of older people's access to PHCCs.</p><p>Qualitative descriptive designs are widely used in healthcare and service research as they provide a comprehensive summary of events, which is particularly useful for practitioners and policymakers [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="hex70449-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. They generate rich and straightforward descriptions while staying close to the data and participants' language [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This research design aligns with the pragmatic focus of this study to generate actionable knowledge that informs future practice [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is particularly suitable since knowledge of the topic in Lebanon is limited. Moreover, there is a pressing need to understand and address access issues amid combined crises exacerbating older people's vulnerabilities [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Older people who did not use PHCCs' services (designated as non&#8208;users or NUP) and family members of non&#8208;users (designated as FMNU) were recruited through municipalities where the two PHCCs were located. Participants eligible to take part in this study were (1) Lebanese adults aged 60 years and older, using different PHCCs' services during the past year or not using PHCCs' services, and able to provide consent for themselves; (2) close relatives who are the main caregivers for users and non&#8208;users; and (3) service providers including administrators and health professionals with at least 1 year of professional experience with the selected PHCCs and serving older people. Older people living in residential homes were excluded as they receive PHC through those institutions. Eligible individuals were informed about the study through focal people at selected PHCCs and municipalities. Those who were interested contacted the principal investigator (PI), who recruited participants on purpose to ensure maximum variation considering the use of PHCCs services, socio&#8208;economic status, age and gender criteria. Two criteria were used to determine the sample size: (1) authors' judgement on the achievement of adequate data to answer the research questions and develop themes [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], alongside (2) code saturation (no new codes) and meaning saturation (no iterative descriptions to codes listed in the codebook) [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

FGDs took around 90&#8201;min and were conducted either at PHCCs or at an accessible venue for all participants, while the 20&#8208; to 45&#8208;min interviews took place at participants' homes. All participants were asked about their views regarding (1) older people's experiences with access to PHCCs and (2) factors and perceptions shaping older people's decisions to use services delivered at PHCCs. Family members were also asked to describe their experiences of accessing PHCCs. Service providers were additionally asked to reflect on their experiences with providing care for older people within PHCCs. The data included socio&#8208;demographic characteristics (Table&#160;<xref rid="hex70449-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>) and were collected in Arabic and audio&#8208;recorded according to the provided consent.</p></sec><sec id="hex70449-sec-0140"><label>2.6</label><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Simultaneously with data collection, the PI manually transcribed the audio recordings verbatim, reviewed the manuscripts and noted impressions, which facilitated a deeper immersion in the data. To involve non&#8208;Arabic speaking co&#8208;authors in data analysis, 3 transcripts out of 22 were translated into English, consisting of one FGD manuscript per participant category, to provide broad data. At the early coding stages, S.D., T.K. and K.F. independently coded the translated transcripts and then met to discuss and ensure that all relevant aspects were captured. Given the high inter&#8208;coder agreement, the authors decided to continue the analysis of the remaining data in Arabic to conserve the meaning carried by participants' language, which enhances data trustworthiness [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Analysis steps as described by Erlingsson and Brysiewicz [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] were followed. The PI (S.D.) condensed transcripts into meaning units consisting of words or sentences conveying essential information regarding the research questions. Meaning units were coded in each transcript and then charted into a spreadsheet, with columns showing codes and rows showing acronyms corresponding to the different participant categories and data collection methods (e.g., SP&#8208;FGD2). Iterative coding was applied to ensure that newly identified codes are not missed in transcripts coded earlier. Codes were sorted into eight categories (Table&#160;<xref rid="hex70449-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>) related to research aims. Initial codes and descriptors were iteratively updated (Supporting Material&#160;<xref rid="hex70449-suppl-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>) and shared with co&#8208;authors for discussion and further refinement. Through collaborative discussions among co&#8208;authors, themes were then developed expressing the underlying meaning of codes [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To facilitate data triangulation, a different spreadsheet was used to map codes under each category (columns), and across different participants and data collection methods (rows). This multistage approach to analysis allowed us to summarise, then compare and contrast data to reflect different viewpoints across participant categories, and present rich descriptions. After removing personal data identifiers, the second bilingual co&#8208;author (M.A.) verified the coding of meaning units, the generation of categories, and data mapping. Accordingly, S.D. and M.A. discussed and made iterative changes. The extensive list of translated quotations (Supporting Material&#160;<xref rid="hex70449-suppl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref>) was used to enhance the confirmability of the PI's interpretation.

While some participants acknowledged their unfamiliarity with the PHC concept, others mistakenly included tertiary and secondary care services, such as hospitalisations and surgeries, within primary care. Moreover, many participants, even service providers, used the terms PHCCs and dispensaries interchangeably, with dispensaries being the familiar term.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>I never heard about primary health care.</p><attrib>UP, female, 60&#8211;70 age group</attrib></disp-quote>

This is due to the collapse of savings at banks, currency devaluation and dysfunctional public insurance schemes. Several participants stated that they started accessing PHCCs after the economic crisis, seeking chronic medications that either became unavailable at pharmacies or were very expensive. Contextual factors have implications on the personal level; many older people who used to be financially independent rely fully on their children and are obliged to seek services from PHCCs.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>Mr. the army commander and I have the same case, we used to have 100% health coverage and many other benefits; we should not have been obliged to come to the primary care centre, they are humiliating us after all these years.</p><attrib>UP, male, 60&#8211;70 age group</attrib></disp-quote>

People who used to work within the private sector stated that they paid taxes and lost their health insurance at retirement age, when they mostly needed healthcare. Older people contrast their status with peers living abroad and blame the government for lacking pension plans, health coverage, transportation assistance and prescheduled regular check&#8208;up appointments, which impede their access to healthcare, especially to private settings.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>In Lebanon, older people are left to their unknown fate.

It also acknowledges the experiences of family members accessing PHCCs and those of service providers delivering PHC to older people within PHCCs.</p><p>The insights gained from this study revealed shared perceptions among participants. These include the perceived consequences of the economic crisis that increased the financial dependency, limited the access to private care, increased reliance on PHCCs and aggravated older people's feelings of being a burden. The lack of government support for older people, anxiety because of service discontinuity, squeezed clinical examinations and discomfort due to poor service organisation were common reported factors contributing to negative experiences. However, the findings also showed divergent views. For instance, service providers valued the support they provide for older people, who in return expressed that services at PHCCs are not meeting their expectations and reported feelings of humiliation. Users of PHCCs have better perceptions regarding the quality of services provided by PHCCs compared with non&#8208;users. While some users showed gratitude for the support they received, others reported challenges undermining their dignity.</p><sec id="hex70449-sec-0360"><label>4.1</label><title>Decisions Related to Using Services Delivered by PHCCs</title><p>This study identifies different factors underlying the use or non&#8208;use of services delivered through PHCCs and highlights a shift in reliance on these services following the economic crisis. The findings suggest that PHCCs constitute a preferred choice due to their affordable services and proximity, particularly for older people with functional limitations or limited family support. Additional factors encouraging the use of PHCC services include positive attitudes and behaviours of service providers, as well as familiar and simple service processes.</p><p>Socio&#8208;economic status and unequal health coverage emerged as significant factors delineating the choice of care settings, with a predominant preference for private care as long as it remains affordable. Consistent with literature from LMICs [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="hex70449-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], this preference stems from a common perception that private healthcare offers better quality than PHCC services. Family members, having an essential role in healthcare&#8208;seeking decisions [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], do not recommend PHCCs for their older parents. However, this pattern started changing since the onset of the economic crisis (2019), which restricted families' ability to afford private care and increased older people's vulnerabilities. This explains a nearly 100% surge in services delivered at PHCCs between 2019 and 2023 [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The obligation to use services perceived as lower quality due to economic constraints illustrates how public policies and socio&#8208;economic factors perpetuate inequities in healthcare access [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The study also reveals an information gap constraining the use of PHCCs. In general, Lebanese people have negative perceptions about dispensaries [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Mixing between dispensaries and PHCCs might have a negative influence on the image and use of PHCCs. People in the aftermath of the economic crisis significantly need affordable preventive and therapeutic services offered at PHCCs. The lack of information about such services may lead to unmet needs and poor health outcomes, deepened health disparities, and poor healthcare system performance [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The main service sought at PHCCs was chronic medication provision, because of market shortages during the crisis [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and price increase after the lift of governmental subsidy [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This high demand could also be linked to the characteristics of participants, confirming the high prevalence of chronic diseases among older people who present low to medium socio&#8208;economic status. The unexpected surge in demand has complicated the supply of services, particularly medications, which poses particular risks for people who have long depended on PHCCs and have no alternatives. Such challenges risk aggravating healthcare inequities and exacerbating adverse health outcomes, lack of adherence to treatment regimens, and mental burden [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>The rising transportation costs have further compelled older people to seek care at nearby PHCCs. The increased reliance on PHCCs adds further strains to an already under&#8208;resourced PHC system struggling with diminished funds, partly because of ongoing global conflicts [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="hex70449-sec-0370"><label>4.2</label><title>Experiences With Access to PHCCs</title><p>Exploring access experiences was important, especially since perceptions of healthcare encounters impact the sustainment of service use [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Findings highlight varying experiences across PHCCs. Despite being all affiliated with the MOPH, a discrepancy exists across centres regarding service delivery, organisation and funding [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], with implications on care experiences. Findings are aligned with evidence from LMICs suggesting that care experiences vary according to socio&#8208;economic contexts and service delivery models [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>For some participants, access to PHCCs constitutes a gateway to restored dignity and well&#8208;being, which confirms the PHC value, especially during economic downturns [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While family members feel relieved to get affordable care, older people report enhanced autonomy and familiarity with processes, gratitude for receiving affordable and quality services, and a sense of being respected, heard and cared for. However, access to free or affordable care implies a burden, including discomfort and a perception of status regression reported by older people and family members who feel obliged to seek perceived low&#8208;quality services. Family members feel guilty for seeking care from PHCCs, especially since some older people experience humiliation and unfairness. While negative experiences of older people with access to PHC in LMICs are common [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="hex70449-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], insights stemming from this study are grounded within the Lebanese context. This offers an opportunity for a people&#8208;centred transformation of services to address healthcare inequities [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Experiences of older people and family members are interrelated, since family members either seek care for older people or interfere in healthcare&#8208;seeking decisions [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Understanding the experiences of family members was essential since negative perceptions may either suppress access to PHCCs or deepen the humiliating feeling of being obliged to use low&#8208;quality services. Older people and service providers' experiences also seem interconnected. Service providers experiencing unfair work conditions feel drained and powerless due to the increased demand complicated by short funds [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This may aggravate the existing risk of burnout and turnover [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], impact the quality of care [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and affect the relational aspect, and thus, older people's experiences [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Interconnected experiences suggest that improving older people's access to PHCCs requires a comprehensive approach that simultaneously addresses the unique needs of older people, family members and service providers.</p><p>Findings from this study converge with the work of Wolf et al. [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] to confirm that human experiences with healthcare are shaped by factors that surpass the individual and organisational levels. They also align with the socio&#8208;ecological perspective, suggesting that health behaviours and experiences are influenced by factors at multiple levels [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We draw on this perspective to illustrate the complexity of factors shaping care decisions and experiences, as identified by participants (Figure&#160;<xref rid="hex70449-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" fig-type="Figure" id="hex70449-fig-0002" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Older people's experiences with access to PHCCs.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-3" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="HEX-28-e70449-g001.jpg"/></fig><p>At the individual level, experiences varied with the functional abilities, socio&#8208;economic status and place of residence, highlighting the importance of social determinants of health in shaping healthcare access [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Older people presenting functional problems or a social role to fulfil reported negative experiences regarding the long waiting time, a factor perceived by other retired people as an opportunity to socialise. Individuals who felt obliged to use PHCC services because of their recent financial disadvantage reported more humiliating experiences compared to others who started seeking such services before the crisis. People living near PHCCs reported fewer challenges in reaching PHCCs compared to those who are distant. Similarly, the influence of geographical barriers [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and socio&#8208;economic disparities [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] on access to PHC in LMICs is well documented. Financial dependency induces a feeling of being a burden among older people, translated into delayed care and neglected preventive services, which are essential to manage comorbidities that prevail at older age [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>At the organisational level, short and unstable funds remain key barriers to quality improvement, affecting service availability, affordability, approachability, organisation and quality [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As previously evidenced [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="hex70449-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the relational aspect was of paramount importance. The unfair payment and overcrowding experienced by physicians are jeopardising the quality of care and threatening the sustainability of their work at PHCCs. This could aggravate existing staffing issues [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and exhaust the remaining personnel, with critical implications on care quality and relationships [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In line with national data, administrators are challenged to manage the care delivery and operational costs with limited funds, which threatens the sustainment of their institutions [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Findings support evidence suggesting that enhancing the quality of care and users' experiences goes through caring for the workforce and ensuring fair pay, training opportunities and work prospects [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="hex70449-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>At the community level, findings meet the descriptions by Wolf et al. [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] on the influence of social beliefs and shared experiences on older people's perception of care. PHCCs' services are perceived as below standard, and PHCC users are labelled as disadvantaged. This is exacerbating the feeling of humiliation among people who feel obliged to use such services following the economic crisis. Lacking transportation infrastructure and rising related costs add to older people's challenges with accessing PHCCs [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The governmental and global factors influence all other levels. For example, the lack of social pension plans [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] affects the socio&#8208;economic status of individuals; the minimal investment in primary care and lack of financial support to PHCCs [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] exacerbate resource shortages and affect organisational processes and priorities; the exclusive reliance on NGOs to ensure chronic medications leads to care discontinuity. The reliance on external funds has contributed to the resilience of the PHC system during all crisis times [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, the dependency on uncertain funds threatens the viability of PHC services [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], especially with global conflicts and wars imposing new emergencies leading to a shift of funds [<xref rid="hex70449-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="hex70449-sec-0380"><label>4.3</label><title>Implication for Policy and Practice</title><p>Understanding older people's experiences with access to PHCCs is key to improving the quality of care.

The study also presents limitations, including the limited volume of translated data, which restricts the full involvement of co&#8208;authors in all data analysis steps. This was due to financial resources and data protection restrictions inherent in the ethical approval granted to the study. Recruitment methods excluded people with cognitive limitations and limited phone accessibility. This was mitigated through the involvement of family members who represented their views. The FGD method may have restricted individual responses, as some older people, in particular, may not be familiar with this method. Data inaccuracy might have been induced due to recall bias among participants, the social desirability response bias, and the possible mix of experiences across PHCCs and dispensaries. Data triangulation was useful to mitigate such biases. Due to the research design nature, findings are not generalisable but could be transferable to people sharing the same participants' characteristics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="hex70449-sec-0400"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Understanding the experiences of older people accessing PHCCs is necessary to transform practices and health systems. This study shows that access to PHCC is a choice for some older people and families and a gateway towards care and well&#8208;being amidst the dire economic crisis. However, it remains an obligation for many others who lack alternatives and report negative experiences. Findings call for action at the organisational, communal, governmental and global levels to support Lebanese older people in accessing PHC and living with dignity.
