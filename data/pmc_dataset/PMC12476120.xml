In this sample, 7 were male (63.6%) and 4 female (36.4%). There were 7 cases of subdural empyema (63.6%), 2 cases of extradural empyema (18.2%) and 2 cases with both subdural and extradural empyema (18.2%). There were significant underlying co-morbidities in 2 cases (18%). The frontal sinus was suspected source in 10 cases (91%). Endoscopic sinus surgery was performed in 10 cases (91%); with 9 of these cases (90%) as/with the initial operation or within 24 hours of initial operation. Craniotomy was required in 9 cases total (81%), with 5 cases (56%) as/with the initial operation or within 24 hours of initial operation. After initial craniotomy 4 cases (44%) required further neurosurgical evacuation of abscess. Additionally, 2 cases managed with initial burrhole later required craniotomy. All 3 cases of small volume subdural empyema without neurological deficit were initially managed with endoscopic sinus surgery only and all cases subsequently required craniotomy. All cases with subdural empyema required craniotomy (n=9) whereas all cases with isolated extradural empyema avoided craniotomy (n=2). There was a longer length of stay in those that presented with neurology or low GCS than those that did not (27 days &#177; 10 compared to 86 days &#177; 41, p= 0.009). Long term morbidity and repeated neurosurgical intervention were more common in those cases with subdural empyema than those without subdural empyema, (55% vs 0% and 67% vs 0% respectively) although only 2 patients did not have subdural empyema (no statistical analysis available given small numbers). A Streptococcus milleri group microbe was isolated in 82% of cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Endoscopic sinus surgery does not seem effective at preventing the need for craniotomy in cases of subdural empyema. It does have a role in aiding microbiological diagnosis. ESS may have a role in the treatment of extradural empyema and avoiding craniotomy. Subdural empyema has a higher morbidity and return to theatre rate than extradural empyema. Those that present with a neurological deficit or decreased GCS have a longer length of stay. Larger studies are required to assess the timing and extent of surgical interventions for subdural and extradural empyema.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>paediatric</kwd><kwd>sinusitis</kwd><kwd>subdural</kwd><kwd>extradural</kwd><kwd>empyema</kwd><kwd>surgery</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sinusitis complicates between 5-10% of all upper respiratory tract infections in the paediatric population<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, with intracranial complications reported in 10% of patients hospitalised, and approximately 30% of patients admitted with frontal sinus involvement<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Although rare, the intracranial complications of sinusitis are associated with high mortality (~3.3%) and morbidity (~27%), such as hemiparesis, aphasia, and epilepsy, so are regarded as a medical and surgical emergency<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The frontal sinus is postulated to have a more vulnerable skeletal framework due to its abundant network of valveless diploic veins, that drain the frontal sinus mucosa and interconnect with the dural venous sinuses, emissary veins and subdural veins. Retrograde propagation of thrombophlebitis through this venous system results in indirect or haematogenous spread. This method is believed to be more common than direct spread of infection, where bacteria directly enters the intracranial compartment through a necrotic defect in the posterior sinus wall secondary to osteomyelitis<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>There can often be delayed diagnosis in the paediatric population with an already established intracranial collection at presentation and more fulminant clinical course. A recent meta-analysis on the management of intracranial complications of paediatric sinusitis suggests that a multidisciplinary team approach with aggressive treatment achieves favourable outcomes, but states that the most effective surgical method remains unclear given the wide variety of study designs, surgical techniques, and complications included<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.

After obtaining institutional audit approval we analysed theatre management system records to identify all paediatric emergency cases that underwent endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) or neurosurgical evacuation of abscess (including other relevant terms), and cross referenced this with discharge coding records for subdural and extradural empyema to obtain our patient population. We then examined patient records and imaging findings to exclude non-sinogenic causes and excluded other complications of sinusitis that did not have subdural or extradural empyema (e.g., orbital abscess, venous sinus thrombosis, meningitis etc). Data on demographics, presenting features, surgical management, length of stay, radiological investigations, microbiology results and long-term morbidity was recorded in a spreadsheet. Data was analysed via means and standard deviation, or median and interquartile range. The Mann Whitney U Test was used to compare means (SPSS version 26).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>3.1 Patients</title><p>We identified 11 patients with sinogenic subdural or extradural empyema. The mean age was 11.3 years (&#177; 2.3), ranging from 7 to 14 years. In our data, 7 patients were male (63.6%) and 4 were female (36.4%). Two patients had significant underlying medical co-morbidities, 1 patient had a history of familial dystonic cerebral palsy with a deep brain stimulator in situ, and 1 patient had trisomy 21 and factor V Leidin deficiency. The remaining patients had no significant medical co-morbidities with no previous documentation of chronic rhinosinusitis. The clinical features documented to warrant imaging investigation were headaches (n=7, 63.6%), peri-orbital or facial swelling (n=5, 45%), persistent pyrexia (n=4, 36%), reduced Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] (n=3, 27%), seizures (n=2, 18%) and hemiplegia (n=1, 9%).</p></sec><sec><title>3.2 Imaging</title><p>All 11 patients were investigated with a contrast enhanced CT scan, with 3 patients (27.3%) having both CT and MRI scan. In 1 case, an extra dural abscess was not identified on initial contrast enhanced CT scan but seen on MRI. In another case, a contrast enhanced CT scan was performed and initially reported no intracranial empyema. This patient had a sinus washout and was managed with intravenous antibiotics. They later developed seizure activity and had repeat imaging demonstrating a subdural empyema. A very small subtle subdural empyema was reported in retrospect on the initial CT scan. For the purpose of this study, we treated this as a subdural empyema initially managed conservatively with ESS. In the other 9 cases the empyemas were identified on the initial imaging modality (with 2 other cases having additional MRI scan for further evaluation of abscess). Of the 11 patients, 7 cases (63.6%) had only subdural emypemas, 2 cases (18.2%) had only extradural empyemas and 2 cases (18.2%) had both subdural and extradural empyemas. The frontal sinus was the suspected index sinus in 10 (90.9%) cases with the sphenoethmoidal sinuses the source for 1 case (9.1%). A bony defect in the index sinus was reported in 2 cases (18.1%) with indirect haematogenous spread suspected in 9 cases (81.8%).</p></sec><sec><title>3.3 Surgical Management Summary</title><p><xref rid="f01" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> displays the surgical management of all 11 cases.

Of those 9 patients, 4 patients (44%) had a craniotomy as part of their initial surgery, one patient had craniotomy (11%) within 24 hours after burrhole and ESS and 1 patient (11%) had craniotomy within 72 hours of initial burrhole. 3 patients (33%) had a craniotomy after failed conservative measures with ESS only. These were 3 cases of small volume empyema and no neurological deficit, all of which later went on to develop seizure activity. All cases with subdural empyema (n=9, 100%) required craniotomy. All cases of isolated extradural empyema (n=2, 100%) avoided craniotomy (1 managed with combined burrhole/ESS and 1 managed with ESS and frontal trephine) and were managed as single stage operations.

Follow-up time for this patient is just outside the first year and is continuing to improve with only minimal residual weakness. Of those with treated extra-dural empyema only (n=2), there were no long-term complications.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>ESS as an adjunct to intravenous antibiotics, can be a challenging operation in the paediatric population during an acute infective episode. Children have a smaller nasal passage and underaeration of paranasal sinuses compared to the adult population, and access will be further impeded with oedematous intra-nasal mucosa and a higher propensity to bleed. There are a wide range of potential sinus operations to consider, ranging from a simple sinus washout, middle meatal antrostomy, limited ethmoidectomy or frontal trephine, up to more advanced full house endoscopic sinus procedures with navigation guidance, frontal sinus drillout and direct drainage of intracranial empyema. There are a range of options to treat the subdural or extradural empyema including parenteral antibiotics, burrhole evacuations, craniotomy or cranialisation of the frontal sinus.</p><p>There is ongoing debate regarding the best management for subdural and extradural empyema secondary to sinusitis.</p><p>A recent 2021 meta-analysis has shown that in the past 45 years there has been no significant change in pooled estimates in paediatric outcomes for 90 day mortality (2.3% [95% CI, 1.1%-3.6%; <italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0, p&gt;0.99]), permanent neurological disability (21.3% [95% CI, 15.3%-27.3%; <italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 75.2%, p &lt;0.001]), or return to theatre (37.3% [95% CI, 29.5%-45%; <italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 71.2%, p&lt;0.001]) despite a statistical increase in the use of ESS over the study time period<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. This suggests that the increasing prevalence on ESS is not associated with better outcomes. The study also compares the same outcomes for combined ENT and neurosurgical procedure versus sinus intervention only versus neurosurgery only. It again did not demonstrate any significant difference in the outcomes between the groups but highlights the large degree of selection bias and the need for further robust studies<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p>Some centres advocate an early aggressive combined ENT and neurosurgical operation. Farah et al. 2008 published their retrospective series of 20 paediatric patients over a 7-year study period<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. After identification of subdural empyema all patients proceeded to have a wide craniotomy with pus washout and deloculation if septae were present, with concurrent sinus washout: they had 1 mortality in their series. They report 10 patients (50%) having seizure activity (4 patients pre-operatively and 6 patients post-operatively), all of which had good seizure control and discontinuation of anti-epileptics after 1 year. They reported 3 patients with a transient neurological deficit, with all surviving patients in their study having a Glasgow Outcome Scale of 5 (indicating good recovery with resumption of normal life but there may be minor neurological or psychological disability) at 1 year. In their study 20% of cases had recollection of subdural empyema requiring further surgical intervention, which is better than the reported meta-analysis rate of 37%<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, and indeed better than our rate of repeated neurosurgical intervention of 54%. They suggest the role for conservative measures with intravenous antibiotics is only appropriate in the early phase before any collection of pus<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. It is worth noting however that with such small numbers, data can be skewed e.g. if patients present late in the course of their disease with more extensive abscess they are more likely to require multiple operations.</p><p>Patel et al. 2015 also recommend early combined ENT and neurosurgical procedure<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Their 5-year study identified 27 paediatric cases of sinogenic intracranial abscess, of which 17 cases (63%) were managed as a joint ENT/neurosurgical procedure and again showed rate of revision neurosurgical procedures rates at 22%. They managed 6 cases (22%) with an ENT procedure only (in cases with small abscesses and no focal neurological deficit), with 50% of these later requiring a neurosurgical operation. Of the cases that were successfully managed without a neurosurgical operation there were 2 were extradural abscesses and 1 was a parenchymal abscess<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. In our study, we had 4 cases with small abscess and no focal neurological deficit which were initially managed with an ENT only operation, 75% of which required a neurosurgical operation. Also in our study, the 1 case that was successfully managed without a neurosurgical operation was an extradural abscess, with the 3 subdural empyemas all requiring craniotomy.</p><p>Patel et al. demonstrated that subdural abscesses are associated with a significantly poorer clinical course and outcome than extradural abscess<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. In their study they had 14 cases of extradural abscess and 9 cases of subdural abscess. They found morbidity at 6 months significantly higher in the subdural group at 67% compared to the extradural group at 14% (p=0.0166). Our study showed long-term morbidity of 55% in subdural empyemas (with a further 22% on prophylactic anti-epileptic medications within the first year of surgery) compared to 0% of extradural empyemas. Patel et al. found no cases of extradural abscesses presented with a neurological deficit versus 78% of subdural empyema (p=0.0001), and 7% had reduced GCS on admission in extradural empyema versus 56% in subdural empyema (p=0.0183) [6]. Similarly, in our study, 0% of isolated extradural empyema had any neurological deficit or reduced GCS, and 66% of our subdural empyemas presented with low GCS or neurological deficit. In both studies, no cases of only extradural empyema had any seizure activity. In their study, no extradural empyema required multiple neurosurgical operations versus 67% of subdural empyemas<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Our study shows identical results of no extradural operations requiring repeat neurosurgical operations and 67% of subdural empyema requiring repeat neurosurgical intervention. All our cases of subdural empyemas that were initially managed with burrhole later required craniotomy.</p><p>Other studies have however demonstrated benefits from a more conservative approach. Del Gaudio et al. performed a 5-year retrospective analysis of 23 patients with intracranial complications of sinusitis<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. The median age of cases in their study was 14 years, with 3 cases over the age of 21. In their study, 20 cases had intracranial abscesses. There was 1 death, 9 cases had emergent craniotomy, and 10 cases were trialled with initial conservative measures in patients with an abscess &lt;1cm with no neurological deficit. Of the 10 cases managed conservatively, 4 cases (40%) were managed conservatively with antibiotics alone and 6 cases (60%) were managed with antibiotics and endoscopic sinus surgery. Of those cases managed with antibiotics alone, 50% later required operative intervention with craniotomy, whereas 83% of those managed with antibiotics and ESS required craniotomy. These results would suggest that the use of ESS does not appear to alter the need for neurosurgical intervention, and they question its role in the acute setting. They reported no increase in morbidity associated with initial conservative management and avoided a craniotomy in 3 cases<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>Del Guadio et al. go on to discuss the aetiology of intracranial abscesses secondary to sinusitis and the 2 proposed routes of spread of infection: direct and indirect. They report that intracranial complications of sinusitis are most commonly a result of indirect spread through the frontal sinus<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. In our study, the frontal sinus was the index sinus in 91% of cases and the sphenoethmoidal sinuses responsible for 9% of cases. There was direct communication, or a bony defect reported in 18% of cases with indirect spread responsible for 82% of cases. Of note in our study, both cases that had a direct method of spread were managed as a single stage operation. Del Guadio et al. reported only 4% of their cases as having a direct method of spread and suggest ESS is indicated in these cases in the acute setting. They do not advise ESS in the acute setting in the management of intracranial complications of sinusitis when secondary to indirect spread. They also advise reserving ESS for recurrent intracranial abscess despite neurosurgical drainage with persistent acute or subacute rhinosinusitis, or to treat persistent rhinosinusitis after the intracranial abscess has been treated<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. In our study, both cases that had direct spread were managed as a single stage operation, with one case not requiring any neurosurgical intervention.</p><p>Garin et al. performed a study assessing the role of ESS in sinogenic epidural and subdural empyema. In their 2-year retrospective paediatric study they identified 9 subdural empyemas and 8 extradural empyemas<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. In their subdural empyema population 2 cases (22%) had initial craniotomy of which 100% were managed in a single operation and none of which had any long-term morbidity. They had 6 cases (67%) that were initially managed with only endoscopic transnasal approaches (ETA): 83% later required craniotomy, which is comparable to 100% in our study; 17% did not require craniotomy. They had 1 case with subdural empyema that had an initial burrhole but later required craniotomy, which again is similar to our study in that all our cases (n=2) of subdural empyema that trialled initial burrhole later required craniotomy. They concluded that the best surgical approach for subdural empyema is a large craniotomy, and that the role of ESS is potentially limited to aiding microbiological diagnosis<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>They however, did suggest that endoscopic transnasal approaches could be used as an alternative to open neurosurgical approaches when managing extradural empyema if direct drainage of the empyema can be accessed transnasally<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. When frontal sinuses are involved, they advise using a Draf III procedure with direct opening of the posterior sinus wall. Of 4 patients where the empyema could be drained directly transnasally they successfully managed 3 of these cases (75%) without craniotomy. Performing a Draf III procedure with direct drainage of abscess may not however be feasible in all units, as an emergency procedure out of hours in an unwell paediatric patient.</p><p>Cranialisation has been demonstrated as an alternative to a combined ENT and neurosurgical procedure when the offending sinus is the frontal sinus, particularly when there is evidence of infection or osteitis on the posterior table of the frontal sinus<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. During this procedure the empyema is evacuated, the posterior wall of the frontal sinus is removed, the nasal sinus mucosa is removed and the nasofrontal duct is plugged off. Patel et al. performed cranialisation in 3 cases and avoided the need for ESS, with 33% required a further neurosurgical procedure<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. The disadvantages of cranialisation over FESS sinusotomy is the lack of preservation of normal bony and mucosal anatomy, frontal neuralgia, technical difficulties in obliterating the tract and need for repeat imaging to assess for mucocele formation<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Graft remodelling, in the graft used to plug the nasofrontal duct, may also mimic recurrent disease on follow-up imaging modalities. We did not use cranialisation in any of our cases.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>One of the biggest limitations of our study is that it is a single centred retrospective study and its small number of patients. We are the regional centre covering Northern Ireland with a general population of approximately 1.9 million<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, yet the average cases of sub-or-extradural empyema are approximately 1 case per year (11 cases in 10 years). It is difficult to compare our sample to other studies given our small cohort size, different types of procedures used, and the fact patients often had multiple procedures within 24 hours. Those patients that are more unwell with a neurological deficit on presentation were more likely to have craniotomy and ESS whereas those with smaller volume abscess with no neurological deficit had wider range of management strategies (ranging from conservative management to ESS only, to neurological procedure only or combined operation). Larger or multicentre studies must be done to identify best management strategies for these patients. There are few robust studies in the literature and no randomised controlled trials. Our study only had 2 cases of isolated extradural abscesses, and these seemed to have better prognosis. Once again, more studies are needed to draw firm conclusions. In our study, 2 patients had significant medical co-morbidities, which is likely a confounding factor when assessing any outcomes. It is also possible that there may be underreporting of subtle subdural and extradural abscesses on initial CT imaging that may successfully be managed conservatively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Sinogenic subdural and extradural empyemas are associated with high morbidity. Multi-disciplinary team management between surgeons, Neurosurgeons, Paediatricians, Radiologists, and Infectious Diseases leads to a diverse array of timings and types of interventions. Children with neurological deficit prior to initial operation had a statistically longer length of stay (p=0.009). Subdural empyema had a poorer clinical outcome compared to extradural empyema, with higher morbidity and more frequently requiring repeated neurosurgical interventions. Aggressive medical and surgical management is advised. The use of ESS in subdural empyema does not seem to avoid the need for craniotomy, although it can aid in microbiological diagnosis. In cases of subdural empyema secondary to sinusitis we would therefore recommend a joint neurosurgical craniotomy with ENT middle meatal antrostomy for microbiology sampling as the initial operation, avoiding more complex ENT procedures out of hours. The use of ESS in extradural empyema, particularly with direct spread of infection, may be of more benefit, although larger more robust studies must be undertaken.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
