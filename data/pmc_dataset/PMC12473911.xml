UV irradiation was implemented at different intensities (10,000&#8211;40,000 lux) and with different exposure times (1 and 5 min) by two different methods: irradiating the film-forming solution before casting (S-UV) versus irradiating the pre-cast film (F-UV). The UV treatment significantly increased the elastic modulus (EM) while decreasing the tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (EAB), and water-vapor permeability (WVP) of the films (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), irrespective of the irradiation method used. This effect became more pronounced with higher UV intensity and longer exposure times. When both LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> were present, UV irradiation promoted the formation of non-disulfide covalent bonds, leading to increased cross-linking. This cross-linking improved the film&#8217;s strength and decreased its WVP, although it did cause the films to become yellowish. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed interactions between the gelatin and LA, indicated by a decrease in the intensity of Amide-A, Amide-I, and Amide-II bands. A key finding suggested that UV irradiation, combined with LA/FeCl<sub>2</sub> incorporation, could significantly enhance the properties of fish skin gelatin films, especially their water-vapor barrier.

Introduction</title><p>Polymers are widely used for food packaging, but growing concerns about pollution are driving a shift toward more sustainable options. Biodegradable films derived from biopolymers are emerging as a viable alternative to traditional petroleum-based materials. These films are typically made from proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides [<xref rid="B1-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Protein-based films have gained significant attention for their potential as eco-friendly packaging due to their excellent film-forming capabilities. Among these, films made from fish skin gelatin are particularly promising. They are appealing for food packaging applications because of their notable transparency and ability to be combined with beneficial bioactive compounds [<xref rid="B3-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite their advantages, gelatin films have a major drawback due to their inherent hydrophilic nature. This high affinity for water causes them to swell, degrade, or dissolve when exposed to moisture. This sensitivity to humidity negatively impacts their performance, leading to dimensional instability, lower mechanical strength, and reduced barrier properties, which ultimately decreases the shelf life of packaged products. These weaknesses limit their use in food packaging, where robust barrier properties are essential for preserving product quality and extending shelf life [<xref rid="B1-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B4-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>To lower the hydrophilic nature of gelatin films, incorporating hydrophobic substances like fatty acids, oils, and waxes is a common method for reducing the water-attracting properties of gelatin films [<xref rid="B5-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Studies have shown that adding different fatty acids, including palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids, to biopolymer films (especially gelatin-based ones) improves their hydrophobicity, water-vapor barrier, and flexibility [<xref rid="B7-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example, a study by Nor Amalini et al. [<xref rid="B8-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] found that the addition of sucrose esters of palmitic and stearic acid to gelatin films significantly lowered their water-vapor permeability and solubility, while also increasing their opacity.</p><p>Additionally, the use of oxidized lipids, specifically the reactive aldehydes and ketones they produce, has been shown to chemically alter gelatin chains, which makes the gelatin more water-repellent [<xref rid="B9-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This modification also enhances the resulting gelatin film&#8217;s mechanical strength and its ability to act as a water-vapor barrier [<xref rid="B11-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A more recent study by Theerawitayaart et al. [<xref rid="B11-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] revealed that films made from gelatin that was chemically modified with oxidized linoleic acid (OLA) were more flexible and had a better water-vapor barrier than films where OLA was just directly added at low concentrations. The modified films also had better long-term stability, particularly in resisting yellow discoloration and rancidity [<xref rid="B12-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, a versatile, non-thermal method, has been used as a method for protein modification. This process enhances the barrier and mechanical characteristics of packaging films, particularly those made from gelatin and other biodegradable sources. The final effects of this modification are highly dependent on both the specific proteins and the methods used to create the films [<xref rid="B13-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. De Vargas et al. [<xref rid="B18-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] demonstrated that UV irradiation is a powerful treatment for inducing the cross-linking of gelatin chains, providing films with increased tensile strength and Young&#8217;s moduli but decreased elongation and water solubility. This irradiation method has been successfully used to enhance the functional properties of protein films by cross-linking mechanisms [<xref rid="B18-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Particularly, the electromagnetic radiation of UV is absorbed by double bonds and aromatic rings, causing free radical formation in amino acids. This can lead to the formation of intermolecular covalent bonds [<xref rid="B14-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>While previous studies have explored the use of UV irradiation for protein modification, and others have investigated the incorporation of lipids and oxidized lipids into gelatin films, there is a lack of information on the combined effect of these treatments. Specifically, the influence of modifying fish gelatin with fatty acids in the presence of a pro-oxidant like ferrous chloride (FeCl<sub>2</sub>) in combination with UV irradiation has not been thoroughly reported. The UV treatment of gelatin incorporated with fatty acids, especially in the presence of metal as a pro-oxidant, might enhance the oxidation of fatty acids. As a consequence, oxidized lipids induced by UV irradiation at an appropriate level might, in situ, modify gelatin via covalent attachment to gelatin molecules, thus affecting the properties of gelatin films, not only their water-barrier property but also other properties.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to represent an innovative approach by investigating the synergistic effects of UV irradiation and the incorporation of linoleic acid (LA) with ferrous chloride (FeCl<sub>2</sub>) as a pro-oxidant to enhance the functional properties of a biodegradable fish gelatin film. Particularly, the research aimed to evaluate the effects of the UV irradiation at different intensities and exposure times, by using two different methods, including applying UV to the film-forming solution before casting (S-UV) and to the pre-cast film (F-UV), on the properties and characteristics of final fish gelatin films containing LA without and with FeCl<sub>2</sub> addition. The film samples were analyzed for their physico-chemical properties, such as mechanical properties, water-vapor permeability, and optical properties, and some characteristics including molecular interactions via FTIR analysis, morphology, thermal properties, and protein pattern.</p><p>Overall, our findings demonstrate that the combination of UV irradiation with LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> significantly improves the film&#8217;s water-vapor barrier and mechanical properties, primarily due to enhanced cross-linking. The stage of UV treatment (before or after casting) had no significant impact on the film&#8217;s properties. In conclusion, this research provides a promising and effective method for creating enhanced-performance, bio-based packaging materials.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-polymers-17-02512"><title>2.

[<xref rid="B19-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Firstly, gelatin of a designated amount was mixed with distilled water to obtained a protein concentration of 3% (<italic toggle="yes">w</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>), and stirred continuously in a controlled-temperature water bath at 60 &#176;C for 30 min, followed by cooling down to room temperature.

After stirring for 30 min, the emulsions were placed in a vacuum pump (Diaphragm vacuum pump, Wertheim Germany) at room temperature for 30 min to remove air bubbles. The control gelatin film was formulated identically, with the exception of leaving out LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-polymers-17-02512"><title>2.3. Preparation of Gelatin Film Irradiated with UV</title><p>UV irradiation was implemented using two methods: (1) the FFS was irradiated prior to film casting (S-UV); (2) the pre-cast film was UV irradiated (post-film treatment) (F-UV). The UV chamber was equipped with a high-pressure mercury lamp (400 W) (Model 4/120, Brilliant Token Co., Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand), providing a wavelength of 365 nm. Before irradiation, the lamp was turned on for 15 min to warm up.</p><p>For the FFS UV treatment, the solutions were placed in the UV chamber at different distances from the UV lamps of 58, 40, 32, and 27 cm to obtain the intensities of 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, and 40,000 lux, respectively. The UV light&#8217;s intensity was measured using a digital lux meter (LX1010B, Hefei Vetus Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., Anhui, China). At each intensity, the FFS was irradiated for 1 and 5 min in air. After being irradiated under the designated condition, a precise amount of FFS (46.3 &#177; 0.01 g) was introduced to a square, rimmed, silicon resin substrate (17 &#215; 17 cm<sup>2</sup>) for molding. Subsequently, the casted FFS was air-blown at room temperature for 12 h to remove water. The films were placed in an environmental chamber (WTB Binder, Tuttlingen, Germany) to dry for 48 h. The drying conditions were maintained at 25 &#177; 0.5 &#176;C and 50 &#177; 5% relative humidity (RH). The resulting films were manually and carefully peeled off from the casting plate. Films obtained by this UV irradiation method were named &#8220;S-UV&#8221;.</p><p>For the pre-cast film UV treatment, the pre-cast films were irradiated by UV using the same intensity and exposure time.

The thickness value was slightly increased when LA was incorporated. No marked difference was found when FeCl<sub>2</sub> was added into films containing LA (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#8805; 0.05). The increased thickness might be related to the film-forming composition as associated with the increase in the solid content of the film [<xref rid="B27-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The LA used in the formulation mainly decreased the compactness of the polymer matrix, in which interaction and conjunction between protein molecules were impeded as indicated by the higher thickness. Small differences in thickness were observed between irradiated and non-irradiated films. Moreover, a similarity in thickness was observed between the S-UV and F-UV films.</p><p>The mechanical properties of the control as well as S-UV and F-UV films containing or not containing LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> are depicted in <xref rid="polymers-17-02512-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. The incorporation of LA increased the EAB while reducing the TS and EM of the resulting films compared to the control film (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). This effect was consistent across all films prepared by different UV treatment methods. The findings indicated that the addition of LA had a plasticizing effect since oil droplets might interfere with the close-knit interactions between gelatin chains, reducing their aggregation and crating more free volume within the film&#8217;s network [<xref rid="B27-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The disruption created a more pliable film, which was shown by its higher EAB but lower TS and EM. This observation aligned with previous work by Limpisophon et al. [<xref rid="B30-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] on gelatin films from blue shark skin. Chen et al.

This might result in the lowered TS and EAB as well as slightly decreased thickness. For films containing LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub>, in the presence of LA (30% (<italic toggle="yes">w</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">w</italic>) of protein), the incorporation of FeCl<sub>2</sub> increased the TS but decreased the EAB in comparison with that containing only LA (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). It was suggested that the addition of FeCl<sub>2</sub> to gelatin film containing LA could induce lipid oxidation and thus the formation of aldehyde moieties from lipid peroxidation such as malondialdehyde, hydroxynonenal, and acrolein. Those compounds could covalently bind to protein chains [<xref rid="B32-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Yamamoto et al. [<xref rid="B31-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] also reported that UV irradiation can induce both the scission and cross-linking of protein chains due to reactive species generated by oxidation reaction. At a high UV intensity, the oxidation of LA in the presence of a catalyst, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, took place and the aldehydes were formed to a higher extent. UV irradiation could induce the formation of bonds between the nuclei of aromatic residues, such as those of tyrosine and phenylalanine [<xref rid="B33-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

This observation indicates that UV irradiation more likely induced the cross-linking of film gelatin containing LA, especially in the presence of FeCl<sub>2</sub>.

The enhanced hydrophobicity of our films was also supported by Uchida et al.

This could enhance the cross-linking of protein in the film matrix, in comparison with a film without FeCl<sub>2</sub> added. The WVP of the film with higher cross-linking had a higher decrease in WVP. The gelatin film with strong interaction of protein molecules in the matrix more likely had compactness. Together with the increased hydrophobicity, this resulted in the lower migration of moisture through the film [<xref rid="B19-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. When comparing the effect of UV irradiation on the WVP of S-UV and F-UV films, there was no difference in WVP (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#8805; 0.05).

Similar results were reported for gelatin films in which various oils and fatty acids were incorporated [<xref rid="B7-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B19-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. On the other hand, substantial increases in a*- and b*-values with coincidentally lower L*-values were obtained for gelatin films supplemented with LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), compared with those of films from other treatments. It was suggested that the color of the films was significantly caused by FeCl<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>When UV irradiation was applied for either the FFS (S-UV) or pre-casted film (F-UV), the color was affected differently. The results showed that the b*- and a*-values were increased drastically when the exposure time and intensity of UV used for treatment increased (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Conversely, the L*-value decreased with increasing UV intensity and exposure time (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). This finding suggested that the UV irradiation of a gelatin film, regardless of the stage for irradiation, resulted in an alteration in the color of all the film samples, in which yellow or brown color was detected. This color change is a visible indicator of the chemical reactions taking place. Oxidative products including aldehydes, ketones, hydrocarbons, esters, lactones, and alcohols in oxidized oil or fats as induced by UV light could interact with amino groups of gelatins, thus causing glycation or Maillard reactions [<xref rid="B44-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The presence of these by-products from the cross-linking and protein glycation compounds were increased after UV treatment. Koh et al. [<xref rid="B45-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] described that an increase in the yellowness of oxidized linoleic acid and linolenic acid was probably due to the thermally induced oxidation of fatty acids. However, the effect of UV irradiation on color was slightly higher when the treatment was applied to the dry film (F-UV). Masutani et al. [<xref rid="B46-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] also documented a yellow color on the surface of gelatin films containing glucose subjected to UV irradiation. Therefore, both LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> together with UV irradiation were crucial factors affecting the appearance and color of the resulting gelatin films.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot4-polymers-17-02512"><title>3.1.4. Transparency Value</title><p>The transparency values of all the gelatin films as affected by the addition of LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> as well as exposure to UV radiation at different intensities and exposure times are depicted in <xref rid="polymers-17-02512-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>. The film sample supplemented with LA exhibited a higher transparency value than the control film (without LA) (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). A higher transparency value was found for the gelatin film when both LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> were added (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). This result indicated that the presence of fatty acids within the film matrix reduced the gelatin film&#8217;s transparency. The light-scattering effect caused by oil droplets significantly increased the film&#8217;s opacity. [<xref rid="B19-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This result was in line with Pires et al. [<xref rid="B47-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], who found that the incorporation of various essential oils (citronella, coriander, tarragon, and thyme oils) increased the transparency value of hake protein film. This confirms that the presence of lipid droplets causes a light-scattering effect, leading to reduced transparency.</p><p>The transparency value of the gelatin film increased and reached its highest value when irradiation was performed at 40,000 lux for 5 min, irrespective of the irradiation method (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The film&#8217;s transparency is influenced by its internal structure, as well as the amount and size of lipid aggregates that disperse within it during drying [<xref rid="B48-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Similarly, it is observed that S-UV films had higher transparency values than F-UV films. It was presumed that UV could penetrate into the FFS easily, thus inducing the formation of aldehydes, and generated more free radicals than in the dry film. These free radicals, in turn, formed the additional cross-links as evidenced by the higher transparency value (corresponding to a less transparent film). A lower transparency value was found when no UV irradiation was implemented, similar to that reported by Kristo et al. [<xref rid="B40-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-polymers-17-02512"><title>3.2. Characteristics of Fish Skin Gelatin Films with Incorporation of Linoleic Acid (LA) and Ferrous Chlorides (FeCl<sub>2</sub>) Subjected to UV Irradiation Under the Selected Conditions</title><p>Some characteristics were evaluated for the S-UV and F-UV films containing and not containing 30% LA and 30% LA + 1.5% FeCl<sub>2</sub>, which were irradiated at a selected UV-irradiation intensity and exposure time of 40,000 lux and 5 min, respectively. The control gelatin film without UV irradiation as well as LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> addition was also characterized for comparison. The obtained results are as follows:</p><sec id="sec3dot2dot1-polymers-17-02512"><title>3.2.1. Film Microstructure</title><p>The morphologies of the surfaces and cross-sections of selected gelatin films with and without UV treatment are illustrated in <xref rid="polymers-17-02512-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. Film samples treated with UV light, but without the addition of LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub>, had the smoothest and most uniform microstructure on both the surface and in cross-section compared to all the other UV-treated films. These films generally showed similar microstructures to the control film without UV treatment. However, adding LA to the film without FeCl<sub>2</sub> resulted in the roughest surface. The film&#8217;s surface and cross-section also showed a high concentration of tiny droplets and pinholes. This result indicated that roughness was more likely due to the aggregation of lipid droplets.</p><p>The film containing FeCl<sub>2</sub> as an oxidizing agent in the film sample and supplemented with LA exhibited a smoother surface without any voids and a dense structure on cross-section, compared with the film in which only LA was incorporated, followed by UV treatment. Overall, it had a similar surface microstructure to the control film (without LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> added). This result suggested that UV irradiation at high intensity and for sufficient time could induce interaction and cross-linking, especially when FeCl<sub>2</sub> was introduced. As a result, the film matrix could be stabilized by a combination reaction including photo cross-linking, or intercross-linking may happen between the neighboring polymeric molecules [<xref rid="B49-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The difference in structure between the UV-treated films without and with FeCl<sub>2</sub> as an oxidizing agent could result from oxidatively induced interactions and cross-linking possibly occurring in the film matrix. Higher cross-linking between lipid oxidation products or generated radicals and gelatin molecules were found in the film prepared using FeCl<sub>2</sub>. The S-UV film containing LA + FeCl<sub>2</sub> (S-UV3) had a more homogenous appearance of the surface and denser structure than the F-UV3 film. Thus, the microstructure of the film matrix was likely affected by molecular interactions in the gelatin films as governed by the different components used and UV irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot2-polymers-17-02512"><title>3.2.2. ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy</title><p><xref rid="polymers-17-02512-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> illustrates the ATR-FTIR spectra of selected UV-irradiated gelatin films and the control gelatin film without UV irradiation and LA + FeCl<sub>2</sub> addition. An FTIR measurement was performed to identify the chemical groups as well as possible chemical interactions and bonds responsible for the structural stabilization of the gelatin film matrix. The typical spectra characteristic of protein-based materials was generally observed in all the film samples. The absorbance bands of the fish gelatin film contained a series of the major bands at ~3280 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (amide-A, illustrating NH-stretching, coupled with hydrogen bonding), ~3079 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (representing stretching of CH in =CH or aromatic moiety and NH<sup>3+</sup>), ~2935 and 2867 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (amide-B, corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric stretching of aliphatic CH, respectively), ~1634 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (amide-I, representing the C=O stretching/hydrogen bonding coupled with COO-), ~1523 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (amide-II, illustrating the NH bending coupled with CN stretching), and ~1234 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (amide-III, representing the CN and NH in plane of amide bound or CH<sub>2</sub> of glycine) [<xref rid="B50-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The typical bands found in all the gelatin films aligned with those reported by Tongnuanchan et al. [<xref rid="B19-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B27-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It could be noticed from the spectra that the amide-A band (~3290 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) of UV-treated films generally showed a slight shift to lower wavenumbers (~3288&#8211;3285 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) with a concomitant decrease in peak intensity as compared to the control film (untreated film). For the amide-B band (at ~2935 and ~2867 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), a higher peak amplitude was observed in UV-irradiated films containing LA (S-UV2, F-UV2) and LA + FeCl<sub>2</sub> (S-UV3, F-UV3), which was more intense in the later film samples, in comparison with the control film. The wavenumbers at ~2935 and ~2867 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> were generally related to alkyl groups and were also reported to correlate with the increased hydrophobicity of molecules [<xref rid="B51-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Similar results were observed by Wu et al. [<xref rid="B52-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], who pointed out that the presence of LA under UV irradiation could enhance the presence of hydrophobic groups in the gelatin film. In addition, irrespective of the irradiation method, the incorporation of FeCl<sub>2</sub> into films containing LA that were treated with UV could further enhance the interaction and cross-linking between gelatin chains, possibly induced by UV&#8211;oxidative reactions. This could consequently decrease hydrophilic moieties and hence increase the hydrophobicity of the films. These results align with the WVP decrease observed in S-UV and F-UV films that incorporated LA + FeCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="polymers-17-02512-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In the amide-I and -II regions, a shift to lower wavenumbers for these peaks could be noticed for films with UV irradiation, regardless of LA and LA + FeCl<sub>2</sub> addition. A remarkable shift of amide-II to lower wavenumbers (1544 to 1528 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) was observed for the S-UV-treated gelatin film with the incorporation of LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> (S-UV3). The shift in the amide-I and -II peaks of gelatin could relate to the conformational change involving the helix&#8211;coil structure as well as the formation of hydrogen bonding and other kinds of bonding and interaction [<xref rid="B52-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Furthermore, the intensity of the amide-II peak decreased when UV irradiation was implemented, irrespective of the S-UV and F-UV methods, especially in the films with LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> addition. The decrease in the intensity of amide-I, amide-II, and amide-A could suggest that UV treatment affected the interaction of amino groups as well as amide carbonyl groups and induced the cross-linking of proteins [<xref rid="B15-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The shifts in amide-I and amide-II peaks and the decrease in their intensity, which was attributed to UV-induced cross-linking and interaction with lipid oxidation products, were consistent with the findings of other studies on protein modification. For instance, a decrease in the intensity of amide-I and amide-II peaks after UV treatment was also reported by Wang et al. [<xref rid="B53-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] for fish gelatin films, supporting our conclusion that UV irradiation promotes protein cross-linking.</p><p>The increase in cross-linking might be due to the generated peroxide radicals and other reactive species [<xref rid="B54-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Generally, LA is prone to oxidation due to the presence of double bonds. Similarly, the double bonds and aromatic rings in amino acids like tyrosine and phenylalanine can absorb UV radiation. This absorption can generate free radicals, leading to the formation of intermolecular covalent bonds [<xref rid="B13-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, it could be noticed that the F-UV film containing LA + FeCl<sub>2</sub> (F-UV3) showed not only a remarkable reduction in the intensity of amide-I and II but also a significant increase in the intensity of the peak in the wavenumber range of 1455&#8211;1400 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, characteristic of the C-N bond, when compared to other samples. This could be indicative for additional covalent cross-linking possibly mediated via bonding between the carbon atoms of reactive species generated from lipid oxidation and the NH group of gelatins. It should be noted that the incorporation of FeCl<sub>2</sub>, a pro-oxidant, in the film was accompanied by an increase in cross-linking between gelatin and LA molecules, particularly when the film was exposed to UV irradiation. This was likely due to covalent bond formation between the &#612;-carbonyl group in LA residues and the &#400;-amino group of a lysine residue [<xref rid="B9-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This obtained result strongly supported the highest increase in strength and decrease in WVP found in the S-UV film containing LA + FeCl<sub>2</sub> compared to other films (<xref rid="polymers-17-02512-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="polymers-17-02512-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the existence of a peak at around 1715&#8211;1765 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> was observed in LA-supplemented films with UV irradiation. This peak was more likely caused by the stretching vibration of the C=O in aldehydes or carbonyl-containing species [<xref rid="B55-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] generated from UV-induced oxidation. This was more pronounced when FeCl<sub>2</sub> was incorporated. These reactive species could undergo reactions with gelatin, resulting in the cross-linking of gelatin. In general, the FTIR spectra of films prepared by different UV irradiation methods (S-UV and F-UV) were very similar. However, the changes, such as the shift and decrease in the intensity of amide-I and amide-II as well as the increase in the intensity of the peak around 1455&#8211;1400 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, were more pronounced and clearly noticed in S-UV films, especially with FeCl<sub>2</sub> addition. In the solution state, the molecules had higher mobility and the UV radiation applied might have been able to penetrate into the film-forming solution easily. This could have induced the formation of aldehydes and generated more free-radicals than in the dry film. Correspondingly, the cross-linking of gelatin induced by oxidation and UV irradiation could take place to a higher extent in the film-forming solution as compared to the dry film of gelatin. Therefore, the incorporation of LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> followed by UV irradiation could provide hydrophobic groups and induce protein cross-linking in the resulting films. The more hydrophobic substance resulted in a decrease in the WVP of the film. Similarly, the higher interaction between proteins in the fish gelatin film matrix might be one of the major causes of the increases in TS and EM.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot3-polymers-17-02512"><title>3.2.3.

The temperature of degradation, weight loss, and residue mass are provided in <xref rid="polymers-17-02512-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The TGA thermogram of all the samples generally exhibited three zones of weight loss. Those changes included the first step, in a temperature range of 50.72&#8211;58.47 &#176;C (T<sub>d1</sub>) with a weight loss of 4.07&#8211;9.20% (&#8710;w<sub>1</sub>); the second step, in a temperature range of 193.25&#8211;246.38 &#176;C (T<sub>d2</sub>) with a weight loss of 12.35&#8211;30.44% (&#8710;w<sub>2</sub>); and the third step, in a temperature range of 316.10&#8211;382.80 &#176;C (T<sub>d3</sub>) with a weight loss of 42.15&#8211;62.32% (&#8710;w<sub>3</sub>). The first stage of weight reduction observed in all the films was mostly linked to the loss of moisture and other low-molecular-weight volatile compounds within their structure. This initial weight loss ascribed to the evaporation of free water was typically observed in various bio-based films including from gelatin [<xref rid="B27-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It was noticed that films supplemented with LA and subjected to UV irradiation had lower weight loss than the control film (w/o UV), caused by the presence of a hydrophobic substance in the film [<xref rid="B27-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], especially when FeCl<sub>2</sub> was present.</p><p>The second weight loss periods of all the films were detected in a temperature range of 193.25&#8211;246.38 &#176;C (T<sub>d2</sub>), with a weight loss of 12.35&#8211;30.44% (&#8710;w<sub>2</sub>). This degradation temperature could result from the decomposition of the gelatin film matrix and the constituents, more likely the small molecule fractions.</p><p>The thermal stability of the gelatin film was compromised by the loss of its glycerol plasticizer and the degradation of a low-molecular-weight protein [<xref rid="B56-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Similarly, Tongnuanchan et al. [<xref rid="B18-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found that adding citrus essential oil to fish skin gelatin films led to reduced degradation temperatures and increased weight loss compared to pure gelatin films. For UV-treated samples, a lower T<sub>d2</sub> degradation temperature was found, compared to the control film (w/o UV). The UV treatment might have caused the oxidative degradation of gelatin chains to the same degree as well as generating reactive lipid oxidation products with small molecules, especially when LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> were incorporated. These low-molecular-weight fractions produced in the UV-treated films could be thermally degraded at a lower T<sub>d2</sub> temperature compared to those of the control film without UV treatment. The temperature range for the third step of thermal degradation (T<sub>d3</sub>) appeared at 316.10&#8211;382.80 &#176;C with a weight loss (&#8710;w<sub>3</sub>) of 42.15&#8211;62.32%, suggesting the depolymerization of a large molecule fraction of gelatin chains in the film network. A higher degradation temperature and weight loss in this T<sub>d3</sub> range were obtained in UV-exposed films with LA incorporation, especially when FeCl<sub>2</sub> was incorporated, indicating that the film structure was more thermo-stable than the other films. The formation of thermo-stable fractions was mostly correlated with the oxidation induced by UV irradiation. FeCl<sub>2</sub> could increase the oxidation of LA, leading to enhanced cross-linking between LA and gelatin chains, possibly involving covalent bonds, in which a strong matrix was formed. The covalent cross-linked fractions with thermal resistance could be formed to a higher extent in the UV-treated film containing LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> as a pro-oxidant, resulting in the highest T<sub>d3</sub> of this film. This was also in accordance with the highest residue mass (representing char content) observed in the UV-treated film containing LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub>, compared with the other films. The film containing both LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> had the highest lipid oxidation products or radicals, which could lead to the cross-linking of protein in the film matrix, as evidenced by the IR result (<xref rid="polymers-17-02512-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, the use of UV treatment for a gelatin film containing both LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> had a marked impact on the thermal degradation behavior and stability of the resulting gelatin film.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot4-polymers-17-02512"><title>3.2.4.

Generally, the primary components found in fish skin gelatin are the &#945;<sub>1</sub>- and &#945;<sub>2</sub>-chains [<xref rid="B57-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. For films prepared from the FFS subjected to UV light before casting (S-UV), the protein pattern of gelatin films without and with LA after UV irradiation (S-UV1 and S-UV2) was slightly different from that of the control film. The band intensities of the &#945;<sub>1</sub>- and &#945;<sub>2</sub>-chains were much lower, compared with those found for the control film. The data suggested that UV irradiation can induce cross-linking in the film matrix, leading to an augmentation in the molecular weight of the proteins in the resulting gelatin film. There was no marked difference in protein pattern between the film prepared from the FFS subjected to UV irradiation in the absence (S-UV1) and presence of LA (S-UV2). The results indicated that the addition of LA into the gelatin film-forming solution followed by UV treatment had no effect on the increase in the molecular weight of the gelatin in the film. However, drastic differences in protein patterns were observed between the film from the FFS containing LA (S-UV2) and film containing LA + FeCl<sub>2</sub> (S-UV3) after UV treatment, by the disappearance of the bands of &#945;<sub>1</sub>- and &#945;<sub>2</sub>-chains. This phenomenon was owing to the enhanced cross-linking of gelatin in the film matrix via non-disulfide covalent bonds. FeCl<sub>2</sub> was able to induce LA oxidation via UV irradiation. The cross-link formation in irradiated proteins significantly affected the structural organization of macromolecules [<xref rid="B58-polymers-17-02512" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>In general, the stage or method of UV irradiation (S-UV and F-UV) had no profound impact on the protein pattern of the resulting films.

Therefore, LA in combination with FeCl<sub>2</sub> could induce non-disulfide covalent bonds between &#945;-chains of gelatin, causing the changes in the properties of the resulting gelatin films.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-polymers-17-02512"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>The incorporation of both LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> significantly improved the water-vapor barrier property, while mechanical performance was also enhanced through UV irradiation. This was mainly associated with the increased protein cross-linking from non-disulfide covalent bonds. However, the yellowness of the treated film was increased, whereas the film became less transparent. The stage of UV irradiation had no influence on the properties of the film; therefore, it could be implemented in either the film-forming solution or the pre-cast film. Based on the improved properties, the developed gelatin films show great potential for application as food packaging materials. These films are particularly suitable for packaging dry and high-fat foods, such as nuts, dried fruits, potato chips, crackers, and fatty powders, helping to extend their shelf life. The increased mechanical strength also makes the films more durable and resistant to handling during storage and transport. Considering the trade-off between properties, the incorporation of LA and FeCl<sub>2</sub> into a fish gelatin film that is UV irradiated at an intensity of 40,000 lux for 5 min in the film-forming solution prior to casting is suggested to improve the water-vapor barrier property of the fish gelatin film for these specific food packaging applications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the research facility supported by the International Center of Excellence in Seafood Science and Innovation, Faculty of Agro-Industry, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Thailand.
