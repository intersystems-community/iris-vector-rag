Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine primarily involved in immune regulation, has recently been identified as a key player in cardiovascular health. However, its role in modulating inflammation and fibrosis after AMI is not fully understood. This study investigates how TSLP mediates anti-inflammatory effects and reduces fibrosis, ultimately improving heart function in a mouse model of AMI. We established a TSLP knockout mouse strain and performed left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation to create an AMI model. This was used to investigate the role of TSLP in eosinophil (EOS) recruitment and fibrosis alleviation. Additionally, EOS depletion, JAK-STAT pathway inhibition, and ferroptosis were employed to analyze potential mediating factors. The extent of cardiac tissue fibrosis was evaluated using histological staining. Inflammatory cytokine levels and EOS were assessed through ELISA and flow cytometry. Western blotting was conducted to detect proteins related to ferroptosis and the JAK-STAT pathway. TSLP deficiency significantly exacerbated myocardial remodeling in AMI mice, while TSLP treatment markedly reduced cardiac fibrosis following AMI, with a notable decrease in collagen deposition within the heart tissue. In Transwell assays, TSLP effectively recruited EOSs, and in vivo experiments demonstrated that TSLP promoted the resolution of acute-phase inflammation (within one week), a process that could be blocked by EOS depletion. TSLP promotes the resolution of post-infarction inflammation and inhibits fibrosis by recruiting EOSs to the heart. This highlights the potential of targeting the TSLP-EOS axis as a therapeutic strategy to improve cardiac function and reduce post-AMI complications.</p><sec><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="Par2"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="anchor" id="d33e204" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="10495_2025_2137_Figa_HTML.jpg"/>This schematic illustrates the role of TSLP in regulating eosinophil (EOS) recruitment and protecting cardiomyocytes following acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

In contrast, TSLP supplementation inhibits the JAK1 pathway, promotes EOS recruitment, downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, restores mitochondrial structural integrity, and suppresses ferroptosis by upregulating SLC7A11 and glutathione (GSH) synthesis, thereby facilitating optimal fibrotic repair.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)</kwd><kwd>TSLP</kwd><kwd>EOS</kwd><kwd>JAK-STAT pathway</kwd><kwd>Ferroptosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100014717</institution-id><institution>National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82100281</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yunzhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Medical Science and Technique Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>11560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yunzhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Henan Provincial Medical Science and Technology Research Joint Venture Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>71113, LHGJ20200362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yunzhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a severe cardiovascular disease caused by insufficient myocardial blood supply due to atherosclerosis or coronary artery stenosis, as well as other stressors leading to relative myocardial hypoxia and ultimately resulting in myocardial cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The occurrence of AMI not only induces acute myocardial cell damage but also triggers complex immune responses that affect the structure and function of the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the acute phase of AMI, the death of myocardial cells initiates an immune response that activates the inflammatory polarization of resident cardiac immune cells while recruiting more circulating immune cells to the site of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by necrotic myocardial cells bind to specific pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the surface of inflammatory cells and interact with other surviving myocardial cells, thereby triggering an inflammatory cascade reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The inflammatory response has a dual role in AMI. On one hand, moderate inflammation helps to clear necrotic cells and tissue debris, creating conditions for myocardial repair; on the other hand, excessive or persistent inflammation can lead to myocardial fibrosis and remodeling, exacerbating cardiac dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the role of immune cells after AMI is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="Par4">Eosinophils (EOS) are a type of granulocytic leukocyte with a segmented nucleus that play a crucial role in immune defense, particularly in resisting parasitic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and regulating allergic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Their densely packed granules contain various cationic proteins, including major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), which contribute to their immune functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. After eliminating parasites and pathogens, EOS promote the repair of damaged tissues in organs such as the lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract by releasing growth factors like transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#946;) and other regulatory factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, EOS have a significant role in allergic reactions, especially in diseases like asthma and allergic rhinitis. When allergens are present, EOS accumulate in tissues and release inflammatory mediators, leading to tissue damage, edema, and increased mucus secretion, highlighting their recruitment responsiveness, pro-inflammatory, and pro-fibrotic capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that abnormal accumulation of eosinophils (EOS) in the heart can lead to myocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, recent findings suggest that EOS recruited during myocardial infarction exert beneficial effects on cardiac repair, highlighting a complex and context-dependent relationship between EOS and heart diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, the role of EOS in AMI remains controversial. Some studies have indicated that elevated EOS targeting the heart can lead to progressive myocardial damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], while other studies support that EOS have a positive effect on cardiac function in experimental AMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This discrepancy may be related to the multifunctionality of EOS and the complexity of the cardiac microenvironment.</p><p id="Par5">Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an IL-7-like cytokine mainly expressed by epithelial cells. Under inflammatory conditions, other cells such as macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts can also produce TSLP. As the name suggests, TSLP was initially discovered as a growth factor derived from the supernatant of a mouse thymic stromal cell line, found to promote the survival and proliferation of B lymphocytes. Subsequent studies revealed that TSLP can mediate allergic reactions and is an effective target for treating asthma and atopic dermatitis. TSLP not only acts on B lymphocytes but also regulates the functions of dendritic cells and T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Currently, studies on the role of TSLP in cardiovascular diseases are relatively limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], especially regarding how it regulates EOS migration and function in myocardial remodeling after AMI. Given the key role of TSLP in allergic inflammation and EOS recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], we hypothesize that TSLP may influence the process of myocardial remodeling after AMI by regulating the migration and function of EOS.</p><p id="Par6">This study aims to investigate the function and potential mechanisms of TSLP in regulating EOS migration during myocardial remodeling after AMI, providing new insights for immunoregulatory therapy post-AMI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical sample collection</title><p id="Par7">Clinical imaging data and blood samples were collected from patients at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University.

The results demonstrated that TSLP underwent a sharp increase following AMI, followed by a gradual decrease over a two-week period (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). To determine the source of TSLP, we performed immunofluorescence staining for TSLP and the myocardial marker cTnT on heart tissue sections. Compared with the sham-operated (Sham) group, overall TSLP protein expression was significantly elevated in the hearts of AMI mice and exhibited clear colocalization with cardiac troponin T (cTnT)-positive myocardial cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). These findings indicate that, after AMI, myocardial cells within the infarct region secrete TSLP, which largely accounts for the elevated circulating TSLP levels observed.</p><p id="Par19">To further investigate the function of TSLP in AMI, we designed four distinct TSLP-knockout strategies (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F) and selected the most efficient design to generate TSLP-KO mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G). Tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining of excised hearts confirmed successful infarction, with infarcted regions appearing white while the non-infarcted myocardium remained red. Notably, the infarcted area near the apex of the left ventricular anterolateral wall was significantly larger in the AMI group compared with the sham-operated group (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>H). These data confirm the efficacy of our AMI model and establish a foundational platform for elucidating TSLP&#8217;s role in post-infarction cardiac remodeling and recovery.</p><p id="Par20">Echocardiographic assessments conducted before and after AMI induction in the same subjects exhibited classical features of AMI and subsequent heart failure. These features included reduced ventricular wall thickness, dilated interventricular septum, and decreased heart rate, as demonstrated by M-mode ultrasound imaging (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>I). Additionally, serum biomarkers of cardiac injury&#8212;cardiac troponin I (cTnI), cTnT, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)&#8212;were significantly elevated in the AMI model, corroborating the presence of myocardial damage (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>J).</p><p id="Par21">In summary, the data indicate a potential interaction between increased TSLP protein expression and the occurrence of AMI, as well as subsequent ventricular remodeling.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining showed that sham-operated mice exhibited intact cardiac architecture with orderly arranged cardiomyocytes. In contrast, AMI-induced WT mice displayed disrupted myocardial structure, characterized by disorganized cardiomyocyte alignment and prominent inflammatory cell infiltration with multinucleated cells. Notably, TSLP-KO mice exhibited more pronounced myocardial injury, including expanses of necrotic tissue stained brick-red and devoid of intact cellular structures (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). To further assess collagen deposition, Sirius Red staining demonstrated that normal WT myocardium primarily exhibited yellow staining, indicating minimal collagen content. However, both TSLP-KO and WT mice subjected to AMI showed substantially increased Sirius Red&#8211;positive (red) areas, corroborating the presence of augmented collagen fibers (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Consistent with these findings, Masson&#8217;s trichrome staining revealed that TSLP-KO mice experienced more pronounced fibrotic remodeling (blue staining) compared to WT mice after AMI. Intriguingly, mild fibrotic changes were observed in TSLP-KO mice even prior to AMI induction, suggesting an inherent heightened sensitivity to hypoxic or inflammatory stimuli that leads to the accumulation of pathological changes independent of acute ischemic events (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C).<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;2</label><caption><p>TSLP deficiency exacerbates AMI-induced fibrosis and damage.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) quantification revealed that levels of ICAM-1, MMP-9, and C5a were significantly elevated in both WT and TSLP-KO mice following AMI. Moreover, the increases in these inflammatory markers were more pronounced in TSLP-KO mice compared to WT controls (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). These results suggest a protective role for TSLP in modulating the inflammatory response following AMI, with its absence leading to exacerbated inflammation and subsequent tissue damage. Further ELISA analyses were performed to measure cytokines predominantly produced by immune cells. interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1&#946; (IL-1&#946;), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&#945;) levels were markedly elevated in both WT and TSLP-KO mice post-AMI.

TSLP knockdown resulted in a significant reduction in ECP and E-selectin levels. In contrast to the increased expression of ICAM-1, E-selectin levels were decreased in TSLP-KO mice, indicating a disruption in leukocyte recruitment and retention post-AMI. Given that E-selectin is crucial for the early stages of leukocyte recruitment and ICAM-1 functions in the later stages, the observed increase in ICAM-1 may represent a compensatory mechanism for the reduced E-selectin-mediated recruitment. Additionally, the decrease in ECP suggests a reduction in EOS presence and impaired recruitment to the infarcted myocardium.</p><p id="Par26">These findings imply that TSLP deficiency disrupts normal leukocyte recruitment dynamics following AMI, contributing to impaired tissue repair and increased fibrosis. The association between reduced ECP levels and the mild fibrotic phenotype observed in TSLP-KO mice prior to AMI, as well as enhanced fibrosis and decreased tissue elasticity post-AMI, warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>TSLP-mediated EOS recruitment and cardiomyocyte protection</title><p id="Par27">To further elucidate the immune cell landscape in myocardial tissues following AMI, we extracted RNA from the hearts of WT and TSLP-KO mice after surgery and constructed cDNA libraries for quantitative PCR (qPCR).

A Transwell assay was employed, with EOS seeded in the upper chamber and cardiomyocytes co-cultured with gradient concentrations of purified TSLP protein in the lower chamber. After 8&#160;h of incubation, flow cytometry analysis revealed that in the absence of TSLP, EOS migration toward the lower chamber was minimal. TSLP induced EOS migration in a dose-dependent manner, although its chemotactic effect plateaued at higher concentrations, suggesting a non-linear recruitment response (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). To visualize EOS localization, poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips placed in the lower chamber were fixed and subjected to immunofluorescence staining.

We treated myocardial cells with TNF&#945; to simulate the pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic microenvironment characteristic of AMI. Concurrently, EOL1 cells were treated with TSLP, and the resulting conditioned medium was applied to AC16 cells. Hoechst staining, CFDA staining, and propidium iodide (PI) staining demonstrated that TNF&#945; significantly increased myocardial cell death. In contrast, conditioned medium from TSLP-treated EOL1 cells markedly reduced TNF&#945;-induced apoptosis in AC16 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D).</p><p id="Par30">To assess oxidative stress, we utilized the BODIPY 581/591 C11 probe, which emits red fluorescence in its non-oxidized state and green fluorescence upon oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Treatment with conditioned medium from TSLP-activated EOL1 cells significantly attenuated ROS accumulation in AC16 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E). Given the observed increase in ROS levels in myocardial cells following TNF&#945; treatment, and considering that mitochondria are the primary source of intracellular ROS, we hypothesized that mitochondrial integrity is compromised under these conditions. To evaluate mitochondrial viability, we employed the MitoTracker-red probe in AC16 myocardial cells subjected to TNF&#945; treatment. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a significant reduction in MitoTracker-positive cells in the TNF&#945;-treated group compared to controls, indicating impaired mitochondrial function. Importantly, treatment with conditioned medium from TSLP-activated EOL1 EOS partially preserved MitoTracker-red fluorescence, suggesting a protective effect of TSLP-mediated EOS activation on mitochondrial integrity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F).</p><p id="Par31">Autophagy was evaluated using Acridine Orange staining, which fluoresces green under neutral pH and red within acidic autolysosomes.

Intracellular iron levels were also elevated in response to TNF&#945; stimulation, indicating enhanced lipid peroxidation and iron overload. In contrast, supernatants derived from TSLP-stimulated EOS suppressed ACSL4 expression and MDA accumulation, restored GPX4 expression, and replenished GSH levels, thereby mitigating iron dyshomeostasis and ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>H, I).</p><p id="Par33">Collectively, these findings indicate that TSLP facilitates the recruitment and activation of eosinophils, which in turn confer protective effects on myocardial cells.

Specifically, we induced AMI in WT mice and manipulated EOS levels via a Siglec-F antibody (to deplete eosinophils) and/or applied TSLP treatment. Sirius Red staining revealed that, consistent with our prior observations, cardiac tissue in the control group (AMI without intervention) was prone to fragmentation during section preparation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). EOS depletion (Siglec-F Ab) led to an increased Sirius Red-positive area, indicative of enhanced collagen fiber deposition. In contrast, TSLP administration preserved a substantial portion of the yellow (collagen-negative) regions, implying reduced collagen deposition. Mice treated with both Siglec-F Ab and TSLP exhibited an intermediate phenotype, suggesting that TSLP can partially compensate for the loss of eosinophils. H&amp;E staining showed that the control group harbored aggregations of eosinophilic (red) fibers lacking nuclei, while the eosinophil-depleted group displayed fewer nuclei overall (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). TSLP-treated mice demonstrated lighter red staining, reflecting diminished necrotic regions. Notably, tissues from mice receiving both Siglec-F Ab and TSLP shifted toward a more normal appearance than tissues subjected to EOS depletion alone. Similar trends were observed with Masson&#8217;s trichrome staining, which labels collagen fibers in blue (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C).<fig id="Fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;6</label><caption><p>TSLP reduces AMI-induced fibrosis and elastic changes by inhibiting JAK-STAT-mediated ferroptosis. <bold>A</bold>&#8211;<bold>D</bold> Wild-type mice underwent AMI modeling and were treated with Siglec-F antibody and/or TSLP. <bold>A</bold> Sirius red staining. <bold>B</bold> H&amp;E staining. <bold>C</bold> Masson&#8217;s trichrome staining. <bold>D</bold> Western blot results of ferroptosis-related protein ACSL4 and JAK-STAT pathway proteins p-JAK1, JAK1, and STAT5. <bold>E</bold>&#8211;<bold>G</bold> TSLP-KO mice were subjected to AMI modeling and treated with JAKi and/or Fer-1. <bold>E</bold> Sirius red staining. <bold>F</bold> H&amp;E staining. <bold>G</bold> Masson&#8217;s trichrome staining. ns: not significant; *<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05, **<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01, ***<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e850" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="10495_2025_2137_Fig6_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par44">Immunostaining of ferroptosis-related proteins and JAK-STAT pathway components revealed that TSLP administration reduced both ferroptosis and JAK1 phosphorylation&#8211;driven pathway activation, in contrast to the effects of EOS depletion (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D).

Our findings suggest that a combinatorial therapeutic approach targeting TSLP-mediated EOS recruitment and associated inflammatory and cell death pathways may offer significant clinical benefits in accelerating the resolution of inflammation and improving cardiac outcomes following AMI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par52">In this study, we investigated the role of TSLP, a key immunoregulatory cytokine in AMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While the involvement of TSLP in allergic diseases and epithelial defense is well-established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], its function in cardiovascular diseases, particularly in AMI, remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our findings demonstrate that TSLP exerts a protective effect in AMI by promoting the EOS recruitment, thereby mitigating excessive inflammatory responses and reducing myocardial fibrosis. These results provide new insights into the role of the immune system in post-AMI cardiac remodeling and suggest that TSLP could serve as a promising therapeutic target.</p><p id="Par53">AMI triggers a robust immune response characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages into the damaged myocardium. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of EOS in post-AMI repair and remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], challenging the traditional view that excessive EOS infiltration leads to eosinophilic myocarditis, a rare form of cardiac damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our results reveal that TSLP protein levels are elevated during the acute phase of AMI, and through the regulation of EOS recruitment and activation, TSLP exerts anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects, reduces ROS levels, and inhibits excessive autophagy and ferroptosis. In TSLP-knockout mice, we observed more severe cardiac remodeling and fibrosis, along with significantly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1&#946;, and TNF&#945;. These findings suggest that TSLP protects cardiac function by limiting excessive inflammatory responses, supporting the hypothesis that EOS play a role in resolving inflammation and limiting fibrosis in AMI.</p><p id="Par54">Furthermore, our study reveals that TSLP acts as an upstream regulator of EOS activity, playing a crucial role in AMI. The differential effects of EOS in different stages of AMI, as well as the complexity of the myocardial microenvironment, may account for these findings. EOS are known to release the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], serving as a feedback mechanism to modulate excessive immune responses. In environments where EOS are not the dominant immune cell population, the immunosuppressive effects of eosinophil-derived cytokines may exert greater influence over other immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This may explain why EOS&#8217;s anti-inflammatory effects outweigh their pro-inflammatory characteristics in specific immune contexts. Additionally, EOS exhibit plasticity, undergoing transcriptional changes that promote anti-inflammatory functions, such as tissue repair and cell migration, upon interacting with apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Apoptotic cells enhance EOS responses to IL-4, inducing a transcriptomic profile associated with tissue repair and remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Previous literature indicates that TSLPR is a cytokine receptor associated with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], a key mediator of inflammatory responses. Unexpectedly, our findings demonstrate that TSLP reduces JAK1 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes, suggesting a negative correlation between TSLP expression and activation of the JAK1/STAT5 pathway. This observation raises the possibility that TSLP may function as a negative regulator of this signaling cascade. We acknowledge that the incorporation of high-throughput or direct mechanistic data&#8212;such as RNA sequencing or phosphoproteomic profiling&#8212;would further strengthen the validity of this conclusion. Notably, both TSLP and IL-7 utilize IL-7R&#945; as a shared receptor subunit, raising the possibility of receptor-level crosstalk or competition. TSLP forms a high-affinity signaling complex by binding to TSLPR and subsequently recruiting IL-7R&#945; (KD &#8776; 29&#160;nM), while IL-7 binds to IL-7R&#945; and the common &#947;-chain with comparatively lower affinity. Structural analyses suggest that under conditions of elevated TSLP expression, TSLP may sequester IL-7R&#945; and thereby interfere with IL-7&#8211;mediated signaling&#8212;a form of competitive inhibition at the receptor level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Based on this, we hypothesize that elevated levels of TSLP may competitively inhibit IL-7&#8211;mediated activation of the JAK1/STAT5 pathway. This mechanism may have functional implications in tissues where both cytokines are co-expressed, including the inflamed myocardium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In parallel, ferroptosis has been increasingly recognized as a critical contributor to hypoxia&#8211;reperfusion injury, with mounting evidence supporting its involvement in AMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. As such, targeting ferroptosis has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to improve AMI outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Our findings indicate that TSLP suppresses ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes, suggesting that its cardioprotective effects extend beyond inflammation regulation and involve ferroptosis inhibition. This introduces a novel link between immune modulation and regulated cell death.</p><p id="Par56">The significance of our study lies in two key aspects. First, we demonstrate that TSLP has therapeutic potential following AMI, as it reduces inflammation and fibrosis by modulating the protective function of EOS, thereby preserving cardiac function. Second, we uncover the critical role of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in ferroptosis during AMI, suggesting that targeting this pathway could prevent ferroptosis and improve AMI prognosis. Future studies should further explore the molecular signaling pathways between TSLP, EOS, and cardiomyocytes. Moreover, investigating TSLP's role in human AMI cases is essential to determine whether similar protective effects exist. Finally, exploring the potential of combining TSLP with ferroptosis inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy may offer more effective treatment options for AMI. In conclusion, our research demonstrates that TSLP mediates cardioprotection by regulating EOS, inhibiting ferroptosis, and improving post-AMI cardiac remodeling. These findings provide new insights into the immune regulatory mechanisms following AMI and offer a novel therapeutic target for improving patient outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Yunzhe Wang and Chenxi Cao have contributed equally to this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors contributions</title><p>Yunzhe Wang, Jinying Zhang and Gangqiong Liu conceived, designed, and supervised the whole study; Chenxi Cao, Tinglan Fu, Fengyi Yu and Jinyue Qi operated the experiment, performed the analyses, and audited the data; Chenxi Cao wrote the manuscript; Jinying Zhang and Gangqiong Liu revised the manuscript.
