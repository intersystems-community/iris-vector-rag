<xref rid="bibr1-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup> Depending on their content, fluid collections are classified as seroma, abscess, lymphocele, hematoma, or biloma.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="bibr3-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr4-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="bibr5-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Most intra-abdominal abscesses occur after a surgical procedure, and the abovementioned types of fluid collections can evolve into an abscess if they become infected. Although intra-abdominal abscesses most often occur secondary to gastric and intestinal surgery, other surgical interventions, including partial hepatectomy, pancreatectomy, and pelvic surgical procedures, can also lead to abscess formation. Hematomas, caused by intra-abdominal bleeding from lesions such as tubo-ovarian abscess or hemorrhagic corpus luteum cysts, are also common causes of pelvic fluid collection.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr6-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup></p><p>Ultrasonography is the first-line imaging modality for evaluating abdominal fluid collections. Hematomas may have different sonographic appearances, depending on the age of blood products.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr7-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup> Hematomas are anechoic in the acute phase but may become echogenic after organization and clot formation. During clot lysis, they appear heterogeneously hypoechogenic. After lysis is complete, they may appear anechoic again. Intra-abdominal abscesses usually present with irregular thick walls, heterogeneous content, and septations. They may occasionally contain gas, a highly specific finding, seen as echogenic foci with reverberation artifacts.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr7-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup> The presence of gas in an intra-abdominal fluid collection is suggestive of infection, although it is observed in only a small percentage of patients.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> Differentiating hematomas from abscesses is challenging, particularly during the organization phase, which requires distinct diagnostic approaches.</p><p>Ultrasound elastography is a widely used method that has been increasingly adopted across various clinical fields. Elastography measures tissue stiffness through a dynamic examination in addition to conventional B-mode ultrasonography. Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography is a radiation force&#8211;based imaging technique combined with ultrasound for the quantitative measurement of tissue elasticity. Acoustic pulses are generated in real time by a B-mode ultrasound probe, leading to localized tissue displacement, and the resulting shear wave velocity (SWV) is displayed as an ARFI image. This technique has proven to be useful in differentiating tissue characteristics across various body parts.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="bibr13-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Although the differential diagnosis of intra-abdominal abscess and hematoma can usually be made based on clinical laboratory findings and imaging findings of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT and MRI may not always be available. The determination of contrast enhancement in the walls after the administration of an intravenous contrast agent in CT and MRI can support the diagnosis of abscess, although contrast administration may be contraindicated in patients with allergies or a history of renal impairment, limiting the diagnostic performance of cross-sectional imaging methods.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr14-03000605251378696" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</sup> However, ARFI elastography is a safer, noninvasive bedside method that involves no ionizing radiation and does not require contrast material administration.</p><p>As exudative fluids show higher elastography velocity values because of the more prominent proteinaceous and blood contents than transudative fluids in the pleural space,<sup>

Before drainage, the patients were evaluated in the supine position to identify the location and sonographic features of the fluid via B-mode ultrasonography. For each lesion, gain and focal depth adjustments were made for optimal visualization and measurements. Then, SWV measurements were performed using the ElastPQ option in ARFI elastography application via the same ultrasound probe. Before the elastography examination, all patients were instructed to hold their breath and remain still during the procedure. The probe was applied with gel and placed in slight contact with the skin, and the lesion site was identified via B-mode ultrasound.

</sup> As imaging modalities have lower specificity in differentiating intra-abdominal fluid collections, distinguishing between hematoma and abscess is challenging, as they require different treatment approaches. Although clinical and laboratory findings are important, they may not always be adequate for early diagnosis.

They stated that in contrast to abscess cavities, the surrounding indurated tissues were detected in almost all (98%) of the lesions. In addition, in all these lesions, the surrounding indurated tissue showed blue (firm) and dark blue (stiffest) signals.

They found the lowest stiffness values in simple cysts (1.4&#8201;kPa), abscesses (2.71&#8201;kPa), and hydatid cysts (2.8&#8201;kPa).</p><p>In the literature, only a few studies have investigated sonoelastography for cystic lesions, and data on hemorrhage and abscess are extremely limited. Previous studies have suggested that SWV values are higher in hemorrhagic lesions and lower in abscesses. Consistent with the literature, we found that the SWV values were significantly higher in hematomas than in abscesses. In addition, we found a cutoff value of 0.72&#8201;m/s with a sensitivity of 82.4% and specificity of 67% for differentiation. We did not include chronic hematomas in this study because of the increased risk of infection and the likelihood of aspiration failure due to their semi-solid clot contents. As increased stiffness of hematoma is associated with degraded blood products, high protein levels, and high iron concentrations, we believe that chronic hematomas would show higher SWV values than acute hematomas. Consistent with this hypothesis, another study conducted at our institute revealed that the mean SWV values were significantly higher in subacute deep venous thrombosis than in acute deep venous thrombosis.<sup>

</sup> A study focused on the differentiation of elastography values in chronic/subacute and acute hematomas would be very useful; if this theory is confirmed, measurement of elastography values can be potentially used to identify chronic hematomas in cases where diagnostic aspiration is usually unsuccessful. In addition, establishing a cutoff value could help differentiate acute from chronic hematomas and may aid in diagnosing ongoing bleeding through serial sonoelastographic measurements.</p><p>Because abscesses have thick, enhancing walls and show restricted diffusion, contrast agent administration and additional sequences are required to differentiate hematomas from abscesses on sectional radiological examinations. An advantage of this method is that it does not require contrast administration and does not expose patients to ionizing radiation. In addition, CT and MRI may not be available in certain centers and conditions. Moreover, it takes only 1&#8211;2&#8201;min to obtain quantitative results. Another advantage is that it is a very feasible method that can be performed at the bedside, even in patients who have undergone surgical interventions that restrict their movement. The main limitation of elastography for this differentiation is that not all ultrasound devices include the elastography modality, and operators must be well-trained in the technique as this is a dynamic method in which the patients are asked to hold their breath and remain still for a short time. Calculating the mean SWE values in such lesions provides rapid information through a safe and readily available method, allowing aspiration of the content in the same procedural session in cases of abscess.</p><p>The major limitation of this study was that a single observer performed the calculations, as elastosonography is an operator-dependent technique. Moreover, the sample size in the hematoma group was relatively small. Furthermore, as only acute hematomas were included, elastographic features were not analyzed according to hematoma age. Because of the technical failure of elastography in lesions with a depth of &gt;8&#8201;cm, we could not evaluate deeper lesions. Confounding factors, including localization of effusion, amount of effusion, depth of the effusion, age of the effusion, and sex and age of the patients, which may influence SWE values, were not examined in this study. These factors should be evaluated in further studies with larger sample sizes, particularly in hematoma patients. In addition, future studies should assess the response to antimicrobial treatment by comparing pre- and post-treatment SWV measurements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec8-03000605251378696"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Radiological differentiation between intra-abdominal abscesses and hematomas, which have different treatment options and complications, is essential and challenging in most cases, as gray-scale ultrasound, CT, and MRI have some disadvantages and limited diagnostic accuracy. The results of this study support our hypothesis, demonstrating that intra-abdominal abscesses have significantly lower SWV values than hematomas, thereby aiding differentiation between these entities.
