Integrating literatures on political violence and decentralization, this article argues that incumbents use violence to engineer non-contestation among opposition actors in local elections. Drawing on the strength of local networks, incumbents prioritize their own strongholds for such violence, leading candidates to withdraw and resulting in uncontested seats. I explore this argument with data on local elections from West Bengal, a state in India that has held local elections since the 1970s but where competition is spatially uneven, resulting in a significant number of uncontested seats. The theoretical expectations are tested with disaggregated data on competitiveness and uncontested seats for 3,000 local electoral units. The article finds that increased violence against the opposition in an electoral unit leads to seats going uncontested in that unit. I complement these findings with 60 qualitative interviews from political elites and non-elites, which indicate that violence is an important means through which incumbents engineer non-contestation. These findings have important implications for research on political violence and subnational authoritarianism, particularly in understanding the emergence and persistence of subnational authoritarianism in decentralized countries.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Elections</kwd><kwd>violence</kwd><kwd>subnational democracy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="award1-00223433251353645"><funding-source id="funding1-00223433251353645"><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-00223433251353645">ERC Starting Grant No. 852439</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-00223433251353645"><title>Introduction</title><p>Competitive elections are an essential feature of democracy, empowering citizens to hold leaders accountable and shape governance. However, uncontested electoral seats &#8211; especially in local elections &#8211; undermine these principles, creating a democratic deficit. This issue worsens when violence is used strategically to deter opposition candidates, securing uncontested victories for incumbents. Such tactics deny voters meaningful choice and weaken the integrity of local democratic institutions, often seen as foundations of participatory governance (<xref rid="bibr54-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Mahmood, 2024</xref>). Urgency to understand this issue is heightened by the rising incidence of electoral violence and uncontested seats in democracies across the Global South (<xref rid="bibr5-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Bartels et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Cruz, 2023</xref>).<sup>
<xref rid="fn1-00223433251353645" ref-type="fn">1</xref>
</sup> These trends are puzzling as opposition parties often contest elections despite significant constraints, using the opportunity to criticize incumbents even when they stand little chance of winning (<xref rid="bibr25-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Daxecker and Rauschenbach, 2023</xref>). Meanwhile, incumbents often permit opposition participation to showcase the appearance of free and fair elections, thus gaining legitimacy (<xref rid="bibr9-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Bertrand, 2021</xref>). Therefore, despite clear benefits to both the incumbent and the opposition, the prevalence of uncontested seats raises numerous questions with implications for the health and future of local democracy.</p><p>This article advances our understanding of where and how non-contestation in local elections occurs, offering a novel perspective that it can be actively and coercively engineered. I argue that non-contestation is not merely a reflection of opposition candidates&#8217; choices or limited political participation but also an outcome of provincial incumbents&#8217; electoral strategies, often involving extreme acts of violence such as killings, kidnappings, or threats, which force opposition candidates to withdraw (<italic toggle="yes">ACLED</italic>, <xref rid="bibr1-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Specifically, I contend that variations in incumbent strength shape the likelihood of non-contestation, with uncontested seats more likely in areas where incumbents have strong networks. Additionally, I highlight violence as an underappreciated driver of non-contestation, paradoxically occurring in areas already under incumbent control. While prior research on &#8216;silent elections&#8217; emphasizes incumbency advantage, where challengers avoid contests to conserve resources, this article extends the inquiry by examining the role of violence (<xref rid="bibr16-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Caramani, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Harbers, 2014</xref>). It seeks to answer why winning by a large margin is not sufficient for incumbents and how violence is used to engineer non-contestation, indicating that non-contestation can be purposefully engineered to establish hegemony rather than being an unfortunate outcome of the opposition&#8217;s lack of organization or resources.</p><p>This article tests this argument using the case of West Bengal, a state of over 100&#8201;million people in India. West Bengal provides a compelling case because it holds regular local elections often marred by illicit strategies, particularly violence. Moreover, competition in the state has remained spatially uneven, marked by a high prevalence of uncontested seats &#8211; a strategy consistently utilized by incumbents over the years (<xref rid="bibr63-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Nath, 2019</xref>). Using a mixed-method approach with a novel dataset, the article examines how provincial incumbents leverage their partisan apparatus to orchestrate violence and deter opposition candidates from contesting in local elections. The analysis incorporates original election results data from over 3000 local electoral units, revealing that areas dominated by incumbents are more likely to experience non-contestation. Additionally, it draws on new disaggregated and georeferenced event data on violence during the 2018 local elections, enabling an analysis of the spatial variation and targets of violence. The quantitative findings are further supported by 60 interviews with political actors and ordinary voters, which corroborate the results and provide nuanced insights into how violence functions as the means to achieve non-contestation.</p><p>This article makes two key contributions to our understanding of local politics and election violence. First, it reconceptualizes uncontested seats as a deliberately engineered outcome of the incumbent&#8217;s electoral strategy. Existing research suggests that incumbents&#8217; access to resources gives them a competitive advantage, leading challengers to withdraw from races they cannot win (<xref rid="bibr46-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Konisky and Ueda, 2011</xref>). Alternatively, non-contestation is sometimes framed as an issue of representation, such as in cases of minority candidate emergence (<xref rid="bibr85-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Tolley, 2019</xref>). These perspectives, however, neglect how incumbents can exploit their position to engineer non-contestation among opponents, further solidifying their power. This reconceptualization has significant theoretical implications, as it highlights that non-contestation does not equate to a total lack of competition. Instead, it points to a context where opposition candidates are willing to contest but are forcibly excluded. This purposeful exclusion of competitors undermines the democratic process of elections, forcing voters to accept predetermined outcomes and reducing the political uncertainty inherent in elections(<xref rid="bibr70-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Schedler, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Second, by integrating literatures on local politics and political violence to develop the argument, the article explains how engineered non-contestation is achieved violently. While political violence has long been used as a tool for electoral demobilization, recent years have seen an increase in violence targeting political actors, particularly at the local level (<xref rid="bibr49-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Kumar, 2020</xref>). For instance, India experienced a 44% increase in violence against local officials in 2023 compared to 2022, with significant spikes in violence during elections in states such as West Bengal, Manipur and Uttar Pradesh. These trends highlight a growing correlation between elections and targeted violence (<xref rid="bibr39-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Harish and Toha, 2019</xref>). Despite the acknowledged importance of local elections in shaping grassroots power dynamics, research on local politics often overlooks the role of violence, particularly in rural settings, with much of the existing work focusing on urban contexts (<xref rid="bibr93-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson, 2004</xref>). Using both qualitative and quantitative sources of data the article shows how violence is engineered to produce non-contestation and provides more nuance to understanding the increased levels of violence in local politics.</p><sec id="section2-00223433251353645"><title>What do we know about uncontested seats?</title><p>An uncontested seat can be defined as an electoral seat where only one candidate runs, leaving voters with no alternative option (<xref rid="bibr47-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Kouba and Lysek, 2023</xref>). Consequently, voters are unable to express their preferences through voting as the sole contender wins the election uncontested. Thus, elections with uncontested seats pose a greater concern compared to elections with uncompetitive seats. In uncontested elections, voters are deprived of any influence on the outcome, as the candidate automatically secures victory without any votes being cast. In contrast, uncompetitive elections, while lacking meaningful competition, still feature few challengers, theoretically allowing voters to make a choice (<xref rid="bibr46-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Konisky and Ueda, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr69-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Schedler, 2002</xref>). Even in rigged elections, citizens can signal disapproval by abstaining or spoiling ballots, options unavailable in uncontested elections (<xref rid="bibr29-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Frantz, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr67-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Power and Roberts, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Prevailing explanations for uncontested seats often suggest that opposition actors opt to withdraw from electoral races when faced with significantly stronger competitors (<xref rid="bibr17-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Carey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bibr50-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Lay et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr75-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Squire 2000</xref>). While, theoretically, any party or competitor could deter challengers from contesting, incumbents typically possess the greatest capacity to exert such influence. The occurrence of uncontested seats is frequently attributed to the financial and political resources enjoyed by incumbents. Research on uncontested seats within subnational state legislatures has shown that legislatures provide incumbents with ample means to solidify their positions and increase their electoral advantage (<xref rid="bibr46-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Konisky and Ueda, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Other explanations highlight disparities in political representation, particularly for marginalized groups. In contexts where incumbents often belong to dominant groups, minority challengers are less likely to emerge due to structural and systemic disadvantages (<xref rid="bibr85-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Tolley, 2019</xref>). In India, quotas for marginalized groups shape who can run for office. Marginalized groups, often constrained by economic and social barriers, are less likely to produce strong candidates. As a result, the pool of contenders for reserved seats is often limited, with most strong candidates aligning with incumbents, further reinforcing their advantage (<xref rid="bibr3-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Auerbach and Ziegfeld, 2020</xref>). While these explanations provide insight into non-contestation, they overlook a critical cause: non-contestation as a deliberate incumbent strategy, often enforced through violence.</p><p>A second strand of literature, moving away from incumbency advantage, emphasizes the influence of political parties as organizational entities on levels of contestation. This body of work traces the transition from an elite-dominated mode of politics to one where political parties dominate. For example, a restricted electoral franchise and dominant local notables partly explain the large number of uncontested seats in electoral contests in the UK (<xref rid="bibr28-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Foster, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="bibr72-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Sharman, 2003</xref>). Similarly, a study of British parliamentary elections found that incumbents with ties to the nobility were more likely to remain unchallenged (<xref rid="bibr19-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Coats and Dalton, 1992</xref>). Other cross-national studies argue that changes in levels of non-contestation are congruent with changes in party organization (<xref rid="bibr68-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Rallings et al., 2005</xref>). The emergence of modern parties focusing on &#8216;systemwide&#8217; campaigning rather than local community politics has been linked to rising levels of contestation (<xref rid="bibr16-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Caramani, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bibr72-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Sharman, 2003</xref>). However, this cannot explain the recent worrying rise in uncontested elections around the world.</p><p>Recent research highlights the instrumentalization of political parties for violence, where parties are mobilized to demobilize rivals through coercive strategies (<xref rid="bibr43-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Klaus and Turnbull, 2025</xref>; <xref rid="bibr56-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Malik, 2024</xref>; <xref rid="bibr74-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Siddiqui, 2022</xref>). This is particularly relevant in understanding the absence of contenders in local elections. Theories of political violence provide useful insights into the &#8216;exclusion of competitors&#8217; from the electoral field, with scholarship highlighting how opponents are demobilized through various illicit methods to tilt the playing field in favor of the incumbent (<xref rid="bibr14-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Birch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr38-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Harbers et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bibr69-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Schedler, 2002</xref>). Research on incumbent-sponsored election violence finds that a majority of the violence is directed at making opposition mobilization more difficult (<xref rid="bibr30-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi and Lust-Okar, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr76-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>). In such contexts,where the incumbent is seeking re-election most of the violence occurs in the pre-electoral period (<xref rid="bibr10-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Bhasin and Gandhi, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Hafner-Burton et al., 2018</xref>). While most of these studies focus on incumbent-sponsored violence at the national level, similar empirical findings have been made at the subnational level (<xref rid="bibr7-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Berenschot, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Harish and Toha, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr86-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Turnbull, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Incumbents at both the national and subnational level have been implicated in the targeting of challengers and their supporters, which constitutes a form of &#8216;electoral cleansing&#8217; (<xref rid="bibr15-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Bratton and Masunungure, 2008</xref>). This subcategory of elite-upon-elite violence has primarily focused on lethal events and assassinations (<xref rid="bibr66-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Perliger, 2017</xref>). The targeted assassinations of candidates appears to occur primarily in the pre-electoral phase to skew the electoral outcome by eliminating threats to political power (<xref rid="bibr65-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Onapajo, 2014</xref>). This lethal violence against opposition elites has certain spillover effects, where violence against the opposition signals to the electorate the inability to protect itself. Incumbent-sponsored violence diminishes confidence in the opposition as a viable alternative by making them appear weak (<xref rid="bibr26-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Edwards and Pierson, 2022</xref>).</p><p>While the research on incumbent-sponsored violence is abundant, it is still unclear whether and how political violence and uncontested seats are geographically related and why that is the case. Studies on election violence at the subnational level indicate that violence is more likely in uncompetitive units rather than competitive ones, as it is used to signal political dominance (<xref rid="bibr84-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Toha, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr92-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Wahman and Goldring, 2020</xref>). However, it is uncertain who controls these uncompetitive units &#8211; the opposition or the incumbent. Some studies find evidence of violence in incumbent strongholds, while others find evidence in favor of opposition strongholds (<xref rid="bibr2-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Albarrac&#237;n et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bibr18-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Choi and Raleigh, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr25-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Daxecker and Rauschenbach, 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr91-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Wahman, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Existing explanations of electoral violence often focus on how opponents are weakened during elections, overlooking how they can be entirely incapacitated from contesting. Some findings emerge from studies on subnational undemocratic regimes, which reveal that such regimes that attempt to demobilize the opposition often lack commitment to principles of good governance and political accountability (<xref rid="bibr33-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Gibson, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Giraudy, 2015</xref>).

The focus is solely on incumbent calculations and not on the opposition&#8217;s response. Specifically, this theory explains why winning by a large margin is not sufficient for the incumbent and how violence drives non-contestation. Provincial incumbents use violence to engineer non-contestation during local elections, consolidating their control, with the violence paradoxically being most prevalent in their strongholds. These strategies create arenas of illiberal politics, where the incumbent party asserts dominance over local affairs while impeding opposition mobilization efforts. By doing so, incumbents strengthen stronghold boundaries, reducing the likelihood of opposition advances supported by national partisan allies (<xref rid="bibr33-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Gibson, 2005</xref>). The degree of central government intervention in subnational politics can vary across countries, necessitating provincial incumbents to devise strategies to neutralize such threats. In India, for instance, the imposition of President&#8217;s Rule allows the central government to assume control over a province, posing a vertical threat to provincial autonomy (<xref rid="bibr37-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Harbers et al., 2019</xref>).<sup>

</sup> Within this context, violence by provincial incumbents can also be interpreted as a defensive strategy to weaken rivals within, and consolidating their power to resist central interference.</p><p>In this article, the provincial incumbent refers to a political party in power at a subnational level, operating below the national level. With decentralization reforms, many countries now have provincial incumbents wielding significant fiscal, administrative and political authority over their provinces. These second-tier provincial incumbents may resort to various undemocratic actions to prolong their regime continuity, including preventing the opposition from attaining any elected office (<xref rid="bibr34-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Giraudy, 2015</xref>). In India, provincial incumbents have frequently been linked to violence, particularly when it yields electoral advantage (<xref rid="bibr23-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Daxecker et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="bibr93-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson, 2004</xref>). Subnational democracy in India varies, with many provincial parties asserting hegemonic control by employing violence and limiting voters&#8217; ability to choose viable opposition alternatives (<xref rid="bibr37-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Harbers et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Local elections present viable opportunities to strengthen or weaken degrees of political control through effective campaign strategies. Although distinct from rebel groups, provincial incumbent parties similarly use violence to assert territorial dominance for both symbolic and strategic purposes (<xref rid="bibr42-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Kalyvas, 2006</xref>). It is essential to note that political power in rural or peripheral areas of developing democracies is often intertwined with illicit sources of income. A loss in local elections to the opposition not only represents a formal electoral defeat but also threatens access to these revenue sources and the patronage networks that sustain political dominance (<xref rid="bibr2-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Albarrac&#237;n et al., 2022</xref>). These revenue streams play a pivotal role in rewarding loyal supporters, financing election campaigns and sustaining violence capabilities. Provincial incumbents frequently rely on violent extortive methods to retain control over illicit resources as they compete with partisan rivals (<xref rid="bibr58-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Michelutti, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr88-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Vaishnav, 2017</xref>). Local elections, therefore, become a battleground where opposition parties can establish grassroots political control, posing a direct threat to the incumbent&#8217;s dominance. It poses a twofold threat: it undermines the ruling party&#8217;s control over local resources, and disrupts its future electoral prospects. The heightened stakes and being the one with the most to lose explain why non-contestation is engineered using violence to reduce electoral uncertainty.</p><p>The violent engineering of non-contestation fulfills the dual objectives of weakening the opposition and establishing a hegemonic presence. Mere manipulation through vote-buying or other clientelist strategies is often insufficient, especially during local elections that, while skewed in the incumbent&#8217;s favor, pose a real threat to the existing status quo. Using violence to win elections and dominate the political landscape is crucial for provincial incumbents who must navigate both local and national politics. National elites have significant resources to support the electoral campaigns of their provincial affiliates or can deploy state forces to suppress provincial rivals. Building a strong local foundation gives provincial elites greater leverage and helps keep the central government out of local politics (<xref rid="bibr33-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Gibson, 2005</xref>). While constitutional safeguards limit the provincial incumbent&#8217;s ability to directly violate democratic institutions extensively, it can utilize its partisan apparatus to circumvent formal rules. The costs of outright banning opposition activity are high, leading the provincial incumbent to potentially use non-state actors, like party workers, to carry out violence on its behalf (<xref rid="bibr52-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Levitsky and Way, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr86-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Turnbull, 2020</xref>).<sup>

</sup></p><p>Through violence, the incumbent aims to dismantle the local infrastructure of rival parties, refusing to tolerate any form of rival party mobilization. Therefore, this article theorizes the logic behind targeting the opposition. The persistent use of violence against any rival presence makes it exceedingly difficult to sustain opposition efforts. Violence is often preferred over nonviolent strategies as it provides a swift and decisive way to disrupt opposition activities, achieving results faster than legal or administrative barriers. Buying off competitors is resource-intensive, and involves risks as opposition actors can reject offers. In contexts with weak judicial or bureaucratic oversight, violence becomes a more accessible tool for incumbents. Opposition leaders and party workers, being a smaller group compared to ordinary voters, are easier to identify and target with violence. Additionally, opposition actors are more visible during electoral campaigns. Targeting them with violence acts as a form of &#8216;electoral cleansing&#8217;, which eliminates electoral threats and cripples opposition collective action (<xref rid="bibr15-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Bratton and Masunungure, 2008</xref>).</p><p>By limiting the targets of violence, the incumbent maintains its credibility. The use of violence against opponents may not elicit a backlash from the electorate if they are not directly affected. Violence against the opposition in the pre-electoral period is less likely to make voters doubt the fairness of elections, as they do not experience the full effects of violence (<xref rid="bibr10-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Bhasin and Gandhi, 2013</xref>).<sup>
<xref rid="fn4-00223433251353645" ref-type="fn">4</xref>
</sup> Thus, this article hypothesizes that opposition leaders and workers will be the primary targets of violence, focusing on the subcategory of elite-upon-elite violence (<xref rid="bibr45-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Kongkirati, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr69-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Schedler, 2002</xref>).</p><list list-type="simple" id="list1-00223433251353645"><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Hypothesis 1</italic>: Increased electoral violence against the opposition in an electoral unit leads to a higher number of uncontested seats in that unit.</p></list-item></list><p>However, resource constraints may prevent this strategy from being implemented everywhere. Local political geography will dictate how election violence will play out (<xref rid="bibr61-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">M&#252;ller-Crepon, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bibr91-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Wahman, 2023</xref>). The use of violence in areas already controlled by the incumbent party may seem counterintuitive, but it is deemed necessary for &#8216;boundary control&#8217; and safeguarding the territories they control (<xref rid="bibr6-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Behrend, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Gibson, 2005</xref>). This article anticipates that violence for establishing a hegemonic presence will predominantly occur within incumbent strongholds, a pattern also documented in many contexts like Colombia (<xref rid="bibr87-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Uribe, 2025</xref>). In strongholds, the incumbent can closely monitor violence, enforce compliance and effectively punish non-compliance. As incumbents, they leverage dense partisan networks and local dominance, often reinforced by control over police and judicial entities, enabling them to orchestrate violence with minimal repercussions (<xref rid="bibr8-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Berenschot, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Daxecker et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, rival parties in such strongholds are typically poorly organized. The incumbent can effectively use violence to coerce opposition candidates into withdrawing their candidatures. In these areas, where the opposition lacks significant support and security resources, they are unable to counter threats or mobilize voters who fear openly opposing the incumbent. Additionally, violence in strongholds faces less resistance from voters, as a majority who support the incumbent perceive violence by co-partisans as minor infractions (<xref rid="bibr24-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Daxecker and Fjelde, 2022</xref>). More importantly, violence in this context goes beyond securing an election win. Ultimately, such violence deepens partisan control and entrenches political dominance, consolidating the incumbent&#8217;s hold on power (<xref rid="bibr51-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">LeBas, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr64-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Nath and Ray, 2022</xref>). With no opposition, fewer resources are needed for strategies like vote-buying, freeing finances to target competitive areas. Thus, a second hypothesis is</p><list list-type="simple" id="list2-00223433251353645"><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Hypothesis 2</italic>: Violence against the opposition increases uncontested seats more in electoral units where the incumbent is stronger than in units it is not.</p></list-item></list><p>The argument outlined above has certain scope conditions. The theory and the empirics of this article are limited to the incumbent&#8217;s capacity and incentives for bringing about non-contestation. What is more, the article looks at the strategies used by a provincial-level incumbent, having a distinct political aim, in a decentralized electoral system. The political aim is the desire to consolidate control within its province. While opposition actors may have incentives for violence, incumbents face higher stakes, as losing local control threatens their broader political future in subnational elections. Therefore, the article excludes opposition calculations from the argument.</p><p>The theory developed in this study, based on India, has important implications for generalizability. This article develops a general theory of interaction between the provincial incumbent and local politics. It is not confined to understanding violence in contexts with a three-tiered system of government, like India. At its core, the theory is a two-level theory, as insights from this article can also be used to understand violent dynamics in two-tiered systems of governance where the subnational incumbent attempts to consolidate control using violence. It is particularly applicable to contexts where decentralization has endowed subnational units with substantial fiscal and political autonomy.</p><p>The implications of this framework extend to contexts where decentralization fosters entrenched systems of clientelism and patronage, as political power provides access to economic opportunities and legal immunity. Losing power in such systems risks not only financial losses but also exposure to legal repercussions (<xref rid="bibr13-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Birch, 2021</xref>). These dynamics are particularly pronounced in countries like Zimbabwe and Indonesia, where violence against candidates &#8211; especially during the nomination process &#8211; has been a recurring phenomenon (<xref rid="bibr71-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Seeberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr84-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Toha, 2017</xref>).<sup>

</sup> While local offices served as crucial channels for implementing rural welfare schemes, the primary motive behind decentralization was to maintain the party&#8217;s control over the rural electorate.

Growing voter dissatisfaction with these coercive practices facilitated the rise of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC).</p><p>Like its predecessors, the AITC used local councils to implement welfare schemes alongside coercive tactics. Distributing direct cash benefits, food grains and other perks, the AITC secured rural support and a historic mandate in the 2016 elections. However, these strategies were marred by violence, corruption and extortion.

Uncontested seats have been a recurring feature in rural elections. For instance, 11% of seats were uncontested in 2003, falling to 5% in 2008, but rising again to 10.6% in 2013; and then 34% in 2018 by the AITC (<xref rid="bibr12-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharyya and Rana, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr83-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Times of India, 2018e</xref>).

Although extreme violence may be less frequently reported elsewhere, local elections across India are not immune to fraud. Local elections, administered by more vulnerable State Election Commissions, are prone to provincial incumbent interference, including postponements or cancellations (<xref rid="bibr49-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Kumar, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr59-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Picherit, 2020</xref>). Historically, local elections in states like Uttar Pradesh have also been marked by violence. Alongside overt violence, a significant number of uncontested seats have been a recurring feature in other states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Violence often underpins these outcomes, as seen in Punjab, where Congress workers avoided campaigning due to threats from the incumbent (<xref rid="bibr57-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr78-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Thomas, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Given these undemocratic trends in local politics in India, West Bengal serves as a suitable case for testing the theory for three reasons. First, West Bengal has a highly decentralized electoral system. Rural local elections have been a regular feature of political life ever since their introduction in 1978 by the Left Front government. The allocation of a substantial amount of funds and administrative power to implement developmental schemes has resulted in local rural electoral units becoming extremely vital and competitive (<xref rid="bibr48-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Kumar and Ghosh, 1996</xref>). Control over such institutions allows effective party institutionalization at the local level but also the opportunity to consolidate existing patronage networks with access to state and national resources. Local elections involve elections to either municipalities in urban areas or village councils in rural areas.<sup>
<xref rid="fn11-00223433251353645" ref-type="fn">11</xref>
</sup></p><p>Secondly, even though West Bengal has held local elections since the 1970s, competition remains spatially uneven, resulting in a significant number of uncontested seats. Non-contestation has been a persistent feature of local politics in West Bengal, raising concerns about its role in reinforcing the incumbent&#8217;s hegemony and sparking debates over its impact on democratic governance (<xref rid="bibr4-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Banerjee, 2011</xref>). The high number of uncontested victories in 2018 drew attention, particularly due to accompanying allegations of electoral manipulation by the incumbent.</p><p>Finally, local politics in West Bengal appears to be dominated primarily by the incumbent. The incumbent has been implicated in the use of coercive strategies with the aim of skewing the electoral playing field. There have been reports of the incumbent routinely targeting and harassing its opponents (<xref rid="bibr24-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Daxecker and Fjelde, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bibr63-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Nath, 2019</xref>). While the incumbent is motivated to use extralegal measures to secure a victory, the elections in the state are free and fair to some degree. The democratic institutions in place cannot wholly be usurped by the provincial incumbent to guarantee a victory. The intervention of the judiciary and the involvement of security forces from outside the state safeguard the rights of opponents to some extent.

I also relied on national and English language newspapers. These were accessed via Nexis Uni, where reports were identified using key terms such as &#8216;clash&#8217;, &#8216;riot&#8217;, &#8216;violence&#8217; and so forth.

Selective coverage and editorial constraints may overrepresent newsworthy incidents, underestimating less overt forms of violence. Additionally, incumbent pressures often prevent the partisan identities of actors from being reported, even when events are documented, obscuring patterns of incumbent-sponsored violence.

The proportion of <italic toggle="yes">Seats reserved for minorities</italic> is controlled for, as research has shown that affirmative action can influence competition and electoral outcomes (<xref rid="bibr21-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2023</xref>).

Economic development may indeed influence the likelihood of violence occurrence, as areas with higher income levels may attract more attention from political actors seeking to control resources (<xref rid="bibr41-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Wantchekon, 2004</xref>). Similarly, densely populated areas may present more opportunities for violence due to the presence of more potential targets and better infrastructure for mobilization.</p><p>Thirdly, a measure of <italic toggle="yes">Uncontested seats from 2013</italic> is created. This variable is included because areas with a prior history of non-contestation may be more sensitive to electoral malpractices in future elections.

However, the interaction between electoral violence and incumbent strength is significant only at 10&#8201;km. These results do not show consistent and robust findings for Hypothesis 2. These mixed findings for Hypothesis 2 may stem from the distribution and variability of violent incidents at different distances. Substantively, this suggests that opposition candidates in incumbent strongholds likely anticipate deterrence and are risk-averse due to low winning chances. However, widespread violence within a 10&#8201;km radius amplifies fear, making it harder for opposition candidates to dismiss the threat. Interestingly, the results show that districts where the incumbent party performed strongly in the 2016 provincial elections, featured fewer uncontested seats in the 2018 election.<sup>

Its purpose was to contextualize and verify conclusions drawn from quantitative analyses. During the fieldwork, I conducted 60 interviews in cities, towns and 30 local councils. By selecting the most typical cases I was able to detect how violence unfolds. Typical cases serve an exploratory role, and in this case, they helped assess the plausibility of my argument. My goal was to understand the mechanisms of incumbent-sponsored violence. However, researchers often combine multiple case-selection strategies.

</p><p>These vignettes depict how the incumbent uses violence prior to the election to demobilize opponents and ensure that seats remain uncontested. The incumbent is keen to ensure that these violent strategies are kept under wraps to avoid sparking outrage. This point is illustrated by the attack on journalists. The incumbent in such areas has enough capacity to launch a full-scale attack upon challengers and civilians like journalists. Opposition actors often find themselves unable to counter the violence effectively or seek redress, as their complaints go unacknowledged. Additionally, opposition members are frequently falsely accused of being aggressors, leading to their arrest, which forces them to withdraw from the electoral race.<sup><xref rid="fn29-00223433251353645" ref-type="fn">29</xref>,<xref rid="fn30-00223433251353645" ref-type="fn">30</xref></sup> Pre-election violence in areas under incumbent control demonstrates the party&#8217;s extensive manpower. For instance, in Bankura district, a senior BJP leader alleged that nearly 300 AITC-affiliated &#8216;goons&#8217; attacked him while he attempted to file a complaint about being unable to submit nomination papers. The ability to mobilize such large numbers of party workers &#8211; capable of going door-to-door in neighboring villages to suppress opposition mobilization &#8211; is indicative of the incumbent&#8217;s dominance. Even when restrictions on assembly are imposed, incumbent-affiliated actors can operate with relative impunity.</p><p>These findings support the central claim of this article that uncontested seats are a coercive form of building partisan control.

By doing so, the article presents a theory and evidence demonstrating that non-contestation can be strategically engineered by incumbents as part of their electoral strategy, rather than merely resulting from the opposition&#8217;s lack of resources or weak organization. Using the case of West Bengal, the study finds that incumbents are more likely to use violence to engineer non-contestation in areas where the incumbent is strong and has robust networks, highlighting how power is consolidated.</p><p>While the study draws on evidence from West Bengal, India, it has broader implications. Violence in local politics has been on the rise, with India overall experiencing two-thirds of violent events against local officials in 2023 in the Asia Pacific region. Such trends when coinciding with elections and emerging from countries that are not considered to be actively violent are troubling for local democracy (<italic toggle="yes">ACLED</italic>, <xref rid="bibr1-00223433251353645" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).<sup>
<xref rid="fn31-00223433251353645" ref-type="fn">31</xref>
</sup> Therefore the theory and findings of this article also have important implications for research on the emergence of subnational authoritarian regimes where incumbents routinely use violence to suppress any meaningful opposition. Future research could explore the effect of multiple election cycles and whether violence and non-contestation are useful or even required in entrenching the incumbent. Additionally, exploring other local factors, such as institutional strength, elite coalitions or the availability of violence actors, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of violence&#8217;s role in undermining democratic processes. Finally, future studies should consider how violence interacts with other undemocratic practices, such as turnout buying or opposition co-optation.</p><p>This article provides valuable insights for policymakers and election observers to identify regions vulnerable to non-contestation driven by electoral violence. By highlighting the relationship between incumbent strength and violence, it emphasizes the need for targeted measures to protect opposition candidates and voters, ensuring fairer elections. Such strategies are crucial in mitigating violence that undermines both democratic participation and the proper functioning of local governance. Reducing violence in elections not only promotes competitive elections but also ensures that ordinary citizens can benefit from accountable and effective local government.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>I gratefully thank Ursula Daxecker for providing access to the data used in this paper and for her valuable feedback, as well as EvAP project members Maureen Fubara and Neeraj Prasad for their comments.
