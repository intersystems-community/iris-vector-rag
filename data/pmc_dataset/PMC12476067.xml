The burden is significantly higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 80&#160;% of CVD-related deaths occur, with South Asia bearing the highest risk and CHD being the region's leading cause of death (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Roth et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0075">Pakistan, a LMIC with a population exceeding 240 million, has an alarming CHD prevalence of 26.9&#160;%, affecting one in four middle-aged adults (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Jafar et al., 2005</xref>). In year 2020 alone, CHD caused 240,720 deaths in Pakistan, with its rising burden increasing the risk of morbidity and placing immense strain on country's under-resourced healthcare system (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Qureshi et al., 2025</xref>; <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Hafeez et al., 2023</xref>). Several factors contribute to this burden, including the high prevalence of hypertension (37&#160;%), diabetes (30.8&#160;%), and obesity (23&#160;%), along with unhealthy behaviors such as poor dietary choices, physical inactivity and smoking (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Samad and Hanif, 2023</xref>). These modifiable risk factors not only increase health risks but also impose significant economic burden due to frequent hospitalizations, invasive treatments, and associated healthcare costs.

A patient-centered approach is crucial in this context, as it empowers individuals to manage their condition while addressing personal, behavioral, psychosocial and cultural factors that influence self-management (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Marques et al., 2021</xref>).

Additionally, nurses as trusted caregivers, also address psychosocial and cultural barriers through empathetic communication and culturally sensitive care, promoting sustained self-management (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Araki, 2019</xref>). While evidence from high-income countries supports effectiveness of nurse-led patient-centered care interventions, emerging studies from South Asia and other LMICs indicate variable effectiveness, highlighting the influence of local cultural, social, and healthcare contexts, yet systematic evidence remains limited. Tailored interventions that integrate individual preferences, address behavioral and social factors, and consider cultural and social factors such as family roles, health literacy, and gender norms can effectively bridge this gap.

Qualitative insights confirmed its feasibility and identified areas for improvement, including delivery format, family involvement and ongoing support for long-term impact. These findings align with existing evidence supporting patient-centered self-care interventions in chronic disease management (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Chiang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Creswell and Poth, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="p0245">The quantitative results indicated a significant improvement in SE and SCB following PCSI. These findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating the impact of structured self-care interventions on improving health outcomes in patients with CHD (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Song, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Asmat et al., 2022</xref>). SE is a crucial determinant of sustained behavioral change, and its enhancement through PCSI suggests long-term benefits for effective disease management. Given that enhanced SE and SCB are associated with reduced hospital readmissions and better clinical outcomes (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Shin and Khim, 2002</xref>), these findings highlight the potential of PCSI as an effective strategy for improving CHD management in resource-limited settings. However, the very high post-test scores also suggest a potential ceiling effect, which may have limited the measurable range of improvement and should be considered when interpreting the magnitude of the improvements. Future studies could address this by including longer follow-up periods, larger sample sizes, or more sensitive measurement tools to better capture sustained changes and avoid ceiling effects.</p><p id="p0250">The qualitative findings confirmed the feasibility of PCSI in a low-resource setting, with participants valuing its relevance, clarity, and personalized bedside delivery. The timing of the intervention was perceived as particularly beneficial, as it allowed participants to transition smoothly to self-care at home. Similar studies have emphasized the importance of tailored discharge interventions in improving patient&#8217; adherence to self-care at home (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Riegel et al., 2021</xref>). With regards, to areas of improvement, participants suggested restructuring the intervention into shorter sessions to improve retention, which aligns with research indicating that breaking down educational and behavioral training sessions enhances engagement and comprehension (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Posadas-Collado et al., 2022</xref>). Others highlighted cultural barriers to dietary changes, noting the challenge of maintaining diet control within a family setting. This highlights the need to involve family members in self-care education, a strategy that has shown to improve adherence in similar interventions. Additionally, participants emphasized the importance of ongoing post-discharge support, reinforcing evidence that continued follow-up interventions contribute to sustained behavioral change (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Riegel et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Nemec and McKown, 2024</xref>).</p><p id="p0255">In Pakistan, a country facing rising burden of CHD, with constrained healthcare resources and in-adequate patient education, PCSI presents a viable approach to enhancing SE and SCB, thus effective disease management. The PCSI's effectiveness and feasibility suggest that it can be scaled up to benefit a broader population, provided that certain modifications, such as involving family members, adapting session structures, and integrating follow-up support, are incorporated. Furthermore, integrating PCSI into existing healthcare systems, such as nurse-led discharge planning and community-based follow-up programs, could enhance sustainability and ensure that benefits are maintained over time. Embedding the intervention within routine care pathways and training nurses to deliver PCSI may support scalability in resource-constrained settings.</p><p id="p0260">This study's strengths include its mixed-methods approach, which provided a comprehensive understanding of PCSI's impact by integrating quantitative outcomes with qualitative insights. However, limitations include the study's reliance on self-reported data, which may introduce response bias, and its focus on a specific population from a single hospital, potentially limiting generalizability. Additionally, the short follow-up period of four weeks may not capture the sustainability of observed changes, and the absence of a control group may limit the ability to draw causal inferences.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0265">This study supports the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of PCSI in improving SE and SCB among adults with CHD in a resource-constrained setting. While beneficial, its impact could be enhanced through shorter sessions, greater family involvement, and ongoing support. Clinically, the findings suggest that nurse-led, patient-centered interventions can be integrated into routine care to strengthen self-management and improve CHD outcomes. At a policy level, scaling up PCSI within healthcare systems in LMICs may optimize resources and ease the burden on overstretched services. Future research should assess its long-term sustainability, comparative effectiveness, and potential for broader implementation across diverse settings.</p></sec><sec id="s0100"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0275"><bold>Rukhsana Perveen:</bold> Writing &#8211; original draft, Resources, Project administration, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization. <bold>Muhammad Saqib Rabbani:</bold> Writing &#8211; review &amp; editing, Supervision, Methodology, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization. <bold>Samina Kausar:</bold> Writing &#8211; review &amp; editing, Validation, Supervision, Resources, Methodology, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization. <bold>Kainat Asmat:</bold> Writing &#8211; review &amp; editing, Supervision, Methodology, Formal analysis, Conceptualization.</p></sec><sec id="s0095"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0270">This study did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
