Document 1 discusses the influence of insulin and incretin-based therapies on renal tubular transport, Document 2 discusses urinary Transforming Growth Factor-beta 1 as a marker of response to immunosuppressive treatment in crescentic nephritis, and Document 3 discusses the interplay between complement, inflammation, and bioincompatibility in hemodialysis.\n\nTo fully answer the question on how SGLT2 inhibition affects kidney function, additional information specifically related to SGLT2 inhibitors and their impact on renal function would be needed. SGLT2 inhibitors are a class of medication commonly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that work by blocking the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine. This mechanism of action has been shown to have beneficial effects on kidney function, particularly in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease.\n\nOverall, while the context provides information on various aspects of kidney function and treatment, it does not directly address the impact of SGLT2 inhibition on kidney function.",
