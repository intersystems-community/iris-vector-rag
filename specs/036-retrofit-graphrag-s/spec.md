## Context: GraphRAG Testing Improvements (Feature 034)

Feature 034 introduced comprehensive testing patterns for GraphRAG pipeline validation:

### Testing Patterns to Apply
1. **Contract Tests**: API behavior validation for core pipeline methods
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and clear error messages
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Automatic recovery when primary methods fail
4. **Diagnostic Logging**: Contextual error messages with actionable guidance
5. **Dimension Validation**: Vector embedding dimension compatibility checks
6. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end query path validation

### Target Pipelines for Retrofit
1. **BasicRAG** (`iris_rag/pipelines/basic.py`)
2. **CRAG** (`iris_rag/pipelines/crag.py`)
3. **BasicRerankRAG** (`iris_rag/pipelines/basic_rerank.py`)
4. **PyLateColBERT** (`iris_rag/pipelines/pylate_colbert.py`)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A developer running tests on any RAG pipeline (BasicRAG, CRAG, BasicRerankRAG, or PyLateColBERT) receives clear, actionable error messages when configuration issues occur, experiences graceful fallbacks when primary methods fail, and can validate their setup through comprehensive contract and integration tests.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a BasicRAG pipeline with missing embeddings configuration, **When** the pipeline initializes, **Then** the system provides a clear diagnostic message identifying the missing configuration and suggesting how to fix it

2. **Given** a CRAG pipeline encountering a vector search failure, **When** the search executes, **Then** the system automatically falls back to text search and logs the fallback reason

3. **Given** a BasicRerankRAG pipeline with mismatched vector dimensions (model outputs 768, database expects 1536), **When** the pipeline performs embedding, **Then** the system detects the dimension mismatch and provides clear guidance on resolution

4. **Given** a PyLateColBERT pipeline during contract testing, **When** test_query_method executes, **Then** the test validates query input handling, response structure, and error conditions

5. **Given** any pipeline with a temporary database connection failure, **When** a query is attempted, **Then** the system retries with exponential backoff and provides diagnostic logging of retry attempts

6. **Given** a developer running integration tests on CRAG, **When** end-to-end query path executes, **Then** the test validates document retrieval, relevance evaluation, and generation steps with proper assertions

7. **Given** a BasicRAG pipeline with invalid LLM configuration (missing API key), **When** generation is attempted, **Then** the system provides a diagnostic error message indicating the missing credential and environment variable to set

8. **Given** a PyLateColBERT pipeline in a CI/CD environment, **When** contract tests run, **Then** all tests execute within 30 seconds and provide clear pass/fail status with actionable failure messages

### Edge Cases

#### Configuration Issues
- What happens when embedding model dimensions don't match database schema? ‚Üí System detects mismatch, logs clear error with both dimensions, suggests reconfiguration or migration
- What happens when API keys are missing for LLM providers? ‚Üí System provides diagnostic error with specific environment variable names to set
- What happens when vector store connection parameters are invalid? ‚Üí System validates connection on initialization, fails fast with connection string guidance

#### Runtime Failures
- How does the system handle transient database connection failures? ‚Üí Implements exponential backoff retry with configurable max attempts, logs each retry
- What happens when document retrieval returns zero results? ‚Üí System handles gracefully, logs diagnostic message, returns empty context with metadata
- How does the system respond when LLM generation times out? ‚Üí Implements timeout with fallback to cached/default response or clear timeout error

#### Validation Failures
- What happens when contract tests detect API contract violations? ‚Üí Test fails with clear diff between expected and actual behavior, blocks deployment
- How does the system handle dimension mismatches in multi-vector scenarios? ‚Üí Validates all vector dimensions before operations, fails early with comprehensive dimension report
- What happens when fallback mechanisms themselves fail? ‚Üí Logs cascade of fallback attempts, provides diagnostic chain, returns graceful error response

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Contract Test Coverage (FR-001 to FR-008)
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide contract tests validating core pipeline methods (query, load_documents, embed) for BasicRAG, CRAG, BasicRerankRAG, and PyLateColBERT
- **FR-002**: Contract tests MUST validate input parameter handling (required vs optional, type validation, boundary conditions)
- **FR-003**: Contract tests MUST validate response structure (required fields, data types, metadata presence)
- **FR-004**: Contract tests MUST validate error conditions (invalid inputs, missing configuration, connection failures)
- **FR-005**: System MUST execute all contract tests within 30 seconds for CI/CD compatibility
- **FR-006**: Contract tests MUST provide clear failure messages with expected vs actual behavior diffs
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate pipeline initialization requirements (embeddings, LLM configuration, vector store connection)
- **FR-008**: Contract tests MUST validate async method behavior (timeout handling, cancellation, concurrent execution)

#### Error Handling (FR-009 to FR-014)
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide diagnostic error messages for all configuration issues (missing API keys, invalid connection strings, dimension mismatches)
- **FR-010**: Error messages MUST include actionable guidance (specific environment variables to set, configuration parameters to adjust)
- **FR-011**: System MUST fail fast on initialization when critical configuration is missing (API keys, database connection, embedding model)
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle transient failures gracefully (database reconnection, API rate limits, network timeouts)
- **FR-013**: Error messages MUST include contextual information (pipeline type, operation attempted, current configuration state)
- **FR-014**: System MUST log error chains when multiple failures occur (primary method ‚Üí fallback ‚Üí final error)

#### Fallback Mechanisms (FR-015 to FR-020)
- **FR-015**: CRAG pipeline MUST fall back from vector search to text search when vector operations fail
- **FR-016**: BasicRAG pipeline MUST fall back to cached embeddings when embedding service is unavailable
- **FR-017**: System MUST log all fallback activations with triggering condition and fallback method used
- **FR-018**: Fallback mechanisms MUST preserve query semantics (return equivalent results when possible)
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide configuration to disable specific fallbacks for strict validation scenarios
- **FR-020**: Fallback chains MUST terminate gracefully when all fallback options exhausted

#### Dimension Validation (FR-021 to FR-024)
- **FR-021**: System MUST validate embedding dimension compatibility between model output and database schema on pipeline initialization
- **FR-022**: System MUST detect dimension mismatches before performing vector operations (search, storage, comparison)
- **FR-023**: Dimension validation errors MUST report both expected (database) and actual (model) dimensions with clear guidance
- **FR-024**: System MUST support dimension transformation when configured (dimension reduction, padding strategies)

#### Integration Testing (FR-025 to FR-028)
- **FR-025**: System MUST provide end-to-end integration tests for each pipeline validating full query path (retrieval ‚Üí ranking ‚Üí generation)
- **FR-026**: Integration tests MUST validate document loading, chunking, embedding, storage, and retrieval workflows
- **FR-027**: Integration tests MUST assert on response quality metrics (relevance, completeness, source attribution)
