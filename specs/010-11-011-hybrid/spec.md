**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: " 11. 011-hybrid-graphrag-architecture
    - Scope: Advanced multi-modal retrieval combining vector, text, and graph

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Enterprise RAG application users and developers need ultra-high-performance multi-modal retrieval capabilities that combine vector similarity, text search, and knowledge graph traversal in a single unified system. The system must deliver dramatic performance improvements through advanced fusion algorithms and optimized database integrations while maintaining security and providing graceful fallbacks when advanced components are unavailable.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a complex query requiring multiple search modalities, **When** the hybrid system processes the request, **Then** the system combines vector embeddings, text matching, and graph relationships using Reciprocal Rank Fusion to deliver superior result quality in under 100 milliseconds
2. **Given** IRIS Graph Core integration is available, **When** users execute queries, **Then** the system leverages HNSW-optimized vector search and native text search capabilities to achieve 50x performance improvements over standard approaches
3. **Given** advanced components are unavailable or fail, **When** the system encounters errors, **Then** the system gracefully degrades to standard GraphRAG functionality with clear status reporting and no silent failures
4. **Given** enterprise security requirements, **When** the system initializes, **Then** the system uses config-driven discovery and validated connection parameters without exposing credentials or using unsafe path modifications

### Edge Cases
- What happens when IRIS Graph Core modules are partially available but not fully functional? ‚Üí System fails initialization and requires manual configuration adjustment to ensure consistent operational state
- How does the system handle performance degradation when fusion algorithms encounter large result sets? ‚Üí System applies configurable result set size limits (default 50) to trigger performance optimization and maintain response time targets
- What occurs when different search modalities return conflicting relevance rankings for the same query? ‚Üí System applies Reciprocal Rank Fusion with equal modality weights by default, but supports configurable weights for domain-specific optimization
- How does the system manage memory and connection resources during high-concurrency multi-modal searches? ‚Üí System implements memory-bounded search result caching with LRU eviction, reusing existing LLM response caching infrastructure for consistent resource management

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support multiple retrieval methods including hybrid fusion, RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion), enhanced text search, and HNSW-optimized vector search with configurable selection
- **FR-002**: System MUST achieve performance targets of sub-100 millisecond response times for optimized searches with configurable result set size limits (default 50) and demonstrate measurable 50x performance improvements when advanced integrations are available
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement secure config-driven discovery of IRIS Graph Core components using the same IRIS database context as all other pipelines without additional credential management
- **FR-004**: System MUST fail initialization and require manual configuration adjustment when IRIS Graph Core modules are partially available to prevent inconsistent operational states, while providing graceful degradation for complete component unavailability
- **FR-005**: System MUST combine multiple search signals through Reciprocal Rank Fusion algorithms with configurable modality weights (default equal weights) to improve result quality beyond single-modality approaches
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with IRIS Graph Core for native database optimizations including HNSW vector indexing and enhanced text search capabilities
- **FR-007**: System MUST support configurable fusion weights and search parameters to optimize performance for different domain requirements and query patterns
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide comprehensive performance monitoring and benchmarking capabilities to measure and validate performance improvements across different search methods
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure thread-safe operations and implement memory-bounded search result caching with LRU eviction, reusing existing LLM response caching infrastructure for consistent resource management during concurrent multi-modal search requests
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing RAG pipeline interfaces while extending capabilities through the hybrid architecture
