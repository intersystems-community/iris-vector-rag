# Feature Specification: Vector Store Architecture

**Feature Branch**: `004-4-004-vector`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Vector Store Architecture - IRIS vector database abstraction and operations with unified vector database interface and IRIS optimization"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
RAG application developers need a unified vector database interface that abstracts away database-specific operations while providing optimized performance for IRIS vector operations. The system must handle document storage, vector similarity search, and connection management with robust error handling and data consistency guarantees across different deployment scenarios.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a RAG application needs to store documents with embeddings, **When** using the vector store interface, **Then** documents are persisted with proper vector indexing and retrieval capabilities regardless of underlying database implementation
2. **Given** a similarity search query with vector embeddings, **When** executing the search, **Then** the system returns relevant documents ranked by similarity score with consistent performance and accuracy
3. **Given** database connection issues during operations, **When** errors occur, **Then** the system provides clear error categorization and recovery guidance without data corruption or silent failures
4. **Given** large batch document operations, **When** processing multiple documents simultaneously, **Then** the system maintains transaction integrity and provides progress feedback with rollback capabilities on failure
5. **Given** different deployment environments (local, Docker, production), **When** the vector store initializes, **Then** it automatically obtains correct database connection settings from the centralized configuration manager without requiring environment-specific code changes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when vector dimensions don't match the configured embedding model dimensions?
- How does the system handle database connection timeouts during large batch operations?
- What occurs when CLOB data exceeds database storage limits or becomes corrupted?
- How does the system manage concurrent access to the same documents during updates and deletions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a unified interface for vector database operations that abstracts database-specific implementation details
- **FR-002**: System MUST support document storage with associated vector embeddings and metadata with proper indexing for retrieval operations
- **FR-003**: System MUST perform vector similarity search with configurable similarity metrics and result ranking capabilities
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle database connection management with automatic reconnection and connection pooling for optimal performance, using a centralized configuration manager that supports multiple configuration sources including environment variables, configuration files, and defaults
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide comprehensive error handling with specific exception types for different failure scenarios and recovery guidance, including immediate rejection of operations with vector dimension mismatches
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure data consistency and transaction integrity for all database operations including batch processing with retry logic using exponential backoff up to 3 attempts for connection timeouts
- **FR-007**: System MUST focus exclusively on IRIS with deep optimizations including CLOB handling, native vector search capabilities, and HNSW indexing performance characteristics
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide document lifecycle management including creation, updates, deletion, and bulk operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST support configurable vector indexing strategies and similarity search algorithms optimized for different use cases
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure thread-safe operations for concurrent access and provide appropriate locking mechanisms for data integrity
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide consistent configuration management across deployment scenarios (local development, Docker containers, production) with clear precedence rules for configuration sources

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Vector similarity search MUST achieve sub-100ms response times for small datasets (<10K docs) when using IRIS HNSW indexing
- **NFR-002**: Vector similarity search MUST achieve sub-500ms response times for medium datasets (<100K docs) when HNSW index is properly utilized by query planner
- **NFR-003**: System MUST monitor and alert when query planner fails to use HNSW indexes, resulting in degraded performance
- **NFR-004**: Vector dimension validation MUST provide immediate error feedback with detailed mismatch information

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **VectorStore**: Abstract interface defining standard vector database operations for document storage and retrieval
- **IRISVectorStore**: IRIS-specific implementation providing optimized vector operations and CLOB handling capabilities
- **ConnectionManager**: Database connection lifecycle management with pooling and automatic recovery features, integrating with centralized configuration manager for deployment-specific connection settings
- **Document**: Core data structure representing stored documents with content, metadata, and associated vector embeddings
- **VectorStoreExceptions**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy for error handling with specific types for different failure scenarios
- **SearchResult**: Result structure containing retrieved documents with similarity scores and ranking information
- **DimensionValidator**: Component ensuring vector dimensions match configured embedding model requirements
- **BatchRetryManager**: Handles connection timeout recovery with exponential backoff for large batch operations
- **HNSWIndexMonitor**: Monitors IRIS query planner index usage and performance characteristics

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: What should happen when vector dimensions don't match the configured embedding model dimensions? ‚Üí A: Reject operation immediately with detailed dimension mismatch error
- Q: What are the acceptable performance targets for vector similarity search operations? ‚Üí A: Sub-100ms for small datasets (<10K docs), sub-500ms for medium datasets (<100K docs) with IRIS HNSW indexing; much worse performance if index not used
- Q: How should the system handle database connection timeouts during large batch operations? ‚Üí A: Retry entire batch operation with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
- Q: Should the vector store support multiple database backends or focus exclusively on IRIS optimization? ‚Üí A: Focus exclusively on IRIS with deep optimizations and native features

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: How should the vector store obtain and manage database connection configuration across different deployment scenarios? ‚Üí A: Use a centralized configuration manager that supports multiple sources (env vars, config files, defaults)
