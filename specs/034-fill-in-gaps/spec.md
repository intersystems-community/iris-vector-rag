## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **developer or QA engineer**, I need **comprehensive integration tests for all HybridGraphRAG query processing paths** so that **I can have confidence that the system works correctly in all scenarios, including fallback mechanisms when external dependencies fail**.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** HybridGraphRAG pipeline is initialized with iris_graph_core available, **When** a query is executed with `method="hybrid"`, **Then** hybrid fusion search executes successfully and returns relevant documents

2. **Given** HybridGraphRAG pipeline is initialized but iris_graph_core tables are missing (RDF_EDGES, kg_NodeEmbeddings_optimized), **When** a query is executed with `method="hybrid"`, **Then** the system detects 0 results from iris_graph_core and falls back to IRISVectorStore vector search

3. **Given** HybridGraphRAG pipeline is initialized, **When** a query is executed with `method="rrf"`, **Then** Reciprocal Rank Fusion combining vector and text search executes successfully

4. **Given** HybridGraphRAG pipeline is initialized, **When** a query is executed with `method="text"`, **Then** iFind text search executes via iris_graph_core

5. **Given** HybridGraphRAG pipeline is initialized, **When** a query is executed with `method="vector"`, **Then** HNSW-optimized vector search executes

6. **Given** HybridGraphRAG pipeline is initialized, **When** a query is executed with `method="kg"`, **Then** pure knowledge graph traversal executes (inherited from GraphRAGPipeline)

7. **Given** HybridGraphRAG pipeline encounters an exception in any iris_graph_core method, **When** the exception is raised, **Then** the system logs the error and falls back to IRISVectorStore vector search

8. **Given** iris_graph_core is not installed or available, **When** HybridGraphRAG initializes, **Then** it gracefully degrades to standard GraphRAGPipeline functionality

### Edge Cases
- What happens when iris_graph_core returns 0 results but doesn't throw an exception?
- How does the system handle dimension mismatches (768D vs 384D embeddings)?
- What happens when all retrieval methods fail (including fallback)?
- How does the system handle missing required tables (RDF_EDGES, kg_NodeEmbeddings_optimized)?
- What happens when embedding dimensions don't match between query and documents?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Hybrid Fusion Path Coverage
- **FR-001**: Test suite MUST validate that `method="hybrid"` executes multi-modal fusion search when iris_graph_core is available and configured

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **HybridGraphRAG Pipeline**: Enhanced GraphRAG pipeline with iris_graph_core integration supporting 5 query methods (hybrid, rrf, text, vector, kg)
- **Query Method**: Retrieval strategy selected by user (hybrid fusion, RRF, enhanced text, HNSW vector, knowledge graph)
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Automatic degradation to IRISVectorStore vector search when iris_graph_core methods fail or return 0 results
- **iris_graph_core**: External library providing advanced graph operations (HNSW vector search, iFind text search, RRF fusion)
- **IRISVectorStore**: Internal vector store implementation using IRIS database with VECTOR_DOT_PRODUCT for similarity search
- **Test Coverage Gap**: Missing integration tests for specific query paths and fallback scenarios

## Notes

This specification addresses the testing gaps identified during Feature 033 (Fix GraphRAG Vector Retrieval Logic). The existing test suite covers:
- Basic vector search functionality
- Top-K configuration
- Dimension validation
- RAGAS evaluation

This feature will add comprehensive coverage for:
- All 5 HybridGraphRAG query methods
- Fallback mechanisms when iris_graph_core fails
- Error handling for missing tables and dimension mismatches
- Integration testing for end-to-end query flows

**Success Metric**: Test suite achieves 100% coverage of all HybridGraphRAG query processing paths with passing tests for all 28 functional requirements.
