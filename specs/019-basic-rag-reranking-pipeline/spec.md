# BasicRAG Reranking Pipeline Specification

## Overview
The BasicRAG Reranking Pipeline extends the standard BasicRAG approach by implementing a two-stage retrieval system: initial retrieval using vector similarity search followed by reranking using more sophisticated relevance models. This approach improves retrieval quality by combining the efficiency of vector search with the precision of cross-encoder reranking models.

## Primary User Story
RAG system users and developers need improved retrieval quality beyond basic vector similarity while maintaining reasonable performance characteristics. The reranking pipeline should provide better context relevance, improved answer quality, and enhanced retrieval precision through post-retrieval reranking, particularly for complex queries where vector similarity alone may not capture nuanced semantic relationships.

## Acceptance Scenarios

### AC-001: Two-Stage Retrieval Process
**GIVEN** a user query requiring contextual information
**WHEN** the BasicRAG Reranking Pipeline processes the query
**THEN** the system first retrieves a larger set of candidate documents using vector similarity
**AND** applies a reranking model to score and reorder the candidates based on query-context relevance
**AND** returns the top-k most relevant documents after reranking

### AC-002: Configurable Reranking Models
**GIVEN** different use cases with varying accuracy and performance requirements
**WHEN** the pipeline is configured with different reranking models
**THEN** the system supports multiple reranking approaches (cross-encoder, ColBERT, custom models)
**AND** allows configuration of model parameters and scoring thresholds
**AND** provides consistent interfaces regardless of the underlying reranking model

### AC-003: Performance-Quality Trade-offs
**GIVEN** performance requirements and quality expectations
**WHEN** the pipeline processes queries with different urgency levels
**THEN** the system provides configurable candidate set sizes for initial retrieval
**AND** supports fast reranking for real-time applications and comprehensive reranking for batch processing
**AND** maintains acceptable response times while improving retrieval quality

### AC-004: Quality Improvement Measurement
**GIVEN** queries processed through both BasicRAG and BasicRAG Reranking
**WHEN** the results are compared using evaluation metrics
**THEN** the reranking pipeline demonstrates measurable improvement in context relevance
**AND** provides better answer quality as measured by RAGAS metrics
**AND** shows improved precision and recall compared to vector-only retrieval

### AC-005: Fallback and Error Handling
**GIVEN** reranking model failures or performance issues
**WHEN** the reranking process encounters errors or exceeds 100ms timeout thresholds
**THEN** the system gracefully falls back to basic vector retrieval results
**AND** logs reranking failures with comprehensive details for monitoring and debugging
**AND** maintains service availability while attempting to use reranking when possible
