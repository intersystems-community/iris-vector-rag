# Feature Specification: Memory Knowledge Extraction System

**Feature Branch**: `005-6-006-memory`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Memory Knowledge Extraction - Incremental learning and temporal knowledge management with continuous learning and knowledge evolution capabilities"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
RAG application developers need a memory system that continuously learns from user interactions and document processing, extracting reusable knowledge patterns while managing temporal information across different time windows. The system must enable knowledge evolution through incremental updates without losing historical context or degrading performance over time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** new documents are added to the RAG system, **When** the incremental learning manager processes them, **Then** knowledge patterns are extracted and integrated without requiring full system reindexing or data rebuilding
2. **Given** RAG responses contain entities and relationships, **When** the knowledge extractor processes responses, **Then** structured knowledge patterns are identified and stored for future retrieval and reasoning
3. **Given** temporal context queries spanning different time periods, **When** users request historical information, **Then** the temporal manager provides relevant knowledge based on configurable time windows and retention policies
4. **Given** evolving knowledge patterns over time, **When** similar concepts are encountered again, **Then** the system leverages learned patterns to improve response quality and consistency

### Edge Cases
- What happens when incremental updates conflict with existing knowledge patterns?
- How does the system handle temporal queries that span across retention policy boundaries?
- What occurs when knowledge extraction performance degrades below acceptable thresholds?
- How does the system manage memory growth and cleanup of obsolete temporal data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support incremental learning from new documents and user interactions without requiring full knowledge base rebuilding
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract knowledge patterns including entities, relationships, and concepts from RAG responses with configurable extraction methods
- **FR-003**: System MUST manage temporal knowledge across different time windows with configurable retention policies and expiration handling
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide change detection capabilities to identify knowledge updates and modifications efficiently, resolving conflicts by merging patterns using confidence scores and temporal relevance
- **FR-005**: System MUST support knowledge pattern clustering and deduplication to prevent redundant storage and improve retrieval accuracy
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain performance targets of under 50 milliseconds per RAG response for knowledge extraction operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide temporal context retrieval with relevance scoring and filtering capabilities across different time periods
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle knowledge evolution by updating existing patterns while preserving historical relationships and context
- **FR-009**: System MUST support configurable temporal windows based on application requirements with default suggestions for short-term, medium-term, and long-term knowledge retention
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide integration capabilities with existing RAG pipelines and vector storage systems without disrupting operations

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Memory usage MUST be configurable based on available system resources, typically 10-50% of total RAM
- **NFR-002**: System MUST trigger cleanup of obsolete temporal data when memory usage exceeds 80% of configured limits
- **NFR-003**: Knowledge extraction operations MUST maintain sub-50ms performance regardless of memory usage levels
- **NFR-004**: System MUST provide memory monitoring and alerting capabilities for operational visibility

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **IncrementalLearningManager**: Core component managing continuous knowledge updates and change detection from document streams
- **KnowledgePatternExtractor**: Engine for identifying and extracting structured knowledge patterns from unstructured RAG responses
- **TemporalMemoryManager**: System managing time-based knowledge storage with configurable retention policies and temporal queries
- **KnowledgePattern**: Structured representation of extracted knowledge including entities, relationships, and confidence scores
- **TemporalWindow**: Time-based categorization system for organizing knowledge across short-term, medium-term, and long-term contexts
- **MemoryItem**: Generic memory structure supporting different types of knowledge with metadata and temporal associations
- **ConflictResolver**: Component managing knowledge pattern conflicts using confidence scores and temporal relevance
- **MemoryMonitor**: System monitoring memory usage and triggering cleanup operations at configured thresholds
- **TemporalConfigManager**: Manages configurable temporal window settings with application-specific defaults
