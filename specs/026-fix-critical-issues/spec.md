```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Description: Fix critical issues identified by /analyze command
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Developers, CI/CD system
   → Actions: Add missing tasks, implement coverage warnings, validate TDD compliance
   → Data: Coverage thresholds, error messages, contract test results
   → Constraints: Must follow TDD principles, maintain constitution compliance
   → Note: This feature implements pure pytest tooling and does not require IRIS database
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Coverage warning implementation approach not specified
   → Error message format standards not specified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary: Developer sees coverage warnings during test runs
   → Secondary: Contract tests validate TDD compliance
5. Generate Functional Requirements

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT developers need: automated compliance checking
- ✅ Focus on WHY: ensure testing framework follows constitutional principles
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement: specific pytest plugins, warning mechanisms

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the RAG-Templates testing framework, I need automated warnings and validations to ensure I'm following constitutional principles (TDD, coverage requirements, error handling) so that:
- I get immediate feedback when coverage drops below thresholds
- I can't accidentally violate TDD by implementing before tests
- All error messages provide actionable information
- The framework enforces its own quality standards

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a test suite with modules below 60% coverage, **When** I run pytest with coverage, **Then** I see warnings for each module below threshold with specific coverage percentages

2. **Given** a module designated as "critical" (pipelines, storage, validation), **When** its coverage falls below 80%, **Then** the test run warns me about critical module coverage violation

3. **Given** contract tests that should fail first per TDD, **When** I run the validation, **Then** the system verifies contract tests were in a failing state before implementation

4. **Given** a test failure in the framework, **When** I read the error message, **Then** I understand exactly what failed, why it failed, and what action to take

5. **Given** the analyze command identified missing tasks, **When** I update tasks.md, **Then** all functional requirements have corresponding implementation tasks

### Edge Cases
- What happens when coverage calculation fails or .coverage file is corrupted? (warn once and continue)
- How does the system handle contract tests that never failed (violation of TDD)? (fail CI build)
- What happens when error messages exceed 1000 characters? (truncate with "..." indicator)
- How are "critical modules" determined if not explicitly configured?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Coverage Warning System
- **FR-001**: Test suite MUST warn when any module falls below 60% coverage during test execution
- **FR-002**: Test suite MUST warn when critical modules (iris_rag/pipelines/, iris_rag/storage/, iris_rag/validation/) fall below 80% coverage
- **FR-003**: Coverage warnings MUST include module name, current coverage percentage, and target threshold
- **FR-004**: Coverage warnings MUST appear in test output without failing the test run (warnings, not errors)
- **FR-005**: System MUST identify critical modules through configuration file patterns in .coveragerc

#### Error Message Standards
- **FR-006**: All test failures MUST provide error messages with three components: what failed, why it failed, suggested action
- **FR-007**: Error messages MUST include relevant context (test name, assertion details, actual vs expected values)
- **FR-008**: Error messages MUST follow a consistent format across all test types (unit, integration, E2E)
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate error message quality through automated pytest plugin with configurable regex patterns

#### TDD Compliance Validation
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that contract tests existed in a failing state before implementation
- **FR-011**: Validation MUST check git history or test execution logs to verify contract tests failed initially
- **FR-012**: System MUST report TDD violations with specific test names and implementation commits
- **FR-013**: TDD validation MUST run as part of CI pipeline on every PR
- **FR-017**: TDD violations MUST fail the CI build to enforce compliance

#### Task Completeness
- **FR-014**: All functional requirements in spec.md MUST have at least one corresponding task in tasks.md
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate requirement-to-task mapping and report gaps
- **FR-016**: Edge cases defined in spec.md MUST have corresponding test tasks

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: All validation tools combined MUST add less than 5 seconds overhead to test execution time
- **NFR-002**: Validators MUST handle repositories with up to 1000 modules without significant performance degradation (overhead must remain under 10 seconds total, max 2x slowdown compared to 100 module baseline)
- **NFR-003**: Error message truncation MUST preserve the most important context (what/why/action structure)

### Key Entities *(mandatory - compliance data involved)*

- **Coverage Warning**: Represents a coverage threshold violation. Has attributes: module_path, current_coverage, threshold, severity (normal/critical), timestamp.

- **Error Message Validation**: Validates test failure messages meet standards. Has attributes: test_name, error_message, has_what, has_why, has_action, validation_status.

- **Contract Test State**: Tracks TDD compliance for contract tests. Has attributes: test_file, initial_state (pass/fail/error), implementation_commit, compliance_status.

- **Requirement Task Mapping**: Links requirements to implementation tasks. Has attributes: requirement_id, task_ids[], coverage_status, validation_timestamp.

## Clarifications Resolved

All clarifications have been addressed in the Clarifications section above:

2. ✅ **Error Message Validation**: Already resolved - using automated pytest plugin with regex patterns (FR-009)
3. ✅ **TDD Validation Timing**: Resolved - CI pipeline only (FR-013)
4. ✅ **Error Message Length**: Resolved - 1000 character limit with truncation
5. ✅ **Coverage Failure Handling**: Resolved - warn once and continue
6. ✅ **TDD Violation Handling**: Resolved - fail CI build

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: When should the TDD compliance validation run to catch violations? → A: CI pipeline only
- Q: What should be the maximum character limit for error messages before truncation? → A: 1000 characters
- Q: When coverage calculation fails (e.g., corrupted .coverage file), what should the system do? → A: Warn once - show single error, continue
- Q: How should the system handle contract tests that never failed (TDD violation)? → A: Fail CI build - enforce TDD strictly
- Q: What is the acceptable performance overhead for all validators combined during test runs? → A: < 5 seconds total overhead

## Context from Analyze Command

**Critical Issues Found** (from analyzing feature 025):
- FR-007 from feature 025 spec had no implementation task (coverage threshold warnings) - addressed by this feature's FR-001 through FR-005
- FR-013 from feature 025 spec had no implementation task (clear error messages) - addressed by this feature's FR-006 through FR-009
- Constitution TDD violation: contract tests must fail before implementation
- Missing tasks for edge case testing scenarios

**Specific Gaps to Address**:
1. No pytest plugin/hook to warn on low coverage
2. No validation that error messages are actionable
3. No verification that contract tests failed first
4. Edge cases defined but not tested
