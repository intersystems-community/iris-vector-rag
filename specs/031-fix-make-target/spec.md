   ‚Üí Data: Pipeline list from iris_rag factory
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must work without manual Makefile updates
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED] All aspects clear from context
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User runs make test-ragas-sample and all available pipelines are tested
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable via make execution and RAGAS output
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Pipeline types (data entities from factory)
7. Run Review Checklist

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer running RAGAS evaluations, when I execute `make test-ragas-sample`, the system should automatically test all currently available RAG pipelines without requiring me to manually update the Makefile whenever pipelines are added or removed.

**Current Problem**: The Makefile hardcodes a pipeline list that becomes outdated when:
- New pipelines are added to the factory
- Pipeline names change
- Pipelines are temporarily disabled
- This leads to failed evaluations or missing coverage

**Desired Outcome**: The make target queries the iris_rag factory for the current list of available pipelines and uses that list dynamically.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer has just added a new pipeline to iris_rag factory, **When** they run `make test-ragas-sample`, **Then** the new pipeline is automatically included in the RAGAS evaluation without modifying the Makefile

2. **Given** the iris_rag factory has 5 available pipelines, **When** a developer runs `make test-ragas-sample`, **Then** all 5 pipelines are tested and results appear in the RAGAS report

3. **Given** a pipeline name has been changed in the factory, **When** a developer runs `make test-ragas-sample`, **Then** the evaluation uses the new name automatically without Makefile changes

4. **Given** a pipeline has been temporarily removed from the factory, **When** a developer runs `make test-ragas-sample`, **Then** the evaluation skips that pipeline without errors

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the factory has zero available pipelines? (Should fail with clear error message)
- What happens when a pipeline is listed but fails to initialize? (Should report failure for that specific pipeline, continue with others)
- What happens if a user manually overrides with `RAGAS_PIPELINES` env var? (Should respect user override)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST dynamically query iris_rag factory for the current list of available pipeline types at evaluation time

- **FR-002**: System MUST use the factory's pipeline list as the default when `RAGAS_PIPELINES` environment variable is not set

- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve user's ability to override the pipeline list via `RAGAS_PIPELINES` environment variable

- **FR-004**: System MUST fail with a clear error message if no pipelines are available from the factory

- **FR-005**: System MUST test all available pipelines when developer runs `make test-ragas-sample` without environment variable overrides

- **FR-006**: System MUST NOT require Makefile modifications when new pipelines are added to the iris_rag factory

- **FR-007**: System MUST report which pipelines were tested in the evaluation output

- **FR-008**: System MUST handle pipeline initialization failures gracefully, continuing to test remaining pipelines

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Pipeline Type**: A string identifier representing an available RAG pipeline (e.g., "basic", "crag", "graphrag")
  - Attributes: name, availability status
  - Source: iris_rag factory's available_types list
  - Lifecycle: Defined at factory level, queried at runtime

- **RAGAS Evaluation**: A test execution that evaluates multiple pipelines
  - Attributes: pipelines tested, results per pipeline, timestamp
  - Relationships: Tests multiple Pipeline Types

## Additional Context

### Current State
The Makefile currently hardcodes:
```
export RAGAS_PIPELINES=${RAGAS_PIPELINES:-"basic,basic_rerank,crag,graphrag,pylate_colbert"};
```

This list becomes stale when:
- The factory adds/removes pipelines
- Pipeline names change
- Pipelines are refactored

### Business Impact
**Problem**: Developers waste time manually syncing Makefile with factory changes, leading to:
- Missed test coverage (new pipelines not evaluated)
- Broken CI/CD (references to removed pipelines)
- Developer friction (extra manual step for every pipeline change)

**Value**: Automatic pipeline discovery reduces maintenance overhead and ensures complete test coverage without manual coordination.

### Success Metrics
- Zero Makefile updates required when adding new pipelines
- RAGAS evaluation coverage matches factory availability (100%)
- Clear error messages when pipeline count is unexpected
