# Feature Specification: Bring Your Own Table (BYOT) System

**Feature Branch**: `014-byot-as-described`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "BYOT as described: BYOT (Bring Your Own Table) Implementation - The bring your own table functionality in the RAG framework is implemented through the custom table support in the IRISVectorStore class. Users can specify their own table by configuring the storage:iris:table_name setting to point to their existing table, enabling zero-copy RAG capabilities on existing business data without migration."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: What happens when a custom table has incompatible column structures? ‚Üí A: Allow configuration of custom column mappings
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent access between existing applications and RAG operations? ‚Üí A: Read-only RAG access with no coordination needed
- Q: What performance targets should the system meet for RAG operations on custom tables? ‚Üí A: Same as default RAG tables (sub-200ms response)
- Q: What user roles need different access levels to BYOT configuration? ‚Üí A: System administrator and database administrator
- Q: How should the system handle validation failures when custom tables are inaccessible? ‚Üí A: fail with error
- Q: How does the system handle custom tables with incompatible column structures or data types? ‚Üí A: Fail immediately with detailed error message
- Q: What occurs when table names contain patterns that could be used for SQL injection attacks? ‚Üí A: Block request and log security violation
- Q: How does the system handle performance impact when multiple concurrent read operations access the same custom table? ‚Üí A: Rely on IRIS database built-in concurrency handling

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Enterprise organizations with existing business data in IRIS database tables need to add RAG capabilities to their data without copying, migrating, or disrupting existing applications. System administrators and database administrators must be able to configure their existing tables as data sources for RAG operations while maintaining data integrity, security, and compatibility with current business processes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an organization has existing business documents in a custom IRIS table, **When** they configure the RAG system to use their table as a data source, **Then** the system validates the table name for security and enables RAG operations without data migration or copying
2. **Given** a custom table is configured for RAG operations, **When** users perform semantic searches and document retrieval, **Then** the system operates on the existing data with full RAG capabilities including vector search, filtering, and answer generation
3. **Given** security requirements for enterprise environments, **When** users specify custom table names, **Then** the system validates table names against SQL injection patterns and enforces naming conventions to prevent malicious access
4. **Given** existing applications using the business table, **When** RAG capabilities are enabled, **Then** existing applications continue to function without disruption while new RAG features become available

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a specified custom table doesn't exist or is inaccessible? (System fails with error message)
- How does the system handle custom tables with incompatible column structures or data types? ‚Üí System fails immediately with detailed error message specifying required column types and structure
- What occurs when table names contain patterns that could be used for SQL injection attacks? ‚Üí System blocks the request immediately and logs security violation with details for monitoring
- How does the system handle performance impact when multiple concurrent read operations access the same custom table? ‚Üí System relies on IRIS database built-in concurrency handling and optimization capabilities

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow system administrators and database administrators to configure custom table names through configuration settings, replacing default RAG tables with existing business tables
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate custom table names against security patterns including SQL injection prevention and naming convention enforcement, blocking requests immediately and logging security violations with details for monitoring when malicious patterns are detected
- **FR-003**: System MUST support existing tables that follow the schema.table naming format with alphanumeric characters and underscores only
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing applications by operating as a read-only overlay without modifying original table structures or data, ensuring no coordination is needed for concurrent access
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide zero-copy RAG capabilities on custom tables without requiring data migration, duplication, or transformation
- **FR-006**: System MUST enforce security through pattern validation, dangerous keyword detection, and whitelist-based filtering for query operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST support multiple table types including document storage, token embeddings, test data, and backup tables through configurable table name mappings
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate that custom tables have compatible column structures and support configurable column mappings to map business table columns to the Document model with id, content, and metadata fields
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear error messages and validation feedback when custom table configurations are invalid, pose security risks, when tables are inaccessible, or when custom tables have incompatible column structures or data types, failing operations immediately with detailed error messages specifying required column types and structure rather than providing degraded service
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with existing RAG pipeline operations while using custom tables as the underlying data source
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain performance targets equivalent to default RAG tables with sub-200ms response times for RAG operations on custom tables, relying on IRIS database built-in concurrency handling and optimization capabilities for multiple concurrent read operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **CustomTableConfiguration**: Configuration mapping that specifies which existing business table to use for RAG operations with validation and security settings
- **TableNameValidator**: Security component that validates custom table names against SQL injection patterns, naming conventions, and dangerous keyword lists
- **BusinessDataAdapter**: Interface layer that maps existing business table structures to RAG Document model requirements without data transformation
- **SecurityWhitelist**: Approved filter keys and patterns that can be used for querying custom tables without compromising data integrity
- **TableCompatibilityChecker**: Validation system that ensures custom tables have the necessary column structure and data types for RAG operations
- **ZeroCopyRAGOverlay**: Operational layer that provides full RAG capabilities on existing business data without requiring migration or duplication
