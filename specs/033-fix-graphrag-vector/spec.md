# Feature Specification: Fix GraphRAG Vector Retrieval Logic

**Feature Branch**: `033-fix-graphrag-vector`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: User description: "fix GraphRAG vector retrieval logic: The schema is now healthy, but GraphRAG's vector search retrieval logic is broken. Despite having valid data (2,376 documents with embeddings), all vector searches return 0 results. This is a separate issue from the schema initialization and requires investigation into the GraphRAG retrieval implementation."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: Should all 4 issues (vector search, entity linking, entity embeddings, communities) be fixed in this single feature? → A: Option A - Fix only vector search retrieval (FR-001 to FR-005) - critical blocker only
- Q: What minimum performance should RAGAS evaluation achieve after fixing vector search? → A: Context precision >30%, context recall >20% (modest improvement)
- Q: What is the minimum number of documents that should be retrieved (top-K value)? → A: K is configurable; default K=10 for testing

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature: Fix GraphRAG vector search returning 0 results
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: GraphRAG pipeline, vector search system
   → Actions: Vector search retrieval, document embedding lookup
   → Data: 2,376 documents with embeddings in RAG.SourceDocuments
   → Constraints: Schema is healthy, embeddings exist, but retrieval returns empty
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is expected retrieval success rate?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should all 4 remaining issues be fixed in this feature?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User queries GraphRAG → expects relevant documents → currently gets 0 results
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Vector search MUST return documents when embeddings exist
   → Each requirement must be testable via RAGAS evaluation
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Documents, embeddings, entities, relationships, communities
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - scope needs clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a **researcher using GraphRAG**, I want to **query the knowledge graph with natural language questions** so that **I receive relevant documents and entities that answer my question**, enabling me to get accurate, context-aware answers from the biomedical literature corpus.

### Current State
- **Given** GraphRAG has 2,376 documents with embeddings stored in the database
- **And** knowledge graph contains 22,305 entities and 90,298 relationships
- **When** a user queries "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"
- **Then** vector search returns 0 documents
- **And** user receives "No relevant documents found to answer the query"
- **Result**: 0% context precision, 0% context recall, 14.4% overall performance

### Desired State (After Fix)
- **Given** GraphRAG has documents with embeddings
- **When** a user queries with a biomedical question
- **Then** vector search returns the top-K most relevant documents
- **And** user receives an answer synthesized from retrieved context
- **Result**: Context precision >30%, context recall >20%, overall performance improves from 14.4% baseline

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Basic Vector Search
1. **Given** 2,376 documents exist with valid embeddings in RAG.SourceDocuments
2. **When** user queries "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"
3. **Then** vector search retrieves up to K=10 most similar documents (configurable)
4. **And** response includes document content and metadata
5. **And** at least 1 document is relevant to the query


### Edge Cases
- What happens when query embedding generation fails?
- How does system handle queries with no semantically similar documents?
- What if document embeddings are corrupted or have wrong dimensions?
- What if database connection fails during vector search?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Vector Search Core (Critical - Blocking)
- **FR-001**: Vector search MUST return documents when matching embeddings exist in RAG.SourceDocuments
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve top-K most similar documents based on embedding similarity, where K is configurable (default K=10)
- **FR-003**: Retrieval MUST work with the existing 384-dimensional all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings
- **FR-004**: System MUST log detailed diagnostic information when vector search returns 0 results
- **FR-005**: Vector search MUST validate embedding dimensions match before querying
- **FR-006**: Top-K parameter MUST be configurable via system configuration

#### Entity-Document Linking (High Priority - Out of Scope)
- **FR-007**: System MUST link entities to their source documents via document_id field
- **FR-008**: Entity extraction MUST populate document_id during ingestion
- **FR-009**: System MUST support filtering entities by source document
- **FR-010**: Orphaned entities MUST be identified and reportable for debugging

#### Entity Embeddings (Medium Priority - Out of Scope)
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate vector embeddings for extracted entities
- **FR-012**: Entity embeddings MUST be generated from entity name + description text
- **FR-013**: System MUST support entity-level semantic search
- **FR-014**: Hybrid retrieval MUST combine document and entity embeddings

#### Community Detection (Medium Priority - Out of Scope)
- **FR-015**: System MUST populate RAG.Communities table via community detection algorithm
- **FR-016**: Communities MUST be hierarchically organized (hierarchy_level field)
- **FR-017**: Community summaries MUST be generated for cluster descriptions
- **FR-018**: Retrieval MUST leverage community structure for broad queries

#### Validation & Testing (In Scope)
- **FR-019**: RAGAS evaluation MUST show context precision >30% after vector search fix
- **FR-020**: RAGAS evaluation MUST show context recall >20% after vector search fix
- **FR-021**: All queries in test set MUST retrieve at least 1 document when relevant content exists
- **FR-022**: Overall RAGAS performance MUST improve from 14.4% baseline

### Scope Boundaries

**In Scope (Feature 033)**:
- Fix vector search retrieval logic (FR-001 to FR-006) - critical blocker only
- Ensure existing documents with embeddings are retrievable
- Make top-K configurable (default K=10)
- Validate fixes via RAGAS evaluation (FR-019 to FR-022)
- Achieve context precision >30%, context recall >20%

**Out of Scope (Future Features)**:
- Entity-document linking (FR-007 to FR-010) → Feature 034
- Entity embeddings (FR-011 to FR-014) → Feature 035
- Community detection (FR-015 to FR-018) → Feature 036

**Rationale**: Phased approach allows incremental validation and focuses this feature on the critical blocker preventing any document retrieval.

### Key Entities

- **Document**: Biomedical research paper with text content and vector embedding (384D)
- **Entity**: Extracted concept (gene, disease, protein) with optional embedding, linked to source document
- **Relationship**: Connection between two entities (e.g., "treats", "causes")
- **Community**: Cluster of related entities with hierarchical level and summary
- **Query**: User's natural language question to be answered via RAG retrieval
- **Embedding**: Vector representation (384D) for semantic similarity search

## Implementation Summary

**Status**: ✅ Complete (2025-10-07)

### Root Cause Analysis
Investigation revealed that HybridGraphRAGPipeline (the new GraphRAG implementation) relies on the `iris-vector-graph` external library for advanced retrieval. The library's vector search returned 0 results because:
- Expected schema: `kg_NodeEmbeddings_optimized`, `SQLUSER.RDF_EDGES` tables
- Expected dimensions: 768D (BERT-base) embeddings
- Actual schema: `RAG.SourceDocuments` table
- Actual dimensions: 384D (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) embeddings

### Solution Implemented
Modified HybridGraphRAGPipeline to detect when `iris-vector-graph` returns 0 results and automatically fall back to IRISVectorStore.similarity_search():

**Files Modified**:
- `iris_rag/pipelines/hybrid_graphrag.py:243-324` - Added fallback logic to 4 retrieval methods:
  - `_retrieve_via_hybrid_fusion()` - Hybrid multi-modal fusion search
  - `_retrieve_via_rrf()` - Reciprocal Rank Fusion
  - `_retrieve_via_enhanced_text()` - iFind text search
  - `_retrieve_via_hnsw_vector()` - HNSW-optimized vector search
- `iris_rag/pipelines/graphrag.py:672-689` - Enhanced diagnostic logging in `_fallback_to_vector_search()`

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
# Check for 0 results
if not documents:
    logger.warning("Method returned 0 results. Falling back to vector search.")
    fallback_docs = self._fallback_to_vector_search(query_text, top_k)
    return fallback_docs, "vector_fallback"
```

### Test Coverage
Created 29 contract tests across 5 test files:
- `tests/contract/test_vector_search_contract.py` - 6 tests (FR-001, FR-002, FR-003)
- `tests/contract/test_dimension_validation_contract.py` - 6 tests (FR-005)
- `tests/contract/test_ragas_validation_contract.py` - 8 tests (FR-019-022)
- `tests/contract/test_diagnostic_logging_contract.py` - 9 tests (FR-004)
- `tests/integration/test_graphrag_vector_search.py` - 7 integration tests
