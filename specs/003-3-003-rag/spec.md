# Feature Specification: RAG Pipeline Factory System

**Feature Branch**: `003-3-003-rag`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "RAG Pipeline Factory System - Pipeline creation, validation, and lifecycle management with automated pipeline deployment and requirement validation"

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
RAG framework developers and system administrators need a factory system that creates pipeline instances with comprehensive validation, automated setup orchestration, and lifecycle management. The system must ensure pipelines have all required data dependencies before deployment and provide clear error reporting with actionable setup guidance when requirements are missing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer requests a new BasicRAG pipeline, **When** the factory validates requirements, **Then** the system checks for required tables and embeddings and either creates the pipeline or provides specific setup instructions
2. **Given** missing vector embeddings for a pipeline type, **When** auto-setup is enabled, **Then** the orchestrator automatically generates required embeddings and creates necessary database structures
3. **Given** a pipeline deployment with invalid configuration, **When** validation runs, **Then** the system provides clear error messages with specific remediation steps and prevents faulty pipeline creation
4. **Given** a multi-stage setup process, **When** orchestration executes, **Then** the system tracks progress, handles failures gracefully, and provides rollback capabilities for partial setups

### Edge Cases
- What happens when pipeline requirements conflict with existing database schema?
- How does the system handle validation failures during automated setup orchestration?
- What occurs when a pipeline type has circular dependencies between requirements?
- How does the factory manage concurrent pipeline creation requests with overlapping resource needs?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate all pipeline requirements before instance creation including table existence, data completeness, and embedding availability
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide automated setup orchestration to generate missing embeddings and create required database structures
- **FR-003**: System MUST produce comprehensive validation reports with specific failure details and actionable remediation guidance
- **FR-004**: System MUST support multiple pipeline types with different requirement sets and validation rules
- **FR-005**: System MUST track setup progress with detailed logging and provide rollback capabilities for failed operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST perform pre-condition checks to ensure data integrity and completeness before pipeline activation
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle configuration management integration to resolve pipeline-specific settings and dependencies
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide lifecycle management including pipeline creation, validation, setup, and decommissioning
- **FR-009**: System MUST support both manual validation mode and automated setup mode with configurable behavior
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure thread-safe operations using database-level locking to prevent resource conflicts and fail fast for blocked requests

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Setup orchestration timeouts MUST be configurable based on operation complexity and system capacity
- **NFR-002**: System MUST provide timeout configuration for different operation types (basic validation, embedding generation, database operations)
- **NFR-003**: Partial setup failures MUST result in continued operation with partial functionality and detailed recovery instruction logging

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ValidatedPipelineFactory**: Central factory component responsible for creating pipeline instances with comprehensive validation
- **PreConditionValidator**: Validation engine that checks table existence, data completeness, and requirement satisfaction
- **SetupOrchestrator**: Automated setup system that generates missing embeddings and creates required database structures
- **ValidationReport**: Structured report containing validation results, failure details, and remediation suggestions
- **SetupProgress**: Progress tracking system for multi-step setup operations with timing and status information
- **PipelineLifecycleManager**: Component managing the complete lifecycle from validation through decommissioning
- **ResourceLockManager**: Database-level locking system preventing resource conflicts during concurrent pipeline creation
- **PartialStateManager**: Component handling partial setup failures with degraded functionality and recovery guidance

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: What should happen when multiple concurrent pipeline creation requests compete for the same database resources? ‚Üí A: Use database-level locking to prevent conflicts and fail fast for blocked requests
- Q: What are the acceptable timeout limits for automated setup orchestration operations? ‚Üí A: Configurable timeouts based on operation complexity and system capacity
- Q: How should the system handle partial setup failures when rollback is not possible? ‚Üí A: Continue with partial functionality and log detailed recovery instructions
