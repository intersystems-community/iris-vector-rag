## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Knowledge workers and AI system developers need sophisticated semantic reasoning capabilities that can load and process domain-specific ontologies, perform automated inference to discover implicit relationships, and expand queries with contextually relevant concepts. The system must support multiple ontology formats and provide intelligent reasoning to enhance knowledge discovery beyond simple keyword matching or basic entity recognition.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** domain-specific ontology files in OWL, RDF, or SKOS formats, **When** the system loads these ontologies, **Then** the system extracts concepts, relationships, and hierarchies while validating data integrity and preventing circular dependencies
2. **Given** a knowledge graph with explicit relationships, **When** the reasoning engine processes the ontology, **Then** the system infers new relationships through subsumption reasoning, transitive closure, and property reasoning with confidence scores and reasoning traces
3. **Given** user queries with domain-specific terminology, **When** the query expansion system operates, **Then** the system expands queries with synonyms, related concepts, and semantically similar terms based on ontological relationships and hierarchies
4. **Given** multiple ontology sources and reasoning operations, **When** the system processes complex semantic relationships, **Then** the system maintains performance targets and provides detailed inference results with provenance information and confidence metrics

### Edge Cases
- What happens when ontology files contain circular dependencies or malformed relationships? ‚Üí System attempts automatic repair using heuristic conflict resolution to maintain operational functionality
- How does the system handle very large ontologies that exceed memory or processing limits? ‚Üí System implements lazy loading with on-demand concept resolution to manage memory efficiently
- What occurs when reasoning operations produce conflicting inferences or contradictory relationships? ‚Üí System uses confidence scores to select the highest-probability inference and resolve conflicts automatically
- How does the system manage performance when processing complex multi-level hierarchical reasoning chains? ‚Üí System uses breadth-first search with priority-based concept ordering to optimize traversal performance

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST load and parse ontology files in multiple formats including OWL (Web Ontology Language), RDF (Resource Description Framework), and SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) with comprehensive validation
- **FR-002**: System MUST perform automated semantic reasoning including subsumption inference, transitive closure computation, and property-based relationship discovery with configurable reasoning depth limits (to be determined through research)
- **FR-003**: System MUST expand user queries with semantically related concepts, synonyms, and hierarchical terms based on loaded ontology knowledge with confidence scoring and relevance ranking
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect circular dependencies and malformed relationships in concept hierarchies and attempt automatic repair using heuristic conflict resolution while providing detailed validation reports
- **FR-005**: System MUST support domain-agnostic ontology integration allowing medical, legal, financial, technical, and other specialized knowledge domains with appropriate concept type mapping
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain performance targets of processing ontologies with up to 10,000 concepts using lazy loading with on-demand concept resolution for memory efficiency and response time optimization
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide comprehensive inference tracing showing reasoning paths, confidence scores, and provenance information for all automated relationship discoveries with conflict resolution using highest-probability inference selection
- **FR-008**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with existing entity extraction and knowledge graph systems while maintaining data consistency and relationship integrity
- **FR-009**: System MUST support external identifier mapping including UMLS codes, SNOMED terms, and other standardized concept identifiers for interoperability with existing knowledge systems
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide flexible concept hierarchy navigation with ancestor and descendant relationship queries supporting multi-level traversal using breadth-first search with priority-based concept ordering and semantic similarity computation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **OntologyLoader**: Multi-format ontology processing system supporting OWL, RDF, and SKOS with validation, concept extraction, and hierarchy construction capabilities
- **OntologyReasoner**: Semantic inference engine performing subsumption reasoning, transitive closure, query expansion, and relationship discovery with configurable reasoning strategies
- **ConceptHierarchy**: Structured representation of ontological knowledge supporting concept relationships, hierarchical navigation, and semantic similarity computation
- **SemanticMapping**: Integration component mapping ontology concepts to entity extraction systems and knowledge graph structures with confidence scoring and type resolution
- **InferenceEngine**: Automated reasoning system applying rules and constraints to discover implicit relationships with detailed tracing and confidence assessment
- **QueryExpander**: Semantic query enhancement system leveraging ontological knowledge to expand user queries with related concepts, synonyms, and contextual terms
