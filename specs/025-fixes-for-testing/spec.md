**Input**: User description: "fixes for testing framework to improve coverage and functional correctness"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input

   → Actors: Developers, CI/CD system
   → Actions: Fix failing tests, improve coverage, ensure correctness
   → Data: Test results (60 failed, 11 errors), coverage metrics (10%)
   → Constraints: Must maintain passing tests, no breaking changes
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Target coverage percentage not specified
   → Priority order of test fixes not specified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary: Developer runs tests and sees all pass
   → Secondary: Coverage reports show improvement
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Fix 60 failing E2E tests (API mismatches)
   → Fix 11 GraphRAG test errors (setup issues)
   → Improve coverage metrics
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Test cases, Coverage reports, API contracts

8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT developers need: reliable, passing tests
- ✅ Focus on WHY: enable confident code changes and refactoring
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement: specific test frameworks, assertion libraries

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the RAG-Templates codebase, I need all tests to pass reliably so that I can:
- Confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality
- Trust the test suite to catch regressions
- Understand test coverage to identify untested code paths
- Run tests quickly as part of my development workflow

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the test suite with 60 failing E2E tests, **When** I run the complete test suite, **Then** all tests pass or skip intentionally (no failures or errors)

2. **Given** API mismatches between tests and production code, **When** tests are updated to match actual implementations, **Then** tests accurately validate production behavior

3. **Given** GraphRAG tests with setup errors, **When** I run GraphRAG-related tests, **Then** tests either pass with proper setup or skip with clear explanations

4. **Given** E2E tests for vector store operations, **When** I execute vector search tests, **Then** tests correctly validate IRIS vector search functionality (TO_VECTOR with DOUBLE datatype)

5. **Given** test coverage reports showing 10% coverage, **When** I review coverage by module, **Then** I can identify which modules need additional tests

### Edge Cases
- What happens when IRIS database connection fails during tests?
- How does the system handle pytest-randomly seed issues (known issue with numpy)?
- What happens when tests run without proper PYTHONPATH configuration?
- How are tests isolated to prevent database state pollution between test cases?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Test Correctness
- **FR-001**: Test suite MUST eliminate all 60 failing E2E tests through API alignment or proper skipping
- **FR-002**: Test suite MUST fix all 11 GraphRAG test errors by resolving setup/dependency issues
- **FR-003**: Tests MUST accurately reflect actual production API contracts (no mock-based assumptions)
- **FR-004**: Vector store tests MUST correctly validate IRIS TO_VECTOR behavior (DOUBLE datatype, no parameter markers)
- **FR-005**: Tests MUST run without pytest-randomly when it causes seed errors with numpy/thinc

#### Test Coverage
- **FR-006**: Test suite MUST provide coverage reports showing line-by-line coverage percentages
- **FR-007**: Coverage reports MUST identify modules with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target coverage threshold - 60%? 80%?]
- **FR-008**: Tests MUST cover critical paths in BasicRAG, CRAG, and GraphRAG pipelines
- **FR-009**: Tests MUST validate vector search, entity extraction, and document storage operations

#### Test Reliability
- **FR-010**: Tests MUST run consistently across multiple executions (no flaky tests)
- **FR-011**: Tests MUST properly clean up database state to prevent cross-test pollution
- **FR-012**: Tests MUST execute in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable time limit - 2 minutes? 5 minutes? 10 minutes?]
- **FR-013**: Tests MUST provide clear failure messages indicating what broke and why

#### Test Organization
- **FR-014**: Unit tests MUST test components in isolation with minimal dependencies
- **FR-015**: E2E tests MUST validate full pipeline workflows with real IRIS database
- **FR-016**: Tests MUST clearly document when they require external dependencies (IRIS, LLM APIs)
- **FR-017**: Skipped tests MUST include skip reasons explaining why they're disabled

#### Coverage Improvement
- **FR-018**: Test suite MUST achieve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target overall coverage - 60%? higher?]
- **FR-019**: Critical modules MUST achieve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target critical module coverage - 80%?]
- **FR-020**: Tests MUST prioritize coverage of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which modules are considered critical?]

### Key Entities *(mandatory - test data involved)*

- **Test Case**: Represents a single test execution with setup, action, assertion, and cleanup phases. Has attributes: name, status (pass/fail/skip/error), execution time, coverage contribution.

- **Coverage Report**: Aggregates coverage data showing lines covered, missed, and percentage per module. Related to test executions that contribute coverage.

- **API Contract**: Defines expected behavior of production code (e.g., BasicRAGPipeline.load_documents accepts documents kwarg, returns None). Tests validate contracts.

- **Test Fixture**: Provides reusable test setup including database connections, pipelines, sample documents. Scoped at function, class, or module level.

- **Mock/Real Dependency**: Tests use either mocked dependencies (unit tests) or real dependencies (E2E tests). Choice affects what the test validates.

## Clarifications Needed

1. **Target Coverage Percentage**: What is the acceptable overall coverage target? (Current: 10%, Industry standard: 60-80%)

2. **Critical Module Coverage**: What coverage threshold should critical modules achieve? (Suggestion: 80% for pipelines, storage, validation)

3. **Test Execution Time Limit**: What is the maximum acceptable time for the full test suite to run? (Current: ~106 seconds for 206 tests)

## Current State Summary (for context)

**Test Results (as of 2025-10-03)**:
- 206 passing tests ✅
- 5 skipped tests (intentional) ✅
- 60 failed tests (API mismatches) ❌
- 11 errors (GraphRAG setup issues) ❌

**Coverage**:
- Overall: 10% (1,199/11,470 lines)
- Codebase reduced from 12,791 → 11,470 lines after dead code cleanup

**Known Issues**:
- pytest-randomly causes numpy/thinc seed errors (must run with `-p no:randomly`)
- Vector store tests need IRIS TO_VECTOR with DOUBLE datatype
- Many E2E tests have API mismatches (test expectations vs actual implementation)
- GraphRAG tests have setup/dependency issues
