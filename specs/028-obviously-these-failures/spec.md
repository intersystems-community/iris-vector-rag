# Feature Specification: Test Infrastructure Resilience and Database Schema Management

**Feature Branch**: `028-obviously-these-failures`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "obviously these failures are due to a gap in our specs!! let's fix this"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   â†’ Identified: Test suite failures due to infrastructure gaps
2. Extract key concepts from description
   â†’ Actors: Test runner, Database, Schema manager
   â†’ Actions: Reset schema, validate tables, cleanup test state
   â†’ Data: Database tables (SourceDocuments, DocumentChunks, Entities, Relationships)
   â†’ Constraints: Must not affect production, must be idempotent
3. For each unclear aspect:
   â†’ [RESOLVED: Analysis shows 69 errors from schema mismatch, 47 from unimplemented MCP, 218 cascading failures]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   â†’ Clear user flow: Developer runs tests â†’ schema conflicts â†’ tests fail
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   â†’ Each requirement is testable via pytest
6. Identify Key Entities
   â†’ Database schema, Test fixtures, Cleanup handlers
7. Run Review Checklist
   â†’ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   â†’ Implementation details intentionally included (this is infrastructure)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer running the test suite, I need the database schema to be automatically managed and reset between test runs so that schema conflicts never cause test failures and I can trust the test results represent actual code issues, not infrastructure problems.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a fresh IRIS database instance, **When** tests run for the first time, **Then** all required tables are created with correct schema and all 771 tests execute without schema errors

2. **Given** tables exist from a previous test run with outdated schema, **When** tests run again, **Then** schema is automatically detected as stale, tables are dropped and recreated, and tests proceed without errors

3. **Given** multiple test sessions run concurrently, **When** each session needs clean database state, **Then** each session gets isolated schema or proper cleanup without interfering with other sessions

4. **Given** a test fails midway leaving partial data, **When** next test runs, **Then** database state is cleaned up and test starts fresh

5. **Given** MCP contract tests that expect unimplemented modules, **When** these tests run, **Then** they are properly marked as "expected failures" or "skipped" rather than causing ERROR status

### Edge Cases
- What happens when IRIS database is not running? â†’ Tests should skip with clear message, not error
- What happens when schema version changes between runs? â†’ Auto-detection and migration or clean rebuild
- What happens when table drop fails? â†’ Retry with CASCADE or fail clearly with actionable message
- How does system handle partial schema (some tables exist, some don't)? â†’ Validate all tables, recreate incomplete sets

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Database Schema Management
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect when database tables exist with incompatible schema before running tests
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide automatic schema reset functionality that drops and recreates all RAG tables (SourceDocuments, DocumentChunks, Entities, Relationships)
- **FR-003**: Schema reset MUST be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate table schema matches expected structure before allowing tests to proceed
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear error messages when database is unavailable, including actionable remediation steps

#### Test Isolation and Cleanup
- **FR-006**: Each test class MUST have access to clean database state via pytest fixtures
- **FR-007**: Test fixtures MUST automatically cleanup database state after test completion (success or failure)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support test-level transaction rollback for fast cleanup
- **FR-009**: Cleanup operations MUST handle partial data (documents without embeddings, entities without relationships)
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent test data pollution between test runs

#### Contract Test Management
- **FR-011**: Contract tests for unimplemented features (MCP modules) MUST be marked with `@pytest.mark.contract`
- **FR-012**: Contract test failures MUST not contribute to overall test failure count when feature is known to be unimplemented
- **FR-013**: System MUST distinguish between "expected contract failures" (TDD) and "actual bugs"
- **FR-014**: Contract tests MUST provide clear messages indicating they are testing future functionality

#### Test Execution Reliability
- **FR-015**: Test suite MUST provide pre-flight checks that validate all prerequisites (database, API keys, schema)
- **FR-016**: System MUST fail fast with clear messages when prerequisites are not met
- **FR-017**: Database connection failures MUST be caught at setup phase, not during individual tests
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide utility to reset entire test environment to known-good state

#### Medical-Grade Quality Standards
- **FR-019**: Schema management operations MUST be logged with timestamps and outcomes for audit trail
- **FR-020**: System MUST track which schema version each test run used
- **FR-021**: Failed schema operations MUST provide full diagnostic information (table name, SQL attempted, error code)
- **FR-022**: System MUST validate that cleanup operations actually removed all test data before marking as complete

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Schema reset operation MUST complete in under 5 seconds for all 4 tables
- **NFR-002**: Test isolation overhead MUST add less than 100ms per test class
- **NFR-003**: Pre-flight checks MUST complete in under 2 seconds
- **NFR-004**: Error messages MUST include specific SQLCODE and remediation steps
- **NFR-005**: System MUST handle 100% of known schema conflict scenarios without manual intervention

### Key Entities

- **DatabaseSchema**: Represents the expected structure of RAG tables (SourceDocuments, DocumentChunks, Entities, Relationships) including column names, types, and indexes
- **SchemaValidator**: Validates actual database tables against expected schema, detecting mismatches
- **TestFixtureManager**: Manages database state for test isolation, provides clean state for each test
- **ContractTestMarker**: Identifies and manages tests that are expected to fail (TDD contract tests)
- **PreflightChecker**: Validates all prerequisites before test execution (database connectivity, schema validity, API keys)
- **CleanupHandler**: Ensures database is cleaned after each test, handles partial data scenarios

## Analysis Summary

Based on test run of 771 tests:
- **69 ERRORS**: Database schema mismatch (SQLCODE -29: Field not found)
- **47 ERRORS**: Unimplemented MCP modules (expected TDD contract test failures)
- **218 FAILED**: Cascading failures from database setup errors
- **476 PASSED**: Including 100% of Feature 026 quality framework tests
- **8 SKIPPED**: Properly handled optional tests

**Root Cause**: No automated schema management or contract test handling in test infrastructure.

**Impact**: ~90% of test failures will resolve with proper schema reset and contract test marking.

**Priority**: CRITICAL - blocking medical-grade quality validation
