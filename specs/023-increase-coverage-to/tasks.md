# Tasks: Comprehensive Test Coverage Enhancement to 60%+

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/023-increase-coverage-to/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Tech stack: Python 3.12, pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio, coverage.py
   → Structure: Single project - Python framework package
2. Load optional design documents: ✓
   → data-model.md: 4 entities (CoverageReport, ModuleCoverage, TestSuite, CoverageTrend)
   → contracts/: coverage-api.yaml with 5 endpoints, test_coverage_api.py contract tests
   → quickstart.md: 7 test scenarios extracted from user stories
3. Generate tasks by category: Coverage infrastructure, priority module testing, system implementation
4. Apply task rules: Different files = [P], TDD approach, critical modules first
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Dependencies: Setup → Tests → Implementation → Integration → Validation
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `tests/`, `iris_rag/` at repository root
- Paths shown below follow existing project structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Infrastructure
- [x] T000 Configure uv package management environment per constitution v1.6.0 requirements (deprecates pip/virtualenv workflows)
- [x] T001 Enhance test configuration in tests/conftest.py with coverage fixtures and IRIS database setup
- [x] T002 [P] Create coverage analysis utilities in iris_rag/testing/coverage_analysis.py using uv for package management per constitutional requirement (replace pip/virtualenv patterns)
- [x] T003 [P] Create coverage reporting system in iris_rag/testing/coverage_reporter.py
- [x] T004 [P] Create coverage validation framework in iris_rag/testing/coverage_validator.py

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
**CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT: Verify all contract tests fail with NotImplementedError before proceeding to Phase 3.3**

### Contract Tests (from coverage-api.yaml)
- [x] T007 [P] Contract test POST /coverage/analyze in tests/contract/test_coverage_analyze.py

## Coverage Targets by Module
- **iris_rag.config**: 80% (critical - T016, T025.1, T035)
- **iris_rag.validation**: 80% (critical - T017, T036)
- **iris_rag.pipelines**: 80% (critical - T018, T037)
- **iris_rag.services**: 80% (critical - T019, T038)
- **iris_rag.storage**: 80% (critical - T020, T039)
- **iris_rag.core**: 60% (baseline)
- **iris_rag.testing**: 60% (new module)
- **Overall**: ≥60% target

## Performance Requirements
- Coverage analysis: ≤5 minutes (T052)
- Test execution overhead: ≤2x baseline (T047)
- Report generation: ≤30 seconds (T052, T056)
- Memory usage: Reasonable bounds (T047)

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task completion
- Follow TDD: red → green → refactor cycle
- Critical modules (config, validation, pipelines, services, storage) must reach 80%
- Legacy modules may have reduced targets with documented exemptions

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**: 5 contract tests (T007-T011) from coverage-api.yaml endpoints
2. **From Data Model**: 4 model tasks (T026-T029) from entities in data-model.md
3. **From User Stories**: 7 integration tests (T021-T025, T048-T050) from quickstart scenarios
4. **From Clarifications**: Priority module testing (T016-T020, T035-T039) based on config/validation first requirement

## Validation Checklist
- ✓ All 5 contracts have corresponding tests (T007-T011)
- ✓ All 4 entities have model tasks (T026-T029)
- ✓ All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 before 3.3)
- ✓ Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files)
- ✓ Each task specifies exact file path
- ✓ No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- ✓ Critical modules prioritized (config, validation first)
- ✓ 60%+ overall coverage target achievable
- ✓ 80% critical module coverage targets defined
