**Feature Branch**: `023-increase-coverage-to`
**Created**: October 2, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "increase coverage to at least 60%"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Clear goal: achieve minimum 60% test coverage across codebase
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, CI/CD systems, QA teams, project maintainers
   ‚Üí Actions: create tests, measure coverage, improve quality, ensure reliability
   ‚Üí Data: test results, coverage metrics, test configurations, code modules
   ‚Üí Constraints: must reach 60% minimum, maintain existing functionality, improve reliability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific target modules vs overall coverage percentage]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: timeline requirements for achieving 60% coverage]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Development workflow scenarios for coverage improvement identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements focused on measurable coverage targets and test quality
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Test suites, coverage reports, test configurations, code modules
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and focused on developer/maintainer needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: What coverage percentage should critical core modules achieve? ‚Üí A: 80% - High reliability target
- Q: What is the acceptable time limit for coverage analysis to complete? ‚Üí A: 5 minutes - Balanced thoroughness and speed
- Q: How frequently should coverage trend tracking be reported? ‚Üí A: Monthly - Milestone reporting
- Q: Which modules should be prioritized to reach 80% coverage first? ‚Üí A: Configuration and validation modules, then pipeline components and services
- Q: How should the system handle legacy code modules that are difficult to test? ‚Üí A: Lower coverage targets for legacy modules

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team working on the RAG templates framework, we need to achieve at least 60% test coverage across the codebase so that we can confidently deploy changes, catch regressions early, maintain high code quality, and meet industry standards for production software.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current test suite coverage is below 60%, **When** developers run the full test suite, **Then** coverage reports show at least 60% overall coverage with detailed module-level metrics
2. **Given** a developer makes code changes, **When** they run tests locally, **Then** coverage tools provide immediate feedback on coverage impact and identify uncovered code paths
3. **Given** the CI/CD pipeline runs tests, **When** coverage analysis completes, **Then** the system reports coverage percentage and fails builds that drop below the 60% threshold
4. **Given** a new feature is developed, **When** tests are written for the feature, **Then** the feature achieves at least 80% coverage to maintain or improve overall coverage
5. **Given** critical system components exist, **When** coverage analysis runs, **Then** core modules show higher coverage percentages than the 60% minimum requirement

### Edge Cases
- Legacy code modules that are difficult to test receive lower coverage targets with documented justification rather than universal 60% requirement
- How does the system handle coverage measurement for integration vs unit tests?
- What occurs when external dependencies cannot be mocked for testing?
- How are async components and complex pipeline workflows measured for coverage?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Test suite MUST achieve at least 60% overall code coverage across the entire iris_rag package
- **FR-002**: Coverage measurement MUST provide detailed module-level reporting showing which files meet or exceed coverage targets
- **FR-003**: Critical core modules MUST achieve 80% coverage targets, with configuration and validation modules prioritized first, followed by pipeline components and services
- **FR-004**: Test suite MUST include comprehensive unit tests for all major service classes and pipeline components
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide coverage reporting that identifies specific uncovered code paths and functions
- **FR-006**: Coverage tools MUST integrate with CI/CD pipeline to enforce coverage requirements automatically
- **FR-007**: Test suite MUST maintain or improve coverage percentage when new code is added
- **FR-008**: Coverage measurement MUST exclude test files themselves and focus on source code coverage
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide monthly coverage trend tracking to monitor improvement over time through milestone reporting
- **FR-010**: Test suite MUST cover error handling paths and edge cases in addition to happy path scenarios
- **FR-011**: Coverage reporting MUST distinguish between different types of coverage (line, branch, function)
- **FR-012**: System MUST support selective coverage measurement for specific modules or packages
- **FR-013**: Legacy code modules that are difficult to test MUST be assigned lower coverage targets with documented justification

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Coverage analysis MUST complete within 5 minutes to balance thoroughness and speed for developer feedback
- **PR-002**: Test execution with coverage measurement MUST not exceed 2x the time of tests without coverage
- **PR-003**: Coverage reports MUST generate within reasonable time bounds for developer feedback loops

### Quality Requirements
- **QR-001**: Test suite MUST achieve the 60% coverage target through meaningful tests that validate actual functionality
- **QR-002**: Coverage improvement MUST not sacrifice test quality or introduce flaky tests
- **QR-003**: Test suite MUST maintain deterministic results while achieving coverage targets
- **QR-004**: Coverage reports MUST be accurate and reflect true code path execution

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Suite**: Complete collection of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests covering the codebase
- **Coverage Report**: Detailed analysis showing percentage coverage by module, file, and function with uncovered line identification
- **Coverage Configuration**: Settings and rules defining coverage targets, exclusions, and measurement parameters
- **Test Module**: Individual test files and test classes organized by functionality and coverage area
- **Code Module**: Source code files and packages being measured for test coverage
- **Coverage Metrics**: Quantitative measurements including line coverage, branch coverage, and function coverage percentages
