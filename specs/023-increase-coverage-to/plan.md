# Implementation Plan: Comprehensive Test Coverage Enhancement to 60%+

**Branch**: `023-increase-coverage-to` | **Date**: 2025-10-02 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/023-increase-coverage-to/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Achieve at least 60% overall test coverage across the iris_rag package with critical core modules reaching 80% coverage. Implement comprehensive test suite with coverage reporting, CI/CD integration, and monthly trend tracking. Prioritize configuration/validation modules first, then pipeline components and services, with differentiated targets for legacy code.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.12 (existing project)
**Primary Dependencies**: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio, unittest.mock, coverage.py
**Storage**: IRIS Database (vector operations, document storage) + test fixtures
**Testing**: pytest with coverage analysis, async test support, CI/CD integration
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS development environments, CI/CD pipelines
**Project Type**: single - Python framework package
**Performance Goals**: Coverage analysis within 5 minutes, test execution <2x baseline time
**Constraints**: 60% minimum overall coverage, 80% for critical modules, maintain test quality
**Scale/Scope**: ~12,000 lines of code across iris_rag package, 54+ existing tests to expand

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. Framework-First Architecture**: ✓ Test framework enhances existing RAGPipeline architecture | ✓ Framework-level testing utilities | ✓ CLI integration via Make targets

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure focused on test enhancement. The existing iris_rag package structure remains unchanged, with comprehensive test coverage added across the existing tests/ directory structure. Priority modules (config, validation, pipelines, services, storage) will receive focused testing to reach 80% coverage first.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Coverage API contracts → contract test implementation tasks [P]
- Data entities (CoverageReport, ModuleCoverage, TestSuite, CoverageTrend) → model creation tasks [P]
- Quickstart scenarios → integration test tasks matching user stories
- Implementation tasks to make failing contract tests pass
- Priority module testing (config/validation first, then pipelines/services/storage)

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Test Infrastructure Setup** [P]:
   - Enhanced conftest.py with coverage fixtures
   - Test runner scripts with coverage integration
   - CI/CD workflow for coverage enforcement

2. **Priority Module Coverage** (Sequential by priority):
   - Configuration module tests (iris_rag.config) → 80% target
   - Validation module tests (iris_rag.validation) → 80% target
   - Pipeline component tests (iris_rag.pipelines) → 80% target
   - Services module tests (iris_rag.services) → 80% target
   - Storage module tests (iris_rag.storage) → 80% target

3. **Coverage System Implementation** [P]:
   - Coverage analysis engine implementation
   - Report generation (terminal, HTML, XML formats)
   - Trend tracking and milestone reporting
   - Legacy module exemption handling

4. **Integration & Validation**:
   - End-to-end coverage workflow testing
   - Performance validation (5-minute analysis time)
   - CI/CD integration validation
   - Quickstart scenario validation

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → failing tests → implementation
- Priority order: Critical modules (config, validation) before regular modules
- Dependency order: Core models → services → integration → validation
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files/modules)

**Estimated Output**: 55-60 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md
- ~8 infrastructure setup tasks
- ~20 priority module coverage tasks (4 per module)
- ~10 coverage system implementation tasks
- ~8 integration and validation tasks
- ~5 documentation and CI/CD tasks
- ~4 constitutional compliance tasks

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
