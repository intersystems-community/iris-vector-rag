# Feature Specification: Repository Cleanup and Organization

**Feature Branch**: `037-clean-up-this`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "clean up this repo: remove or move any unnecessary files at the top level; remove or move/reorganize any poorly organized files throughout the repo; goal is to not have any extraneous files, but also must run all the tests to make sure nothing needed is removed"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: cleanup scope (top-level + throughout repo), constraints (must not break tests)
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, maintainers
   ‚Üí Actions: identify, move, remove, reorganize
   ‚Üí Data: files, directories
   ‚Üí Constraints: preserve functionality (all tests must pass)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What constitutes "unnecessary" - temporary files, old reports, duplicate docs?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should archived/historical files be moved to archive/ or deleted?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should generated output files (RAGAS reports, eval results) be removed or archived?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary: Developer navigates cleaner repository structure
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable via: file existence checks, test suite execution
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Files, Directories, Test Suite
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - clarification needed on cleanup criteria"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the rag-templates project, I want a clean and well-organized repository structure so that I can easily find relevant files, understand the project layout, and avoid confusion from outdated or temporary files cluttering the workspace.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a repository with multiple files at the top level, **When** I view the repository root, **Then** I should see only essential files (README, configuration, entry points) with all other files organized into appropriate directories

2. **Given** a repository with test files throughout, **When** the cleanup is completed, **Then** all tests must still pass with 100% of the previous test coverage maintained

3. **Given** a repository with generated output files and reports, **When** cleanup is performed, **Then** old evaluation reports (RAGAS HTML/JSON, pipeline verification outputs) should be removed as they are regeneratable and outdated

4. **Given** a repository with documentation files, **When** reorganization is complete, **Then** all documentation should be in consistent locations (docs/, top-level guides) with no duplicates

5. **Given** a repository with status tracking files, **When** cleanup decisions are made, **Then** current status files (docs/docs/STATUS.md, docs/docs/PROGRESS.md, docs/docs/TODO.md, docs/docs/docs/CHANGELOG.md) should be moved to docs/ directory and old session notes/completion summaries should be deleted

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a file appears unnecessary but is actually imported or referenced by tests?
- How does the system handle files that serve multiple purposes (e.g., both documentation and test data)?
- What if removing files breaks implicit dependencies not caught by the test suite?
- How are files with unclear purpose categorized (e.g., various SUMMARY.md, REPORT.md files)? ‚Üí Keep newest, delete older duplicates

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### File Organization
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify all files at the repository root level
- **FR-002**: System MUST categorize top-level files into: essential (keep), relocatable (move), unnecessary (remove)
- **FR-003**: System MUST move relocatable files to appropriate subdirectories based on their purpose (docs/, archive/, outputs/)
- **FR-004**: System MUST remove unnecessary files in these categories:
  - a) Temporary/cache files (*.pyc, __pycache__, .pytest_cache, .coverage)
  - b) Old evaluation reports in outputs/ directories (RAGAS HTML/JSON reports)
  - c) Duplicate documentation files (multiple SUMMARY.md, REPORT.md files)
  - f) Historical status tracking files (old session notes, completion summaries)
  Note: Build artifacts (.egg-info, dist/, build/) and editor files (.vscode, .idea, *.swp) are already in .gitignore and not tracked

#### Directory Structure
- **FR-005**: System MUST organize documentation files into a consistent structure (top-level user guides, technical docs in docs/)
- **FR-006**: System MUST consolidate duplicate documentation files by keeping the most recently modified version and deleting older duplicates
- **FR-007**: System MUST remove generated outputs (evaluation results, old reports, test outputs) and historical tracking files as they are regeneratable or no longer needed
- **FR-008**: System MUST move status tracking files (docs/docs/STATUS.md, docs/docs/PROGRESS.md, docs/docs/TODO.md, docs/docs/docs/CHANGELOG.md) to docs/ directory

#### Quality Assurance
- **FR-009**: System MUST run the complete test suite after any file removal or relocation
- **FR-010**: System MUST verify 100% of tests that passed before cleanup still pass after cleanup
- **FR-011**: System MUST report any test failures and rollback changes if tests fail
- **FR-012**: System MUST preserve all files referenced by passing tests

#### Validation
- **FR-013**: System MUST check for broken documentation links after file reorganization
- **FR-014**: System MUST verify all import statements still resolve after file movements
- **FR-015**: System MUST ensure configuration files (docker-compose, .env.example, pytest.ini) remain functional

#### Documentation
- **FR-016**: System MUST update any documentation that references moved or removed files
- **FR-017**: System MUST update DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md to reflect new file locations

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Cleanup MUST be reversible (via git history) in case issues are discovered later
- **NFR-002**: Cleanup MUST maintain test pass rate (100% of previously passing tests must still pass; code coverage percentage may vary)
- **NFR-003**: Organization MUST follow [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: is there a standard Python project structure to follow?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Top-Level File**: File located at repository root; categorized as essential (README.md, setup.py), configuration (.gitignore, docker-compose.yml), or relocatable
- **Documentation File**: Markdown or text file providing project information; stored in root or docs/ based on audience and currency
- **Generated Output**: Files created by test runs, evaluations, or scripts (to be removed during cleanup)
- **Current Status File**: Active project tracking files (docs/docs/STATUS.md, docs/docs/PROGRESS.md, docs/docs/TODO.md, docs/docs/docs/CHANGELOG.md) - kept if actively maintained
- **Historical Report**: Completion summaries, validation reports, session notes (to be deleted during cleanup)
- **Test Suite**: Collection of test files whose execution validates that no required files were removed

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

### Clarifications Needed

1. ‚úÖ **Unnecessary File Criteria**: RESOLVED - Remove: a) temporary/cache files, b) old evaluation reports, c) duplicate documentation, f) historical status tracking
2. ‚úÖ **Archive vs Delete**: RESOLVED - Delete historical files entirely (no archive needed)
3. ‚úÖ **Generated Outputs**: RESOLVED - Remove old RAGAS reports and evaluation results (regeneratable)
4. ‚úÖ **Status Files**: RESOLVED - Move docs/docs/STATUS.md, docs/docs/PROGRESS.md, docs/docs/TODO.md, docs/docs/docs/CHANGELOG.md to docs/ directory
5. ‚úÖ **Coverage Threshold**: RESOLVED - No specific coverage threshold; all tests must pass but coverage % may vary
6. **Project Structure Standard**: Should the repo follow a specific Python project convention (src-layout, flat-layout)?
7. ‚úÖ **Duplicate Handling**: RESOLVED - Keep most recently modified version, delete older duplicates
