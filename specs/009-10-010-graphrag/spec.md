## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Knowledge workers and RAG application developers need a sophisticated knowledge extraction system that automatically identifies entities and relationships within documents, then uses graph traversal methods to discover relevant information connections. The system must support domain-agnostic ontology integration and provide graph-based reasoning capabilities to find documents through entity relationships rather than just similarity matching.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** documents are loaded into the system, **When** entity extraction processes the content, **Then** the system identifies structured entities with types, relationships, and confidence scores while storing them in a knowledge graph for future retrieval
2. **Given** a user query with entity references, **When** the GraphRAG pipeline processes the query, **Then** the system finds seed entities, traverses relationship networks, and retrieves documents based on knowledge graph connections rather than simple vector similarity
3. **Given** domain-specific ontology configuration, **When** entity extraction operates, **Then** the system applies ontology-aware extraction with semantic reasoning to identify domain-relevant entities and their hierarchical relationships
4. **Given** insufficient knowledge graph data for a query, **When** GraphRAG validation runs, **Then** the system provides explicit error messages about missing entities or relationships rather than falling back to basic vector search

### Edge Cases
- What happens when entity extraction fails completely during document loading? ‚Üí System stores documents without entities, enables basic vector fallback, and issues extraction failure warnings to maintain operational continuity
- How does the system handle queries for entities that don't exist in the knowledge graph? ‚Üí System falls back to basic vector search with entity-not-found warning to maintain query functionality
- What occurs when graph traversal finds no connected entities within the specified depth limits? ‚Üí System returns partial results from shallower traversal levels with depth-limit-reached notification
- How does the system manage performance when the knowledge graph becomes very large with complex relationship networks? ‚Üí System implements graph pruning to remove low-confidence entities and relationships, maintaining performance while preserving high-quality connections

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST extract structured entities from documents including entity types, confidence scores, and position information with support for domain-agnostic ontology integration
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify and store relationships between entities based on co-occurrence patterns and ontological reasoning with configurable relationship types
- **FR-003**: System MUST perform knowledge graph validation to ensure sufficient entity and relationship data exists before allowing GraphRAG queries
- **FR-004**: System MUST execute graph traversal retrieval using seed entity discovery, configurable multi-hop relationship navigation (default 3-hop depth), and document association to find relevant content
- **FR-005**: System MUST support configurable ontology plugins for different domains including medical, legal, financial, and technical knowledge areas
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide explicit warnings when knowledge graph data is insufficient and fall back to vector search for entity-not-found scenarios while maintaining fail-hard validation for critical knowledge graph integrity issues
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain response time targets of under 3 seconds for graph traversal queries including multi-hop entity relationship navigation
- **FR-008**: System MUST support semantic reasoning and entity enrichment through ontology hierarchies and relationship inference
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with existing document storage while maintaining knowledge graph consistency and entity-document linkage
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide comprehensive extraction metadata including confidence scores, extraction methods, and ontology mapping information
- **FR-011**: System MUST implement graph pruning strategies with configurable confidence score thresholds to remove low-confidence entities and relationships for maintaining performance in large knowledge graphs
