## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
RAG application users and developers need an intelligent retrieval system that automatically evaluates the quality of initial document retrieval and applies corrective measures to improve answer accuracy. The system must detect when retrieved documents are highly relevant, somewhat relevant, or not relevant, then take appropriate corrective actions including enhanced retrieval strategies or knowledge base expansion to ensure optimal answer quality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a query with clearly relevant documents in the knowledge base, **When** the system evaluates retrieval quality as confident, **Then** the system uses the initial retrieved documents without modification to generate high-quality answers
2. **Given** a query with moderately relevant documents, **When** the system evaluates retrieval quality as ambiguous, **Then** the system enhances retrieval with additional chunk-based search strategies to improve document relevance
3. **Given** a query with poor initial retrieval results, **When** the system evaluates retrieval quality as disoriented, **Then** the system performs knowledge base expansion using broader search strategies to find more relevant information
4. **Given** any query processed through the corrective pipeline, **When** generating the final answer, **Then** the system provides confidence indicators and metadata about the correction methods applied

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all retrieval strategies fail to find relevant documents? ‚Üí System generates answer from available context with low confidence warning using specialized prompts for low-relevance scenarios
- How does the system handle evaluation failures during the correction process? ‚Üí System logs evaluation failure and proceeds with original retrieval results without correction
- What occurs when enhanced retrieval or knowledge base expansion significantly increases response time?
- How does the system manage queries where correction methods produce conflicting results?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST evaluate initial document retrieval quality using configurable similarity score thresholds and relevance criteria, gracefully handling evaluation failures by logging errors and proceeding with original retrieval results
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically classify retrieval results as confident, ambiguous, or disoriented based on document relevance evaluation
- **FR-003**: System MUST apply appropriate corrective actions including enhanced retrieval, chunk-based search, and knowledge base expansion based on evaluation results
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide fallback strategies when primary corrective actions fail to improve document relevance, including generating answers from available context with low confidence warnings using specialized prompts for low-relevance scenarios
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain response time targets of under 5 seconds including all correction phases and enhanced retrieval operations, with configurable timeouts for correction operations (default 10 seconds) before falling back to simpler responses
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate answers with confidence indicators that reflect the retrieval evaluation status and correction methods applied
- **FR-007**: System MUST support configurable evaluation thresholds and correction strategies to accommodate different domain requirements
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide comprehensive metadata including initial retrieval results, correction methods used, and final document counts
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure data consistency when performing enhanced retrieval and knowledge base expansion operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with existing vector store and embedding systems while providing enhanced correction capabilities

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **CRAGPipeline**: Core corrective RAG implementation that orchestrates retrieval evaluation and correction workflows
- **RetrievalEvaluator**: Component responsible for assessing document relevance quality and determining confidence levels for retrieved results
- **CorrectionEngine**: System that applies appropriate corrective actions based on evaluation results including enhanced retrieval and expansion strategies
- **RetrievalStatus**: Classification system with confident, ambiguous, and disoriented states representing document relevance quality
- **EnhancedRetrieval**: Correction mechanism that performs additional chunk-based searches and improved document ranking for ambiguous cases
- **KnowledgeBaseExpansion**: Correction mechanism that performs broader semantic searches and alternative retrieval strategies for disoriented cases

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-28
- Q: What should happen when all retrieval strategies fail to find relevant documents? ‚Üí A: Generate answer from available context with low confidence warning
- Q: What should be the maximum timeout for enhanced retrieval operations before falling back to simpler responses? ‚Üí A: 10 seconds seems ok
- Q: How should the system handle evaluation failures during the correction process? ‚Üí A: Log failure and proceed with original retrieval results
- Q: What similarity score thresholds should be used for confident/ambiguous/disoriented classifications? ‚Üí A: CRAG paper thresholds: (0.59, -0.99) for PopQA tasks
