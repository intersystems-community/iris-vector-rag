## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: What similarity threshold should be used when no documents meet the minimum relevance criteria? ‚Üí A: Return empty results with clear message
- Q: How should the system handle document chunks that exceed the maximum context window of the language model? ‚Üí A: Skip oversized chunks with warning
- Q: What should happen when reranking fails or times out during query processing? ‚Üí A: Log warning and proceed with degraded results
- Q: How should the system behave when the language model is unavailable for answer generation? ‚Üí A: Return only retrieved documents without answers
- Q: What default document chunk size should be used for optimal performance? ‚Üí A: 500

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
RAG application developers and end users need a foundational retrieval-augmented generation system that performs standard vector similarity search to find relevant documents and generates natural language answers. The system must support both basic vector retrieval and advanced reranking capabilities to improve answer quality while maintaining fast response times and reliable document processing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** documents are loaded into the system, **When** a user submits a query, **Then** the system retrieves the most relevant documents using vector similarity search and generates a comprehensive answer based on the retrieved context
2. **Given** a query with multiple relevant document candidates, **When** reranking is enabled, **Then** the system applies cross-encoder reranking to improve document relevance ordering before generating the final answer
3. **Given** documents of various sizes and formats, **When** the system processes them for storage, **Then** large documents are automatically chunked with appropriate overlap while preserving context and metadata for retrieval
4. **Given** users need different response formats, **When** querying the system, **Then** users can choose to get just retrieved documents, just the generated answer, or complete responses with sources and metadata

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no documents match the query above the similarity threshold? (Return empty results with clear message)
- How does the system handle very long documents that exceed chunking limits? (Skip oversized chunks with warning)
- What occurs when the reranking process fails or times out during query processing? (Log warning and proceed with degraded results)
- How does the system manage queries when the language model is unavailable for answer generation? (Return only retrieved documents without answers)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support document ingestion with automatic text chunking using configurable chunk size (default 500 characters) and overlap parameters, skipping oversized chunks that exceed language model context limits with appropriate warnings
- **FR-002**: System MUST perform vector similarity search to retrieve the most relevant documents based on query embeddings
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate natural language answers using retrieved document context and configurable prompt templates, gracefully degrading to document-only responses when language model is unavailable
- **FR-004**: System MUST support optional reranking functionality using cross-encoder models to improve document relevance ordering, gracefully degrading to original retrieval order with logging when reranking fails or times out
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide multiple query interfaces including full RAG responses, document retrieval only, and answer generation only
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle various document formats and automatically extract metadata including source files and chunk information
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain response time targets of under 2 seconds for queries with up to 10 retrieved documents
- **FR-008**: System MUST support configurable similarity thresholds and metadata filtering for document retrieval, returning empty results with clear messaging when no documents meet minimum relevance criteria
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide comprehensive response metadata including execution times, document counts, and processing statistics
- **FR-010**: System MUST support both automated embedding generation and manual document storage for different ingestion workflows
