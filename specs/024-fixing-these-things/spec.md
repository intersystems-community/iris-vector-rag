# Feature Specification: RAG-Templates Quality Improvement Initiative

**Feature Branch**: `024-fixing-these-things`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "fixing these things: üìâ Quality Assessment: Test Results: - 105 failed out of 349 tests (~30% failure rate) - 237 passed - 7 skipped..."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: Fix failing tests, improve coverage, stabilize APIs
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: test failures, coverage gaps, API drift, technical debt
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Defined development team scenarios for quality improvement
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Test suites, coverage metrics, API contracts
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team, we need to improve the quality and reliability of the rag-templates framework by fixing failing tests, increasing code coverage, and ensuring APIs are stable and well-tested, so that we can confidently deploy this framework to production and maintain it over time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current test suite with 105 failing tests, **When** a developer runs the test suite, **Then** all tests should pass (100% pass rate)
2. **Given** the current 9% code coverage, **When** coverage analysis is run, **Then** overall coverage should meet or exceed 60%
3. **Given** critical modules with 8-12% coverage, **When** coverage is measured for config/validation/pipelines/services/storage modules, **Then** each should have at least 80% coverage
4. **Given** misaligned tests and implementations, **When** a developer modifies code, **Then** corresponding tests should automatically validate the changes
5. **Given** no CI/CD enforcement, **When** code is pushed to repository, **Then** automated checks should enforce test passing and coverage requirements

### Edge Cases
- What happens when legacy code cannot be easily tested?
- How does system handle breaking API changes that would affect external consumers?
- Tests require IRIS database in Docker - what happens if Docker is unavailable or database fails to start?
- How to handle performance regression when adding comprehensive test coverage?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST fix all 105 currently failing tests to achieve 100% test pass rate
- **FR-002**: System MUST achieve minimum 60% overall code coverage across the codebase
- **FR-003**: Critical modules (config, validation, pipelines, services, storage) MUST each achieve minimum 80% code coverage
- **FR-004**: System MUST establish automated CI/CD pipeline that blocks merges when tests fail or coverage drops below thresholds
- **FR-005**: System MUST align test expectations with actual implementation behaviors (fix AttributeError and mock configuration issues)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear test setup documentation including Docker setup, Python dependencies, and environment variables
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain backwards compatibility for top-level pipeline factory APIs (create_pipeline, etc.)
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate coverage reports in commonly used CI formats (JSON, JUnit XML, and HTML)
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle test data and fixtures using actual IRIS database instance running in Docker containers
- **FR-010**: System MUST establish performance benchmarks to prevent regression with maximum 2x increase in test execution time

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Suite**: Collection of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests with pass/fail status tracking
- **Coverage Metrics**: Line coverage, branch coverage, and function coverage data per module
- **API Contract**: Defined interfaces between modules with versioning and compatibility tracking
- **Quality Gates**: Automated checks for test passing, coverage thresholds, and code quality standards

## Additional Context

### Current State Summary
- **Test Health**: 349 total tests, 105 failing (30% failure rate)
- **Coverage**: 9% overall, critical modules at 8-12% (vs 80% target)
- **Technical Debt**: 11,587 lines uncovered out of 12,775 total
- **Quality Issues**: API drift, incomplete implementations, poor test maintenance

### Business Impact
- **Risk**: Cannot confidently deploy to production with 30% test failure rate
- **Maintenance**: High cost of fixing bugs without test coverage
- **Velocity**: Development slowed by fear of breaking untested code
- **Trust**: Low confidence in framework stability for enterprise use

### Success Metrics
- 100% test pass rate (from current 70%)
- 60%+ overall coverage (from current 9%)
- 80%+ coverage on all critical modules
- Zero test failures in CI/CD pipeline
- Documented test patterns for future development
