## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
RAG application developers and researchers need access to state-of-the-art dense retrieval capabilities that provide superior document ranking and relevance through advanced neural retrieval models. The system must deliver measurably better retrieval quality compared to traditional vector similarity search while maintaining reasonable performance and providing graceful fallbacks when advanced components are unavailable.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a corpus of documents loaded into the system, **When** users submit queries requiring high-precision retrieval, **Then** the ColBERT pipeline uses late interaction mechanisms to provide superior document ranking and relevance compared to standard vector search methods
2. **Given** initial document candidates from vector search, **When** the PyLate reranking system processes them, **Then** the system applies native ColBERT reranking to improve the final ranking quality using configurable rerank factors and batch processing
3. **Given** PyLate dependencies are unavailable or fail, **When** the system initializes, **Then** the system gracefully falls back to standard vector retrieval with clear status reporting and no service interruption
4. **Given** varying query complexity and document collections, **When** users execute multiple queries, **Then** the system maintains consistent performance with configurable embedding caching and optimized batch processing for efficiency

### Edge Cases
- What happens when PyLate dependencies are partially available but model loading fails? ‚Üí System fails initialization completely and requires manual dependency resolution to ensure consistent operational state
- How does the system handle very long documents that exceed ColBERT's maximum token limits? ‚Üí System processes documents without token limits, handling segmentation automatically as needed
- What occurs when reranking operations encounter memory limitations during batch processing? ‚Üí System fails the operation with clear memory limit error messages and guidance for resolution
- How does the system manage performance when processing large candidate sets for reranking? ‚Üí System limits candidate set size with configurable maximum thresholds

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide advanced dense retrieval using ColBERT late interaction mechanisms for superior document ranking and relevance beyond traditional vector similarity search
- **FR-002**: System MUST support PyLate integration with native reranking capabilities using configurable model selection and batch processing parameters
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement two-stage retrieval with initial vector search followed by ColBERT reranking using configurable rerank factors with a balanced default of top 25% candidates to balance quality and performance
- **FR-004**: System MUST fail initialization completely when PyLate dependencies are partially available but model loading fails, requiring manual dependency resolution, while providing graceful fallback to standard vector retrieval only when dependencies are completely unavailable
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain consistent configuration patterns with existing RAG pipelines while extending functionality through ColBERT-specific parameters and optimization settings
- **FR-006**: System MUST support embedding caching and batch processing optimizations with explicit memory limit error handling to improve performance for repeated queries and large document collections
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle document preprocessing without token limits, implementing automatic segmentation as needed while preserving content integrity and retrieval effectiveness
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide comprehensive performance monitoring including reranking operation counts, embedding cache efficiency, and retrieval quality metrics
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with existing vector stores and answer generation systems while providing enhanced retrieval capabilities
- **FR-010**: System MUST support configurable model selection allowing different ColBERT variants and PyLate model configurations for different use cases and performance requirements
