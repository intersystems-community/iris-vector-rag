## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Enterprise RAG application operators need comprehensive performance optimization capabilities that automatically tune vector search parameters, manage caching strategies, optimize database connections, and provide real-time monitoring to achieve consistent sub-200ms response times at scale while handling 10,000+ queries per second with minimal manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** high-volume RAG queries with varying vector dimensions, **When** the HNSW tuner analyzes performance patterns, **Then** optimal index parameters are automatically applied to achieve target response times without manual configuration
2. **Given** repeated similarity search patterns, **When** the cache manager processes queries, **Then** frequently accessed results are cached with appropriate TTL policies reducing database load and improving response times
3. **Given** concurrent database operations under load, **When** the connection pool manages database access, **Then** connections are efficiently distributed and reused maintaining consistent performance without connection exhaustion
4. **Given** performance degradation or threshold violations, **When** the monitoring system detects issues, **Then** automated alerts are generated with specific recommendations and performance dashboards provide actionable insights

### Edge Cases
- What happens when cache memory limits are exceeded during peak usage periods? ‚Üí System implements graceful degradation by evicting least-recently-used cache entries and reducing cache hit rates while maintaining core functionality
- How does the system handle connection pool exhaustion during traffic spikes? ‚Üí System gracefully degrades by implementing request queuing with timeout limits and reducing concurrent operations while maintaining essential database access
- What occurs when HNSW parameter optimization conflicts with memory constraints? ‚Üí System prioritizes memory stability over optimization, reverting to safe parameter values while logging optimization conflicts for administrative review
- How does monitoring perform during system failures or database connectivity issues? ‚Üí Monitoring system maintains local metric collection and buffering capabilities with offline mode operation until connectivity is restored

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide automated HNSW index parameter tuning to optimize vector search performance for different embedding dimensions and query patterns
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement multi-layer caching with configurable TTL policies for query results, entity extractions, and graph traversal paths
- **FR-003**: System MUST manage database connection pooling with automatic scaling and performance metrics to handle concurrent operations efficiently
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide comprehensive performance monitoring with real-time dashboards (1-5 second refresh rates), leveraging IRIS native OpenTelemetry integration (IRIS 2025.2+) for OTLP/HTTP export to observability platforms or fallback to /api/monitor metrics polling for IRIS 2025.1, and historical trend analysis
- **FR-005**: System MUST achieve target performance metrics of sub-200ms vector search query response times (excluding LLM generation) and support best-effort throughput based on standard IRIS SQL response capacity under normal operating conditions
- **FR-006**: System MUST support automated database query optimization including intelligent index creation and materialized view management
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide parallel processing capabilities for batch operations with configurable concurrency limits and progress tracking
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement cache invalidation strategies and memory management to prevent resource exhaustion and maintain data consistency
- **FR-009**: System MUST support performance threshold monitoring with automated telemetry export using IRIS native OpenTelemetry via OTLP/HTTP (IRIS 2025.2+) or structured logging with /api/monitor polling (IRIS 2025.1) for critical metrics and performance degradation detection
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide optimization analytics and recommendations for system administrators to make informed performance tuning decisions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **HNSWIndexTuner**: Automated tuning system for vector index parameters including M values, efConstruction, and ef settings based on workload analysis
- **CacheManager**: Multi-layer caching system with LRU policies, TTL management, and thread-safe operations for different data types
- **ConnectionPoolManager**: Database connection lifecycle management with performance metrics, automatic scaling, and health monitoring
- **PerformanceMonitor**: Real-time monitoring dashboard with metric collection, alert generation, and performance trend analysis
- **DatabaseOptimizer**: Automated database optimization including index creation, query analysis, and materialized view management
- **ParallelProcessor**: Concurrent operation management with configurable threading, progress tracking, and resource utilization control

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-28
