# Data Management Pipeline Specification

## Overview
The RAG Templates Data Management Pipeline provides comprehensive document ingestion, processing, chunking, embedding generation, and storage capabilities that serve as the foundation for all RAG operations. The pipeline handles multi-format document processing, intelligent chunking strategies, embedding generation with multiple models, and optimized storage in the IRIS vector database.

## Primary User Story
Data engineers, RAG system administrators, and application developers need a robust, scalable data pipeline that can ingest documents from various sources, process them intelligently, generate high-quality embeddings, and store them efficiently for retrieval operations. The pipeline must handle enterprise-scale data volumes while maintaining data quality, performance, and operational reliability.
