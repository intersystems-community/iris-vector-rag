- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Enterprise RAG application users and graph database administrators need a high-performance, production-ready hybrid search system that combines vector similarity, text matching, and knowledge graph traversal while ensuring complete data integrity through explicit node identity management. The system must deliver dramatic performance improvements (50x faster) while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability and preventing data corruption through referential integrity constraints.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a complex multi-modal query requiring vector similarity and graph traversal, **When** the user executes the query through the synthesized HybridGraphRAG pipeline, **Then** the system combines vector embeddings, text matching, and graph relationships using advanced fusion algorithms to deliver superior result quality in under 50 milliseconds with demonstrable 50x performance improvement over baseline implementations

2. **Given** existing graph data without explicit node identity, **When** the administrator migrates to NodePK-enabled HybridGraphRAG system, **Then** the system discovers all node identifiers, establishes referential integrity constraints, and validates data consistency without data loss while enabling performance optimizations

3. **Given** concurrent users performing hybrid searches with NodePK constraints active, **When** multiple operations attempt to create or reference nodes, **Then** the system enforces referential integrity preventing orphaned references and ensuring data consistency while maintaining sub-100 millisecond response times

4. **Given** enterprise production environments with large knowledge graphs, **When** users execute hybrid queries leveraging both iris-vector-graph optimizations and RAG-templates pipeline infrastructure, **Then** the system delivers consistent performance, comprehensive error handling, and detailed observability without silent failures or data corruption

### Edge Cases

- What happens when iris-vector-graph NodePK constraints conflict with existing RAG data during migration? ‚Üí System performs comprehensive data validation and reports all conflicts before applying constraints, requiring manual resolution for any inconsistencies
- How does the system handle performance degradation when fusion algorithms encounter very large result sets from multiple modalities? ‚Üí System applies configurable result set limits and adaptive fusion strategies to maintain response time targets while preserving result quality
- What occurs when NodePK referential integrity constraints are violated during bulk data operations? ‚Üí System halts operations immediately, provides detailed violation reports with specific node identifiers, and offers repair utilities for orphaned references
- How does the system manage memory and connection resources during high-concurrency hybrid operations with NodePK validation overhead? ‚Üí System implements intelligent connection pooling, memory-bounded caching, and adaptive constraint checking to maintain performance under concurrent load

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST synthesize existing HybridGraphRAG pipeline capabilities with iris-vector-graph NodePK explicit node identity to create a unified high-performance multi-modal retrieval system

- **FR-002**: System MUST implement NodePK-aware hybrid search combining vector similarity, text matching, and graph traversal with referential integrity validation while achieving measurable 50x performance improvements over baseline implementations

- **FR-003**: System MUST enforce referential integrity through NodePK constraints ensuring every edge, label, property, and embedding references valid nodes while maintaining sub-100 millisecond query response times for hybrid operations

- **FR-004**: System MUST provide seamless migration capabilities from existing HybridGraphRAG implementations to NodePK-enabled versions without data loss, including comprehensive validation and conflict resolution procedures

- **FR-005**: System MUST support advanced fusion algorithms (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) that leverage NodePK optimization for improved join performance and cardinality estimation in multi-modal query execution

- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing RAG pipeline interfaces while extending capabilities through NodePK-enhanced performance optimizations and integrity guarantees

- **FR-007**: System MUST provide comprehensive performance monitoring and benchmarking capabilities to measure and validate the 50x performance improvements across vector, text, and graph search modalities
