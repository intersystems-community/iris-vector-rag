# Feature Specification: Pipeline Capability Declaration and Resolution System

**Feature Branch**: `002-how-pipelines-declare`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "how pipelines declare their capabilities and this gets resolved into SQL schema and vector embeddings configurations. This is already designed, but I want it formalized better!"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
RAG framework developers need a standardized system for pipelines to declare their data requirements (tables, embeddings, indexes) and have those requirements automatically resolved into correct SQL schemas and vector embedding configurations. This enables seamless pipeline deployment without manual schema management and ensures consistency across different pipeline types.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new pipeline type is defined, **When** the pipeline declares its requirements, **Then** the system automatically generates the correct database schema with all required tables and vector columns
2. **Given** a pipeline requires specific embedding dimensions, **When** the requirements are processed, **Then** vector columns are created with the correct dimensions and HNSW indexes are configured appropriately
3. **Given** multiple pipelines have overlapping table requirements, **When** both pipelines are deployed, **Then** the system resolves conflicts and creates a unified schema that satisfies all requirements
4. **Given** a pipeline declares optional tables, **When** the pipeline is deployed with minimal configuration, **Then** only required tables are created while optional tables remain available for later activation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when two pipelines require the same table with different vector dimensions?
- How does the system handle pipeline requirements that conflict with existing schema?
- What occurs when a pipeline declares requirements for tables that don't exist in the registry?
- How does the system resolve dependencies between required and optional tables?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Pipelines MUST declare their data requirements through a standardized interface specifying tables, embeddings, and constraints
- **FR-002**: System MUST resolve pipeline requirements into concrete SQL DDL statements for table creation and modification
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically determine vector column dimensions based on pipeline embedding model requirements
- **FR-004**: System MUST create appropriate HNSW vector indexes for all declared vector columns with optimization settings
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle requirement conflicts by failing fast with detailed conflict reports that provide step-by-step migration instructions to new versioned tables
- **FR-006**: System MUST support both required and optional table/embedding declarations with different validation rules
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that all declared requirements are satisfiable before attempting schema modifications
- **FR-008**: System MUST track which pipelines contributed to each table/column to enable safe schema evolution
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a registry system for pipeline requirement discovery and validation
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with configuration management to resolve embedding models to specific vector dimensions

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Requirement resolution SHOULD complete with best-effort performance using timeout warnings rather than hard performance guarantees
- **NFR-002**: System MUST provide timeout warnings when resolution exceeds expected processing time
- **NFR-003**: System MUST handle complex scenarios gracefully without strict performance SLAs

### Dependency Management
- **FR-011**: Pipelines MUST explicitly declare dependencies on tables from other pipelines
- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce deployment order based on declared pipeline dependencies
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate dependency chains before allowing pipeline deployment

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **PipelineRequirements**: Abstract declaration of data needs including tables, embeddings, and constraints for a specific pipeline type
- **TableRequirement**: Specification for a database table including schema, columns, constraints, and performance characteristics
- **EmbeddingRequirement**: Declaration of vector embedding needs including table, column, model, and dimension requirements
- **RequirementResolver**: Component that transforms abstract requirements into concrete schema configurations
- **SchemaConflictDetector**: System that identifies and reports conflicts between pipeline requirements
- **RequirementRegistry**: Central registry for discovering and validating pipeline capability declarations
- **DependencyResolver**: Component that manages pipeline dependencies and enforces deployment ordering
- **ConflictReporter**: System that generates detailed conflict reports with step-by-step migration instructions

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: What should happen when pipeline requirements conflict with existing production data? ‚Üí A: Fail fast with detailed conflict report providing step-by-step migration instructions to new versioned tables
- Q: What are the performance requirements for requirement resolution processing? ‚Üí A: Best-effort with timeout warnings, no hard performance guarantees
- Q: How should the system handle pipeline requirements that depend on tables from other pipelines? ‚Üí A: Explicitly declare dependencies and enforce deployment order
