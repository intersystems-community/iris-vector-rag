## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Data scientists, RAG system developers, and knowledge workers need interactive visualization capabilities to explore knowledge graphs, understand entity relationships, debug retrieval paths, and gain insights into the structure and quality of extracted knowledge. The system must provide intuitive visual interfaces that make complex knowledge relationships accessible and actionable for both technical analysis and business understanding.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a completed GraphRAG query with entity relationships, **When** users request knowledge graph visualization, **Then** the system generates interactive visual representations showing entities, relationships, traversal paths, and metadata with color-coded types and configurable layouts
2. **Given** seed entities and traversal results from knowledge graph queries, **When** users explore the visualization, **Then** the system highlights query paths, shows relationship strengths, and provides detailed hover information for entities and connections with performance timing insights
3. **Given** complex knowledge graphs with many entities and relationships, **When** users need to export or share visualizations, **Then** the system supports multiple output formats including interactive HTML, static images, and standard graph formats compatible with external analysis tools
4. **Given** different user preferences and analysis requirements, **When** users interact with visualizations, **Then** the system provides multiple visualization modes including force-directed layouts, hierarchical views, and custom styling options with responsive design for different screen sizes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when knowledge graphs are too large to visualize effectively in a single view? ‚Üí System uses multi-level zoom with detail-on-demand through standard graph visualization packages
- How does the system handle visualization performance when dealing with thousands of entities and relationships? ‚Üí System uses automatic downsampling based on entity importance and relationship strength
- What occurs when external visualization dependencies are unavailable or fail to load? ‚Üí System fails completely with clear error message and dependency installation guidance
- How does the system manage interactive features when running in environments without full browser support? ‚Üí System fails with browser compatibility error and minimum requirements guidance

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate interactive knowledge graph visualizations from GraphRAG query results showing entities, relationships, and traversal paths with color-coded entity types and relationship strengths
- **FR-002**: System MUST support multiple visualization modes including force-directed layouts, hierarchical arrangements, and circular designs with configurable node sizes, edge weights, and color schemes
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide detailed entity and relationship information through hover interactions, click events, and expandable information panels showing metadata, confidence scores, and source documents
- **FR-004**: System MUST highlight query-specific elements including seed entities, traversal paths, and related documents with visual distinction and interactive exploration capabilities
- **FR-005**: System MUST export visualizations in multiple formats including interactive HTML, static images, GraphML for external tools, and JSON data structures for further analysis
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate performance timing information showing query execution steps, database operations, and processing bottlenecks through visual timeline representations and detailed metadata displays
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle large knowledge graphs through multi-level zoom with detail-on-demand using standard graph visualization packages, automatic downsampling based on entity importance and relationship strength with a maximum of 1000 nodes displayed simultaneously, progressive loading, filtering capabilities, and zoom/pan interactions while maintaining responsive performance and visual clarity
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide debugging capabilities for RAG pipeline development including entity extraction validation, relationship quality assessment, and retrieval path analysis with visual feedback
- **FR-009**: System MUST support customizable styling and branding options including color themes, layout preferences, and institutional styling requirements for different deployment contexts
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure accessibility and usability across different devices and browsers with responsive design, keyboard navigation, and alternative text descriptions for visual elements
- **FR-011**: System MUST fail explicitly with clear error messages and dependency installation guidance when external visualization dependencies are unavailable or fail to load
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate browser compatibility and fail with clear error messages and minimum requirements guidance when running in environments without full browser support

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **GraphVisualizer**: Core visualization engine generating interactive knowledge graph representations from GraphRAG query results with configurable layouts and styling options
- **VisualizationRenderer**: Multi-format rendering system supporting interactive HTML, static exports, and external tool compatibility with performance optimization and responsive design
- **EntityDisplayManager**: Component managing visual representation of entities including type-based coloring, size scaling, metadata presentation, and interactive behavior configuration
- **RelationshipPathHighlighter**: System component highlighting query traversal paths, relationship strengths, and connection patterns with visual emphasis and interactive exploration features
- **PerformanceTimingVisualizer**: Specialized visualization component displaying query execution timelines, processing bottlenecks, and performance metrics with drill-down capabilities for debugging
- **ExportManager**: Multi-format export system supporting GraphML, JSON, PNG, SVG, and interactive HTML formats with configurable quality settings and metadata preservation
