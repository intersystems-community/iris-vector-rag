# Feature Specification: Fix RAGAS GraphRAG Evaluation Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `040-fix-ragas-evaluation`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Fix RAGAS evaluation workflow to properly test GraphRAG pipeline by loading documents with entity extraction before evaluation. Currently GraphRAG pipeline fails with 'Knowledge graph is empty' because the load-data script only loads basic documents without extracting entities. The RAGAS evaluation should detect when testing GraphRAG and either: (1) load documents using GraphRAG's load_documents() method to extract entities, or (2) skip GraphRAG evaluation with a clear message if entity data is not available."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input ✓
   → Identified: RAGAS evaluation workflow, GraphRAG pipeline, entity extraction requirement
2. Extract key concepts from description ✓
   → Actors: RAGAS evaluation system, GraphRAG pipeline
   → Actions: load documents, extract entities, evaluate pipeline, skip evaluation
   → Data: documents, entities, relationships, knowledge graph
   → Constraints: GraphRAG requires populated knowledge graph
3. For each unclear aspect: ✓
   → All aspects clearly specified in user description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ✓
   → Primary scenario: Run RAGAS evaluation with GraphRAG included
5. Generate Functional Requirements ✓
   → 6 testable requirements extracted
6. Identify Key Entities ✓
   → Knowledge graph entities, entity relationships, evaluation results
7. Run Review Checklist ✓
   → No implementation details, focused on evaluation behavior
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Problem Statement

**Current Behavior**: RAGAS evaluation workflow fails when testing GraphRAG pipeline with error "Knowledge graph is empty" because the standard data loading process does not extract entities from documents.

**Root Cause**: The evaluation workflow assumes all pipelines can work with the same pre-loaded document data, but GraphRAG requires a populated knowledge graph (entities and relationships) which is not created by basic document loading.

**Business Impact**:
- GraphRAG pipeline cannot be evaluated using RAGAS metrics
- Quality assessment incomplete for knowledge graph-based retrieval
- Pipeline comparison metrics are invalid (GraphRAG shows 0% success rate)

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a RAG system developer, I need to run RAGAS evaluation across all available pipelines including GraphRAG, so that I can compare retrieval quality metrics and validate that knowledge graph-based retrieval is working correctly.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** RAGAS evaluation is configured to test GraphRAG pipeline, **When** the evaluation runs and knowledge graph data exists, **Then** GraphRAG evaluation completes successfully and returns quality metrics (faithfulness, context precision, etc.)

2. **Given** RAGAS evaluation is configured to test GraphRAG pipeline, **When** the evaluation runs and no knowledge graph data exists, **Then** the system either:
   - Option A: Automatically loads documents with entity extraction to populate the knowledge graph, then evaluates
   - Option B: Skips GraphRAG evaluation with a clear informational message explaining that entity data is required

3. **Given** RAGAS evaluation includes both basic and GraphRAG pipelines, **When** the evaluation completes, **Then** both pipeline types produce valid quality metrics that can be compared

4. **Given** documents are loaded for GraphRAG evaluation, **When** entity extraction is performed, **Then** the knowledge graph tables (Entities, EntityRelationships) are populated with extracted data

5. **Given** a RAGAS evaluation run has completed, **When** reviewing results, **Then** the evaluation report clearly indicates which pipelines were tested and which were skipped (if any)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when entity extraction fails for all documents (no extractable entities)?
  - System should report zero entities extracted but not crash

- How does system handle partial entity extraction (some documents succeed, some fail)?
  - System should continue evaluation with available entity data

- What happens when knowledge graph has data but insufficient entities for meaningful evaluation?
  - System should complete evaluation with available data and report entity count in results

- How does system handle documents already loaded but without entities?
  - System should detect missing entity data and re-process documents with entity extraction

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Evaluation workflow MUST detect when GraphRAG pipeline is included in the test configuration

- **FR-002**: Evaluation workflow MUST check whether knowledge graph tables (Entities, EntityRelationships) contain sufficient data before attempting GraphRAG evaluation

- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a configurable behavior for handling missing entity data:
  - Auto-load mode: Automatically load documents with entity extraction
  - Skip mode: Skip GraphRAG evaluation and log clear informational message
  - Fail mode: Fail evaluation with descriptive error

- **FR-004**: When auto-loading documents for GraphRAG, system MUST use GraphRAG pipeline's document loading method to ensure entity extraction occurs

- **FR-005**: Evaluation results MUST clearly indicate which pipelines were successfully evaluated and which were skipped or failed

- **FR-006**: When GraphRAG evaluation is skipped due to missing entity data, the skip reason MUST be logged with sufficient detail for users to understand how to fix the issue

### Key Entities

- **Knowledge Graph Entity**: Extracted concepts, terms, or named entities from documents with unique identifiers and types
- **Entity Relationship**: Connections between entities representing semantic relationships found in document content
- **Evaluation Result**: RAGAS quality metrics (faithfulness, context precision, recall, relevancy) for each tested pipeline
- **Pipeline Configuration**: Settings specifying which pipelines to test and how to handle missing prerequisites
