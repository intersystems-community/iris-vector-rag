**Feature Branch**: `022-more-testing-fixing`
**Created**: October 2, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "more testing, fixing all the tests"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identify need for comprehensive test improvements
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, CI/CD systems, test runners
   ‚Üí Actions: fix failing tests, add missing tests, improve coverage
   ‚Üí Data: test results, coverage metrics, test configurations
   ‚Üí Constraints: maintain existing functionality, improve reliability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific coverage targets and test types priority]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear development workflow scenarios identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements focused on test suite quality and functionality
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Test suites, test cases, coverage reports, CI pipelines
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and focused on developer/system needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT the test suite needs to accomplish and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement specific testing frameworks or architectures
- üë• Written for development team and stakeholders who need reliable testing

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the RAG templates framework, I need a comprehensive and reliable test suite so that I can confidently develop features, catch regressions early, and maintain high code quality across all components.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer makes code changes, **When** they run the test suite, **Then** all tests execute successfully without configuration errors
2. **Given** a CI/CD pipeline runs tests, **When** tests complete, **Then** coverage reports show meaningful metrics across all critical components
3. **Given** a developer adds new functionality, **When** they check test coverage, **Then** they can identify which areas need additional test coverage
4. **Given** async components exist in the codebase, **When** async tests run, **Then** they execute properly without fixture or configuration issues
5. **Given** integration tests run, **When** external dependencies are unavailable, **Then** tests gracefully handle failures with clear error messages

### Edge Cases
- What happens when async fixtures encounter event loop conflicts?
- How does the system handle missing test dependencies or configuration issues?
- What occurs when tests run in different environments (local vs CI)?
- How are test failures distinguished between real bugs vs infrastructure issues?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Test suite MUST execute all unit tests without async configuration failures
- **FR-002**: Test suite MUST provide meaningful code coverage metrics for all core modules
- **FR-003**: Developers MUST be able to run tests locally with consistent results
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle async test fixtures properly across all test scenarios
- **FR-005**: Test suite MUST differentiate between infrastructure failures and actual code defects
- **FR-006**: Integration tests MUST gracefully handle missing external dependencies
- **FR-007**: Test configuration MUST be consistent across development and CI environments
- **FR-008**: Test suite MUST provide clear failure messages that help identify root causes
- **FR-009**: Coverage reports MUST identify specific uncovered code paths for improvement
- **FR-010**: Test suite MUST validate critical RAG pipeline functionality end-to-end
- **FR-011**: System MUST support parallel test execution without conflicts
- **FR-012**: Test suite MUST include comprehensive mocking for external dependencies

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Full test suite MUST complete within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable time limit for CI/CD pipelines - 5 minutes? 15 minutes?]
- **PR-002**: Individual unit tests MUST execute within reasonable time bounds
- **PR-003**: Coverage analysis MUST complete without significantly impacting test runtime

### Quality Requirements
- **QR-001**: Test suite MUST achieve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target coverage percentage - 60%? 80%?] overall code coverage
- **QR-002**: Critical path components MUST have [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum coverage for core modules - 80%? 90%?] test coverage
- **QR-003**: All tests MUST be deterministic and produce consistent results
- **QR-004**: Test failures MUST provide actionable debugging information

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Suite**: Collection of all automated tests covering unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios
- **Coverage Report**: Detailed analysis showing which code paths are tested and which need attention
- **Test Configuration**: Settings and fixtures that ensure consistent test execution across environments
- **Mock Objects**: Simulated dependencies that allow testing without external system requirements
- **Async Fixtures**: Special test setup components for testing asynchronous functionality
- **CI Pipeline**: Automated testing workflow that validates code changes before integration
