      "content": "Physiology and Pharmacology of Effects of GLP-1-based Therapies on Gastric, Biliary and Intestinal Motility\n\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1- and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist tirzepatide (referred to here collectively as �GLP-1-based therapy�) are incretin-based therapies being used increasingly in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity. They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease. In this review, we summarize the effects of GLP-1 and incretin-based therapeutics on gastric, biliary and small intestinal function. An improved understanding of these effects will optimize the use of these drugs.\n\nAuthors: Ryan J Jalleh, Chinmay S Marathe, Christopher K Rayner, Karen L Jones, Mahesh M Umapathysivam, Tongzhi Wu, Daniel R Quast, Mark P Plummer, Michael A Nauck, Michael Horowitz\n\nKeywords: biliary, gastric emptying, glucagon-like peptide-1, hypoglycemia, physiology, small intestinal motility",

This study included 88 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who underwent\nroutine eye examinations. Three groups were created. Group 1 consisted of\npatients without diabetic retinopathy. Group 2 included patients with\nnon-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Group 3 included patients with\nproliferative diabetic retinopathy. To measure serum HIF-1� and\nsurvivin levels, venous blood samples were collected from patients. The mean HIF-1� levels in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 17.30 � 2.19,\n17.79 � 2.34, and 14.19 � 2.94 pg/ml, respectively.\nSignificant differences were detected between groups 1 and 3 (p=0.01) and\nbetween groups 2 and 3 (p=0.01).

This study included 33 patients with periodontitis. Eleven of them were type 1 diabetes patients, 11 were type 2 diabetes patients, and 11 were non-diabetics. At baseline and 3 months after the FMD, the periodontal parameters of each patient were recorded, samples of capillary blood for the chairside assessment of HbA1c were taken, and plaque samples from the two deepest periodontal pockets were collected to test for the presence of  Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans Porphyromonas gingivalis Prevotella intermedia Tannerella forsythia Treponema denticola Bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) decreased statistically significantly (p < 0.05) in all three groups 3 months after FMD. Only the proportion of Pg in the control group decreased statistically significantly (p < 0.05), while the proportion of other bacteria decreased or remained the same, whereby the differences were not statistically significant. Moreover, the proportion of Aa in type 1 diabetics increased statistically significantly (p < 0.05).

      "content": "Carbon dots: synthesis, sensing mechanisms, and potential applications as promising materials for glucose sensors\n\nThe disruption of glucose (Glu) metabolism in the human body can lead to conditions such as diabetes and hyperglycemia. Therefore, accurately determining Glu levels is crucial for clinical diagnosis and other applications. Carbon dots (CDs) are a novel category of carbon nanomaterials that exhibit outstanding optical properties, excellent biocompatibility, high water solubility, low production costs, and straightforward synthesis. Recently, researchers have developed various carbon dot sensors for fast and real-time Glu monitoring. In this context, we provide a comprehensive introduction to Glu and CDs for the first time. We categorize the synthetic methods for CDs and the sensing mechanisms, further classifying the applications of carbon dot probes into single-probe sensing, ratiometric sensing, and visual detection. Finally, we discuss the future development needs for CD-based Glu sensors. This review aims to offer insights into advancing Glu sensors and modern medical treatments.\n\nAuthors: Kawan F.

We examined changes in 1,5 anhydroglucitol (1,5AG) levels during gestation and PP and assessed for associations with other measures of glycemia. Pregnant participants (n = 50) in the Study of Pregnancy Regulation of Insulin and Glucose cohort underwent OGTTs at a mean of 13 weeks ([visit 1 (V1)] and 26 weeks [visit 2 (V2)] of gestation and PP. Nonpregnant controls had a single OGTT. 1,5AG was measured using frozen plasma samples. Changes in 1,5AG across pregnancy were assessed with longitudinal mixed effects linear models. We assessed relationships between 1,5AG and glycemia at each timepoint using Spearman correlations and linear regression models. To determine the relationship of 1,5AG with breastfeeding (BF) status, stratified analyses were performed. 1,5AG decreased from V1 to V2 (� = �3.6��g/mL,  P P P P P P P 1,5AG decreases during gestation and remains low PP. Breastfeeding is associated with lower 1,5AG levels, indicating plausible excretion into breastmilk. 1,5AG is unlikely to be useful in assessing glycemia in pregnant or PP women.\n\nAuthors: Marti D Soffer, Kaitlyn E James, Michael Callahan, Emily A Rosenberg, William H Barth, Camille E Powe\n\nKeywords: gestational diabetes, gestational glycemia, postpartum screening, postpartum diabetes, 1,5 anhydroglucitol, pregnancy biomarkers, breastfeeding",
