  "query": "How does COVID-19 affect the respiratory system?",
  "answer": "COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system by causing inflammation in the lungs and airways, leading to symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, and in severe cases, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It can also lead to a condition known as 'cytokine storm' where the body's immune system overreacts and causes damage to the lungs.",
