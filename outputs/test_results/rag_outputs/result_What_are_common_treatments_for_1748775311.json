Participants ( N 1c BMI was associated with 10% higher odds of prediabetes/T2DM vs. having normal HbA 1c The unstable associations between BMI and T2DM across race indicate that BMI has received unwarranted focus as a prime predictor of T2DM. Relying on BMI introduces bias in T2DM risk estimations especially in Black individuals. Focusing on BMI places the onus on individuals to change and increases weight stigma, which can worsen health outcomes. Instead, policymakers should focus on social determinants of T2DM and its concomitant racial/ethnic disparities.\\n\\nAuthors: S. Strings, C. Wells, C. Bell, A.J.

Whether Irisin has a potential protective role in traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, we will investigate the relevant research progress of Irisin\ufffds protective role in traumatic brain injury (TBI) in recent years in terms of attenuating oxidative stress, inhibiting pyroptosis, suppressing inflammatory response, and improving autophagy, with the aim of providing valuable references for the diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Utilize bioinformatics analysis to study the interactions between genes in TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury). Construct a TBI mouse model to observe the effects of Irisin on TBI. The Morris water maze test is used to assess the learning and spatial memory abilities of mice, TUNEL fluorescence is used to detect cell apoptosis, Nissl staining is employed to observe the survival of hippocampal neurons in mice, and HE staining is used to observe the extent of brain injury in mice. Western blot is used to detect protein expression in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Q-PCR is employed to detect the levels of proteins related to autophagy/pyroptosis/inflammation. Irisin promotes MerTK overexpression by enhancing AMPK activation. Irisin can increase the expression of LC3I and Beclin-1 proteins, indicating the promotion of autophagic response. Additionally, Irisin reduces ROS levels and decreases SYK expression, thereby inhibiting the inflammatory response. Irisin improves the learning and spatial memory abilities of TBI mice and reduces cell apoptosis, as well as decreases hippocampal neuron death. HE staining shows that the brain injury in mice treated with Irisin is significantly alleviated. Irisin can enhance the expression of phosphorylated AMPK and phosphorylated MerTK proteins, promote autophagic response, and inhibit pyroptosis/inflammatory response. Correction experiments confirmed that after stimulation with an AMPK agonist, the expression of phosphorylated MerTK protein is significantly increased, autophagic response is enhanced, and pyroptosis/inflammatory response is weakened. When treated with a MerTK inhibitor during AMPK agonist stimulation, the autophagic response is weakened while pyroptosis/inflammatory response is enhanced. Irisin can inhibit the progression of traumatic brain injury by regulating AMPK/MerTK/autophagy and SYK/ROS/inflammatory signaling.

Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.\\n\\nAuthors: Chun-Yao Cheng, Wen-Rui Hao, Tzu-Hurng Cheng\\n\\nKeywords: Bivalirudin, Acute coronary syndrome, Myocardial microcirculation, Elderly patients, Anticoagulation', 'score': np.float32(0.61579)}"

This multicenter cohort study included demographic and clinical data from 446 NMOSD patients collected from 35 German Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS) centers. Time to disability milestones was estimated through Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for sex, year of onset, immunotherapy exposure and antibody status. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to compare attack outcomes. Of the 446 NMOSD patients analyzed (83.4% female, 85.4% AQP4-IgG-positive, median age at disease onset = 43 years), 153 had a late-onset (34.3%). AQP4-IgG+ prevalence was higher in LO- than in EO-NMOSD (94.1% vs. 80.9%,  p p p p p p LO-NMOSD patients presented more often with myelitis, experienced worse attack outcomes and faster disability accumulation, despite comparable AAR, acute attack treatment and long-term treatment regimens. Accordingly, therapeutic strategies for attack and prophylactic treatment in LO-NMOSD have to be improved.\\n\\nAuthors: Julian Reza Kretschmer, Daria Tkachenko, Tania K\ufffdmpfel, Joachim Havla, Daniel Engels, Friedemann Paul, Patrick Schindler, Judith Bellmann-Strobl, Achim Berthele, Katrin Giglhuber, Clarissa Zappe, Luisa Klotz, Lisa Revie, Eva Dawin, Makbule Senel, Hayrettin Tumani, Florian Then Bergh, Clemens Warnke, Markus Kraemer, Annette Walter, Antonios Bayas, Uwe K.
