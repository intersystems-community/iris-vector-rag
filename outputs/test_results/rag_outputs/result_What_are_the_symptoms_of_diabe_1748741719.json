We report a case of severe hypercalcemia in a woman with uterine cancer who exhibited elevated PTH and PTHrP levels. Surgical intervention revealed dedifferentiated endometrial carcinoma. Postoperatively, PTH and PTHrP levels normalized but subsequently increased due to metastases. A molecular analysis confirmed the expression of the PTH gene and protein within the tumor, indicating ectopic PTH production. In diagnosing and treating cancers, it is necessary to consider not only PTHrP production but also ectopic PTH production.\\n\\nAuthors: Takeru Ogino, Hirofumi Watanabe, Shoko Yamazaki, Megumi Kurosawa, Akiko Kobayashi, Naofumi Imai, Takahiro Taguchi, Hajime Umezu, Ryo Aida, Kazuki Watanabe, Tadashi Otsuka, Hideyuki Kabasawa, Ryohei Kaseda, Suguru Yamamoto, Kosuke Yoshihara, Shin Goto, Ichiei Narita\\n\\nKeywords: parathyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, dedifferentiated endometrial carcinoma, hypercalcemia, ectopic expression', 'score': np.float32(0.12126267)}"

Noninvasive bullet characterization is of major importance for patients with lodged bullets or in mass disasters with multiple cadavers, which must be prioritized for autopsy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether brass and lead bullets can be differentiated using photon-counting CT (PCCT).

We investigated the health-promoting properties of low molecular weight duck blood protein hydrolysate (DBPH), fractionated by ultrafiltration with a 10\ufffdkDa molecular weight cut-off membrane, in flowerhorn fish. The analysis of molecular weight distribution revealed that the most common sizes of DBPH fell within the range of 3\ufffd7\ufffdkDa (39.68%), followed by >7\ufffd10\ufffdkDa (20.69%), 1\ufffd3\ufffdkDa (23.03%), and <1\ufffdkDa (9.00%). After 1 month of the feeding trial, fish fed with diets supplemented with 2% DBPH exhibited the highest growth, antioxidant activity, and humoral immune response enhancement under normal conditions. In addition, microbiome analysis confirmed that 2% DBPH possesses antimicrobial activity, as evidenced by the significant decrease in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and alpha diversity indexes, including Chao1 and Shannon. Compared to the control group, fish that were fed with diets supplemented with 2% DBPH exhibited a significantly higher abundance of the genera Cetobacterium and Romboutsia, which could serve as indicators of the overall health and well-being of the fish.

This multicenter cohort study included demographic and clinical data from 446 NMOSD patients collected from 35 German Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS) centers. Time to disability milestones was estimated through Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for sex, year of onset, immunotherapy exposure and antibody status. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to compare attack outcomes. Of the 446 NMOSD patients analyzed (83.4% female, 85.4% AQP4-IgG-positive, median age at disease onset = 43 years), 153 had a late-onset (34.3%).

Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.\\n\\nAuthors: Chun-Yao Cheng, Wen-Rui Hao, Tzu-Hurng Cheng\\n\\nKeywords: Bivalirudin, Acute coronary syndrome, Myocardial microcirculation, Elderly patients, Anticoagulation', 'score': np.float32(0.0937893)}"
