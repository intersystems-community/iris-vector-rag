Cigarette smoking is the single most important and modifiable risk factor with 5 to 20-fold susceptibility for periodontal diseases. Reverse smoking is a peculiar habit of smoking where the lit end is kept inside the mouth, which is predominant in the northern coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh. Polyamines are biologically active amines involved in tissue regeneration and modulation of inflammation. The study aimed to evaluate polyamines and check their utility as a marker in detection of periodontitis among different groups. Total polyamine levels showed significant increase in reverse smokers with periodontitis when compared to the other groups. Qualitative analysis by thin layer chromatography showed three polyamine bands with varying intensity among the different groups. Mass spectrometric and NMR analyses of the three bands identified them as N1, N8-diacetyl spermidine,  N N N The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00726-024-03396-4.\\n\\nAuthors: Md Haroon Rashid, Sandhya Pavan Kumar Yellarthi, Pavan Kumar Yellarthi, Brinda Goda Lakshmi Didugu, Anitha Mamillapalli\\n\\nKeywords: Periodontitis, Smokers, Reverse smokers, Polyamines, N1,N8-diacetyl spermidine', 'score': np.float64(0.11517930490517571)}"

Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.\\n\\nAuthors: Chunlei Yang, Zhiwen Jiang, Xinjie Gao, Heng Yang, Jiabin Su, Ruiyuan Weng, Wei Ni, Yuxiang Gu\\n\\nKeywords: Subarachnoid hemorrhage, Neuroprotection, Taurine, Astrocytes', 'score': np.float64(0.11033985589331867)}"

Among 2321 patients who started b/tsDMARDs between 2010 and 2023, we focused on 295 patients who had knee swelling or tenderness at the initiation of b/tsDMARDs and continued b/tsDMARDs at least 3 months, with recorded knee symptoms 6 months later. Symptom relief after 6 months was 78.2% for interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitors, 68.6% for Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, 65.8% for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and 57.6% for cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-Ig (CTLA4-Ig). The initial use of b/tsDMARDs and the use of IL-6 inhibitors in comparison to CTLA4-Ig emerged as a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms. Among 141 patients who underwent knee radiography at baseline and two years later, the deterioration in knee joint radiographs was 7.7% for IL-6 inhibitors, 6.3% for JAK inhibitors, 21.9% for TNF inhibitors, and 25.9% for CTLA4-Ig. The use of IL-6 inhibitors was a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms and the inhibition of joint destruction compared to CTLA4-Ig.\\n\\nAuthors: Koichi Murata, Ryuji Uozumi, Takayuki Fujii, Akira Onishi, Kosaku Murakami, Hideo Onizawa, Masao Tanaka, Akio Morinobu, Shuichi Matsuda\\n\\nKeywords: Rheumatoid arthritis, Knee arthritis, Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, CTLA4-Ig, IL-6', 'score': np.float64(0.11018689334920133)}"

The extracellular deposition of A\ufffd peptides in human AD brain causes neuronal death. Therefore, it has been found that A\ufffd peptide degradation is a possible therapeutic target for AD. CathD has been known to breakdown amyloid beta peptides. However, the structural role of CathD is not yet clear. Hence, for the purpose of gaining a deeper comprehension of the structure of CathD, the present computational investigation was performed using virtual screening technique to predict CathD's active site residues and substrate binding mode. Ligand-based virtual screening was implemented on small molecules from ZINC database against crystal structure of CathD. Further, molecular docking was utilised to investigate the binding mechanism of CathD with substrates and virtually screened inhibitors. Localised compounds obtained through screening performed by PyRx and AutoDock 4.2 with CathD receptor and the compounds having highest binding affinities were picked as; ZINC00601317, ZINC04214975 and ZINCC12500925 as our top choices.
