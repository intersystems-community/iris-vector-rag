  "answer": "Based on the provided information from the knowledge graph, COVID-19 primarily manifests as severe respiratory distress. The impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system is notable as well. It mentions that patients often suffer from certain vascular diseases, partly attributed to increased proliferation or altered phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the precise mechanism underlying SARSCoV2's influence on VSMC phenotype remains underreviewed. So, based on the information available, the specific details of how COVID-19 affects the respiratory system are not fully addressed.",

Screening in different databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Embase databases) was performed to identify relevant articles, focusing on the oral health of patients with COVID-19, and published up to November 2021. 5194 articles were identified, and 29 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Patients presenting more severe periodontal or dental diseases were at an increased risk of developing COVID-19 complications and being admitted to intensive care units. According to the included articles, U-shaped lingual papillitis and aphthous-like ulcers on the tongue are the most frequent lesions assessed in the oral cavity of COVID-19 patients, while xerostomia seems to be an early COVID-19 diagnostic symptom. Apart from the presence of the virus, the global lockdown had a detrimental impact on oral health. The occurrence of dental emergencies was augmented during this time due to the postponement of numerous non-emergency dental procedures. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in periodontal tissues and salivary fractions may explain the presence of oral lesions during the infection. However, the viruss direct or indirect effect on oral mucosa is unclear. It is important to consider that these manifestations might be attributed to underlying comorbidities, or co-existing or subsequent lesions produced by local irritants.\\n\\nAuthors: Maria Vilar Doceda, Marianna Gavriiloglou, Catherine Petit, Olivier Huck\\n\\nKeywords: COVID-19, oral health, oral manifestation, periodontal diseases, SARS-CoV-2', 'score': 1.0}"

Studies reveal that COVID19 patients often suffer from certain vascular diseases, partly attributed to increased proliferation or altered phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Although the association between COVID19 and VSMCs is recognized, the precise mechanism underlying SARSCoV2's influence on VSMC phenotype remains largely underreviewed. In this context, while there is a consistent body of literature dissecting the effect of COVID19 on the cardiovascular system, few reports delve into the potential role of VSMC switching in the pathophysiology associated with COVID19 and the molecular mechanisms involved therein. This review dissects and critiques the link between COVID19 and VSMCs, with particular attention to pathways involving cholesterol, calcium, and phosphate. These pathways underpin the interaction between the virus and VSMCs. Such interaction promotes VSMC proliferation, and eventually potentiates vascular calcification as well as worsens prognosis in patients with COVID19.\\n\\nAuthors: Laura Ghanem, Dina Essayli, Jana Kotaich, Mohammad Al Zein, Amirhossein Sahebkar, Ali H.

However, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) severity varied highly between unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated individuals, for unknown reasons. We assessed the severity of BA.5 infection and the risk of XBB strain reinfection and measured serum levels of NAbs against WT, BA.5, and XBB.1.9.1 SARS-CoV-2 strains at varying time points in 1,373 individuals who received zero, one, two, or three WT vaccine doses. We found that two to three WT doses significantly increased WT and BA.5 NAb levels and reduced the incidence of COVID-19-associated pneumonia upon BA.5 strain infection compared to zero to one dose. Regarding XBB reinfection, those who received two to three doses and were infected with the BA.5 variant exhibited a significantly lower reinfection risk compared to those who received zero to one dose. RNA analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes between the two to three dose and unvaccinated groups were enriched in B cell activation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, complement, and monocyte activation functionsindicating that vaccination increased the antibody response and reduced inflammation. Our results suggest that multiple antigen exposures to either matched or unmatched SARS-COV-2 variants, through vaccination or infection, may be necessary to achieve significant immune imprinting. The administration of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccines that do not perfectly match the viral strains that individuals become infected with has been found to impact the resultant illness severityalthough the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. We assessed viral clearance, as well as serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against wild-type, BA.5, and XBB.1.9.1 variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among individuals who received varying doses of such strain-mismatched vaccines. Notably, vaccination with 2 doses of strain-mismatched COVID-19 vaccines appeared to stimulate the production of specific NAbs during infection with new variants, as well as attenuate the inflammatory response and enhance viral clearance. Such vaccination regimens can also reduce the risk of reinfection. These findings may be important for guiding the development of future COVID-19 vaccination strategies that target both matched and mismatched viral variants.\\n\\nAuthors: Daxiang Chen, Weihong Zhang, Bin Xiao, Banglao Xu, Xiaoyun Yang, Shidong Deng, Guichang Li, Gang Yang, Jinpeng Cao, Xinyue Mei, Qi Luo, Peiyu Huang, Xi Sun, Jie su, Nanshan Zhong, Zhuxiang Zhao, Zhongfang Wang\\n\\nKeywords: SARS-CoV-2, vaccine, neutralizing antibodies, COVID-19 severity, vaccine dose', 'score': 1.0}"

Here, we directly addressed the impact of CS disordered microbiota on the severity of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Specific and opportunistic pathogen-free (SOPF) C57BL/6J mice were exposed to CS or room air (RA) for 5.5 months. Each exposed mouse was then cohoused with a group of recipient germ-free (GF) mice for 1 month for microbial transfer. Colonized GF mice were then infected intranasally with IAV and disease development was monitored. Upper and lower airway and fecal microbiota were longitudinally investigated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bacterial cultures in donor and recipient mice. The bacterial family  Streptococcaceae It has been reported that chronic exposure to CS is associated with a disordered microbiota composition. In this study, we colonized germ-free (GF) mice with the microbiota from SOPF mice which were chronically exposed to CS or RA. This allowed disentangling the effect of the disordered microbiota from the immune-modulating effects of actual CS exposure. We observed a successful transfer of the microbiotas after cohousing including specific microbiota differences induced by CS exposure in formerly GF mice, which were never exposed to CS. We then investigated the effects of IAV infection on the disease course and microbiotas of formerly GF mice. We found that mice with CS-associated microbiota reveal worse disease course compared to the control group. We hypothesize that CS-induced disordering of the microbiota may, indeed, impact the severity of influenza A disease.\\n\\nAuthors: Tsering Wthrich, Simone de Brot, Veronica Richina, Nadja Mostacci, Zora Baumann, Nathan G.

Large outbreaks at meatpacking facilities resulted in loss of life and threatened the well-being of workers across the globe. Much work was done throughout the pandemic to understand and prevent these outbreaks. This study combined ventilation system evaluation and measurement of human-generated respiratory aerosol to investigate and identify areas of highest risk for disease transmission. These findings confirm that improved ventilation reduces exposure to human-generated aerosols in meatpacking facilities, including those that may contain infectious agents, such as SARS-CoV-2. This study suggests areas of greatest risk are likely areas where workers break from work, such as cafeterias and locker rooms, where ventilation is poorer, use of face masks is reduced, and people congregate. Furthermore, these findings also suggest that ventilation of production areas of the plant, which have been designed for food safety, is sufficient to reduce exposures and likely contributes to reduced transmission in those spaces. Based on these findings, two controls should be prioritized to minimize the likelihood of exposure to potentially infectious aerosols: (1) improving mechanical ventilation and/or adding mitigation strategies such as media filters, germicidal ultraviolet, and other air cleaning technology and (2) applying administrative practices that minimize large congregations of people in poorly ventilated spaces.
