Metformin is often the first-line medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It helps lower glucose production in the liver and improves insulin sensitivity.\n\nAuthors: John A.

      "content": "Preoperative management of diabetes mellitus: A comparative narrative review of the recommendations of three professional organizations with Hamad Medical Corporation guidelines\n\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodiumglucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world. While the key elements are agreed upon, more research and global collaboration are needed to create consistent guidelines and improve patient outcomes.\n\nAuthors: Fathima Fahda M.

      "content": "Physiology and Pharmacology of Effects of GLP-1-based Therapies on Gastric, Biliary and Intestinal Motility\n\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1- and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist tirzepatide (referred to here collectively as GLP-1-based therapy) are incretin-based therapies being used increasingly in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity. They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease. In this review, we summarize the effects of GLP-1 and incretin-based therapeutics on gastric, biliary and small intestinal function. An improved understanding of these effects will optimize the use of these drugs.\n\nAuthors: Ryan J Jalleh, Chinmay S Marathe, Christopher K Rayner, Karen L Jones, Mahesh M Umapathysivam, Tongzhi Wu, Daniel R Quast, Mark P Plummer, Michael A Nauck, Michael Horowitz\n\nKeywords: biliary, gastric emptying, glucagon-like peptide-1, hypoglycemia, physiology, small intestinal motility",

      "content": "Effects of Genetic Risk on Incident Type 2 Diabetes and Glycemia: The T2D-GENE Lifestyle Intervention Trial\n\nLifestyle intervention prevents or delays type 2 diabetes (T2D) in subjects at a high risk of T2D. However, it is not known whether genetic variants modify the effect on incident T2D during lifestyle intervention. To investigate whether a low or high genetic risk has effects on incident T2D in a group-based lifestyle intervention study. The T2D-GENE trial involved 973 men from the Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) cohort, aged 50-75 years, body mass index 25 kg/m The intervention significantly lowered the risk of T2D among the participants with a high genetic risk for T2D [hazards ratio (HR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.56,  P P P Our results showed that individuals with a high genetic risk for T2D benefitted from a low-cost group-based intervention focusing on healthy diet and physical activity. Therefore, all individuals at risk of T2D should be encouraged to make lifestyle changes regardless of genetic risk.\n\nAuthors: Maria Anneli Lankinen, Petrus Nuotio, Susanna Kauppinen, Noora Koivu, Ulla Tolonen, Katriina Malkki-Keinnen, Anniina Oravilahti, Teemu Kuulasmaa, Matti Uusitupa, Ursula Schwab, Markku Laakso\n\nKeywords: type 2 diabetes, genetics, diet, clinical trial, human, lifestyle, intervention",
