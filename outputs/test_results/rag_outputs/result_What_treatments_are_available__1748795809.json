These pathologies may be a consequence of complex interactions between neurons and glia before the onset of cognitive impairments. Curcumin, a bioactive compound found in turmeric, is a promising candidate for AD because it alleviates neuropathologies in mouse models of the disease. Although its clinical efficacy has been hindered by low oral bioavailability, the development of new formulations may overcome this limitation. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a bioavailable curcumin formulation in a mouse model of AD. The formulation was administered to mice in drinking water after encapsulation into micelles using a previously validated method. A neuropathological assessment was performed to determine if it slows or alters the course of the disease. Cognitive performance was not included because it had already been assessed by a previous study. The bioavailable curcumin formulation was unable to alter the size or number of amyloid plaques in a transgenic mouse model. In addition, mechanisms that regulate amyloid beta production were unchanged, suggesting that the disease had not been altered. The number of reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus was not altered by curcumin. However, protein levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein were increased overall in the brain, suggesting that it may have aggravated neuroinflammation. Therefore, a higher dosage, despite its enhanced oral bioavailability, may have a potential risk for neuroinflammation.\\n\\nAuthors: Shaun Cade, Clive Prestidge, XinFu Zhou, Larisa Bobrovskaya\\n\\nKeywords: Alzheimer's disease, amyloid pathology, curcumin, neurodegeneration\", 'score': 0.4931376278400421}"

Recent advances in neuroimaging, gene therapy, and gut microbiota research offer new insights and potential intervention strategies. Neuroimaging enables early detection and staging of AD through visualization of biomarkers, aiding diagnosis and tracking of disease progression. Gene therapy presents a promising approach for modifying AD-related genetic expressions, targeting amyloid and tau pathology, and potentially repairing neuronal damage. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota influences AD pathology through the gut-brain axis, impacting inflammation, immune response, and amyloid metabolism. However, each of these technologies faces significant challenges, including concerns about safety, efficacy, and ethical considerations. This article reviews the applications, advantages, and limitations of neuroimaging, gene therapy, and gut microbiota research in AD, with a particular focus on their combined potential for early diagnosis, mechanistic insights, and therapeutic interventions. We propose an integrated approach that leverages these tools to provide a multi-dimensional framework for advancing AD diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.\\n\\nAuthors: Haitao Wang, Chen Shi, Ling Jiang, Xiaozhu Liu, Rui Tang, Mingxi Tang\\n\\nKeywords: Alzheimers Disease, neuroimaging techniques, gene therapy, gut microbiota, frontier advances, interdisciplinary research', 'score': 0.4656970798969269}"

Since Tau aggregation is more closely associated with synaptic loss, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline than A, the correlation between Tau and cognitive function in AD has gradually gained attention. The posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of Tau are key factors contributing to its pathological changes, which include phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation, glycation, small ubiquitinlike modifier mediated modification (SUMOylation), methylation, succinylation, etc. These modifications change the structure of Tau, regulating Tau microtubule interactions, localization, degradation, and aggregation, thereby affecting its propensity to aggregate and leading to neuronal injury and cognitive impairments. Among numerous PTMs, drug development based on phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation primarily involves enzymatic reactions, affecting either the phosphorylation or degradation processes of Tau. Meanwhile, methylation, glycosylation, and succinylation are associated with maintaining the structural stability of Tau. Current research is more extensive on phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and methylation, with related drugs already developed, particularly focusing on phosphorylation and ubiquitination. In contrast, there is less research on SUMOylation, glycosylation, and succinylation, requiring further basic research, with the potential to become novel drug targets. In conclusion, this review summarized the latest research on PTMs of Tau and related drugs, highlighting the potential of targeting specific PTMs for developing novel therapeutic strategies in AD.\\n\\nAuthors: Xin Li, Zhisheng Ba, Juan Huang, Jianhua Chen, Jinyu Jiang, Nanqu Huang, Yong Luo\\n\\nKeywords: Alzheimer's disease, posttranslational modifications, Tau, treatments\", 'score': 0.45957818627357483}"
