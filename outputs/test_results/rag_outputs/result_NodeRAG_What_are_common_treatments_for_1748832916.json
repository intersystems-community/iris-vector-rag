  "answer": "Common treatments for type 2 diabetes typically include lifestyle modifications such as healthy diet, regular exercise, weight management, and monitoring blood sugar levels. Medications like oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin therapy may also be prescribed based on the individual's condition. Monitoring blood glucose levels, regular medical check-ups, and management of associated complications are important components of treatment for type 2 diabetes.",

      "content": "Lipodystrophy With an Uncommon Clinical Presentation in a Patient With Insulin-Requiring Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus\n\nWe report the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy with a history of recurrent and severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy with an uncommon clinical presentation. This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.\n\nKeywords: insulin therapy errors, lipodystrophy, patient safety-based medical education, recurrent hypoglycemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus",

      "content": "Health economic evaluation alongside randomised clinical trial of a health behaviour intervention to manage type 2 diabetes in Nepal\n\nPrevention of type 2 diabetes is becoming an urgent public health concern in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, there is currently no evidence of a cost-effective approach of health behaviour interventions from community settings in low-income countries like Nepal. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the within-trial economic evaluation of a health behaviour intervention compared with usual care for managing type 2 diabetes in a community setting in Nepal. We randomly assigned 30 clusters comprising 481 patients with type 2 diabetes of which 15 to a health behaviour intervention ( n n Over the 6-month, the intervention yielded an incremental cost of US $28.55 (95% CI=US $21.26 to US $35.84) per person and an incremental QALYs of 0.0085 (95% CI=-0.0106 to 0.0275) per person. The ICER associated with the health behaviour intervention was US $3,358.82 (95% CI=US $-2005.66 to US $3,974.54) per QALY gained, which was below the estimated threshold, indicating a cost-effective approach with a net monetary benefit of US $6.64 (95% CI=US $-22.62 to US $78.01). Furthermore, the probabilistic sensitivity analysis consisting of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations indicates that the intervention being cost-effective at the given threshold was 89.63%. Health behaviour interventions in community settings are a cost-effective approach to manage type 2 diabetes, offering good value for money. However, more studies focused on long-term follow-up across diverse setting of LMICs should be warranted to assess the maximum impact of such interventions.

      "content": "Effects of Genetic Risk on Incident Type 2 Diabetes and Glycemia: The T2D-GENE Lifestyle Intervention Trial\n\nLifestyle intervention prevents or delays type 2 diabetes (T2D) in subjects at a high risk of T2D. However, it is not known whether genetic variants modify the effect on incident T2D during lifestyle intervention. To investigate whether a low or high genetic risk has effects on incident T2D in a group-based lifestyle intervention study. The T2D-GENE trial involved 973 men from the Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) cohort, aged 50-75 years, body mass index 25 kg/m The intervention significantly lowered the risk of T2D among the participants with a high genetic risk for T2D [hazards ratio (HR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.56,  P P P Our results showed that individuals with a high genetic risk for T2D benefitted from a low-cost group-based intervention focusing on healthy diet and physical activity. Therefore, all individuals at risk of T2D should be encouraged to make lifestyle changes regardless of genetic risk.\n\nAuthors: Maria Anneli Lankinen, Petrus Nuotio, Susanna Kauppinen, Noora Koivu, Ulla Tolonen, Katriina Malkki-Keinnen, Anniina Oravilahti, Teemu Kuulasmaa, Matti Uusitupa, Ursula Schwab, Markku Laakso\n\nKeywords: type 2 diabetes, genetics, diet, clinical trial, human, lifestyle, intervention",

      "content": "Preoperative management of diabetes mellitus: A comparative narrative review of the recommendations of three professional organizations with Hamad Medical Corporation guidelines\n\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodiumglucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world. While the key elements are agreed upon, more research and global collaboration are needed to create consistent guidelines and improve patient outcomes.\n\nAuthors: Fathima Fahda M.
