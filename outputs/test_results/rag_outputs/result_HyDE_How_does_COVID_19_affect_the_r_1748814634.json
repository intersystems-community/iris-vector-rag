      "content": "Phenotypic switch of vascular smooth muscle cells in COVID19: Role of cholesterol, calcium, and phosphate\n\nAlthough the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), primarily manifests as severe respiratory distress, its impact on the cardiovascular system is also notable. Studies reveal that COVID19 patients often suffer from certain vascular diseases, partly attributed to increased proliferation or altered phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Although the association between COVID19 and VSMCs is recognized, the precise mechanism underlying SARSCoV2's influence on VSMC phenotype remains largely underreviewed. In this context, while there is a consistent body of literature dissecting the effect of COVID19 on the cardiovascular system, few reports delve into the potential role of VSMC switching in the pathophysiology associated with COVID19 and the molecular mechanisms involved therein. This review dissects and critiques the link between COVID19 and VSMCs, with particular attention to pathways involving cholesterol, calcium, and phosphate. These pathways underpin the interaction between the virus and VSMCs. Such interaction promotes VSMC proliferation, and eventually potentiates vascular calcification as well as worsens prognosis in patients with COVID19.\n\nAuthors: Laura Ghanem, Dina Essayli, Jana Kotaich, Mohammad Al Zein, Amirhossein Sahebkar, Ali H.

      "content": "Effect of wild-type vaccine doses on BA.5 hybrid immunity, disease severity, and XBB reinfection risk\n\nVaccination against the wild-type (WT) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus did not produce detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the BA.5 strain before it emerged. However, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) severity varied highly between unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated individuals, for unknown reasons. We assessed the severity of BA.5 infection and the risk of XBB strain reinfection and measured serum levels of NAbs against WT, BA.5, and XBB.1.9.1 SARS-CoV-2 strains at varying time points in 1,373 individuals who received zero, one, two, or three WT vaccine doses. We found that two to three WT doses significantly increased WT and BA.5 NAb levels and reduced the incidence of COVID-19-associated pneumonia upon BA.5 strain infection compared to zero to one dose. Regarding XBB reinfection, those who received two to three doses and were infected with the BA.5 variant exhibited a significantly lower reinfection risk compared to those who received zero to one dose. RNA analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes between the two to three dose and unvaccinated groups were enriched in B cell activation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, complement, and monocyte activation functionsindicating that vaccination increased the antibody response and reduced inflammation. Our results suggest that multiple antigen exposures to either matched or unmatched SARS-COV-2 variants, through vaccination or infection, may be necessary to achieve significant immune imprinting. The administration of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccines that do not perfectly match the viral strains that individuals become infected with has been found to impact the resultant illness severityalthough the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. We assessed viral clearance, as well as serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against wild-type, BA.5, and XBB.1.9.1 variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among individuals who received varying doses of such strain-mismatched vaccines. Notably, vaccination with 2 doses of strain-mismatched COVID-19 vaccines appeared to stimulate the production of specific NAbs during infection with new variants, as well as attenuate the inflammatory response and enhance viral clearance. Such vaccination regimens can also reduce the risk of reinfection. These findings may be important for guiding the development of future COVID-19 vaccination strategies that target both matched and mismatched viral variants.\n\nAuthors: Daxiang Chen, Weihong Zhang, Bin Xiao, Banglao Xu, Xiaoyun Yang, Shidong Deng, Guichang Li, Gang Yang, Jinpeng Cao, Xinyue Mei, Qi Luo, Peiyu Huang, Xi Sun, Jie su, Nanshan Zhong, Zhuxiang Zhao, Zhongfang Wang\n\nKeywords: SARS-CoV-2, vaccine, neutralizing antibodies, COVID-19 severity, vaccine dose",

      "content": "Recombination across distant coronavirid species and genera is a rare event with distinct genomic features\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; family  Coronaviridae Betacoronavirus Sarbecovirus N Understanding the evolutionary events that led to SARS-CoV-2 emergence, spillover, and spread is crucial to prevent, or at least be prepared for, the same type of occurrence in the future. Given that SARS-CoV-2 has some characteristics not found in other closely related viruses, we aimed to systematically assess how likely these unique features may have been acquired through recombination. We found that, although recombination is a frequent phenomenon among betacoronaviruses, it is mostly limited to closely related members of the same species. Therefore, we conclude that the most likely scenario involved feature acquisition from recombination with a closely related virus that was circulating in a geographically overlapping area or through a different biological process, but not recombination from a virus of a different species, genus, or subgenus.\n\nAuthors: Juan Patio-Galindo, Adolfo Garca-Sastre, Jens H.

      "content": "Oral Health Implications of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19: A Systematic Review\n\nThe aim of this sytematic review was to evaluate the potential association of COVID-19 infection with oral health. Screening in different databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Embase databases) was performed to identify relevant articles, focusing on the oral health of patients with COVID-19, and published up to November 2021. 5194 articles were identified, and 29 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Patients presenting more severe periodontal or dental diseases were at an increased risk of developing COVID-19 complications and being admitted to intensive care units. According to the included articles, U-shaped lingual papillitis and aphthous-like ulcers on the tongue are the most frequent lesions assessed in the oral cavity of COVID-19 patients, while xerostomia seems to be an early COVID-19 diagnostic symptom. Apart from the presence of the virus, the global lockdown had a detrimental impact on oral health. The occurrence of dental emergencies was augmented during this time due to the postponement of numerous non-emergency dental procedures. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in periodontal tissues and salivary fractions may explain the presence of oral lesions during the infection. However, the viruss direct or indirect effect on oral mucosa is unclear. It is important to consider that these manifestations might be attributed to underlying comorbidities, or co-existing or subsequent lesions produced by local irritants.\n\nAuthors: Maria Vilar Doceda, Marianna Gavriiloglou, Catherine Petit, Olivier Huck\n\nKeywords: COVID-19, oral health, oral manifestation, periodontal diseases, SARS-CoV-2",
