While condition-specific ICF Core Sets are useful, a Generic ICF Core Set is needed to describe and compare problems in functioning across health conditions. The aims of the multi-centre, cross-sectional study presented here were: a) to propose a method to select ICF categories when a large amount of ICF-based data have to be handled, and b) to identify candidate ICF categories for a Generic ICF Core Set by examining their explanatory power in relation to item one of the SF-36. The data were collected from 1039 patients using the ICF checklist, the SF-36 and a Comorbidity Questionnaire. ICF categories to be entered in an initial regression model were selected following systematic steps in accordance with the ICF structure. Based on an initial regression model, additional models were designed by systematically substituting the ICF categories included in it with ICF categories with which they were highly correlated. Fourteen different regression models were performed. The variance the performed models account for ranged from 22.27% to 24.0%. The ICF category that explained the highest amount of variance in all the models was  sensation of pain The selection strategy based on the ICF structure and the examination of the best possible alternative models does not provide a final answer about which ICF categories must be considered, but leads to a selection of suitable candidates which needs further consideration and comparison with the results of other selection strategies in developing a Generic ICF Core Set.\n\nAuthors: Alarcos Cieza, Szilvia Geyh, Somnath Chatterji, Nenad Kostanjsek, Bedirhan T \u00dcst\u00fcn, Gerold Stucki",
          "A biological question and a balanced (orthogonal) design: the ingredients to efficiently analyze two-color microarrays with Confirmatory Factor Analysis\n\nFactor analysis (FA) has been widely applied in microarray studies as a data-reduction-tool without any a-priori assumption regarding associations between observed data and latent structure (Exploratory Factor Analysis). A disadvantage is that the representation of data in a reduced set of dimensions can be difficult to interpret, as biological contrasts do not necessarily coincide with single dimensions. However, FA can also be applied as an instrument to confirm what is expected on the basis of pre-established hypotheses (Confirmatory Factor Analysis, CFA). We show that with a hypothesis incorporated in a balanced (orthogonal) design, including 'SelfSelf' hybridizations, dye swaps and independent replications, FA can be used to identify the latent factors underlying the correlation structure among the observed two-color microarray data. An orthogonal design will reflect the principal components associated with each experimental factor. We applied CFA to a microarray study performed to investigate cisplatin resistance in four ovarian cancer cell lines, which only differ in their degree of cisplatin resistance. Two latent factors, coinciding with principal components, representing the differences in cisplatin resistance between the four ovarian cancer cell lines were easily identified. From these two factors 315 genes associated with cisplatin resistance were selected, 199 genes from the first factor (False Discovery Rate (FDR): 19%) and 152 (FDR: 24%) from the second factor, while both gene sets shared 36. The differential expression of 16 genes was validated with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Our results show that FA is an efficient method to analyze two-color microarray data provided that there is a pre-defined hypothesis reflected in an orthogonal design.\n\nAuthors: Anne PG Crijns, Frans Gerbens, A Edo D Plantinga, Gert Jan Meersma, Steven de Jong, Robert MW Hofstra, Elisabeth GE de Vries, Ate GJ van der Zee, Geertruida H de Bock, Gerard J te Meerman",

          "Comparative Analyses of Plant Transcription Factor Databases\n\nTranscription factors (TFs) are proteinaceous complex, which bind to the promoter regions in the DNA and affect transcription initiation. Plant TFs control gene expressions and genes control many physiological processes, which in turn trigger cascades of biochemical reactions in plant cells. The databases available for plant TFs are somewhat abundant but all convey different information and in different formats. Some of the publicly available plant TF databases may be narrow, while others are broad in scopes. For example, some of the best TF databases are ones that are very specific with just one plant species, but there are also other databases that contain a total of up to 20 different plant species. In this review plant TF databases ranging from a single species to many will be assessed and described. The comparative analyses of all the databases and their advantages and disadvantages are also discussed.\n\nAuthors: Silvia R Ramirez, Chhandak Basu\n\nKeywords: Plant transcription factor databases, bioinformatics.",
          "Down-Regulation of Platelet Surface CD47 Expression in \n\nPlatelet depletion is a key feature of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) caused by Shiga toxin-producing  Escherichia coli Here we demonstrated for the first time that platelet surface expression of CD47 was significantly decreased in C57BL6 mice treated with concentrated culture filtrates (CCF) from STEC O157:H7. STEC O157:H7 CCF treatment also led to a sharp drop of platelet counts. The reduction of cell surface CD47 was specific for platelets but not for neutrophil, monocytes and red blood cells. Down-regulation of platelet surface CD47 was also observed in isolated human platelets treated with O157:H7 CCF. Platelet surface CD47 reduction by O157:H7 CCF could be blocked by anti-TLR4 antibody but not anti-CD62 antibody. Down-regulation of platelet surface CD47 was positively correlated with platelet activation and phagocytosis by human monocyte-derived macrophages. Furthermore, the enhanced phagocytosis process of O157:H7 CCF-treated platelets was abolished by addition of soluble CD47 recombinants. Our results suggest that platelet CD47 down-regulation may be a novel mechanism underneath STEC-induced platelet depletion, and that the interactions between CD47 and its receptor, signal regulatory protein \u03b1 (SIRP\u03b1), play an essential role in modulating platelet homeostasis.\n\nAuthors: Ya-Lan Guo, Dan-Qing Liu, Zhen Bian, Chen-Yu Zhang, Ke Zen",
          "Multigene expression of protein complexes by iterative modification of genomic Bacmid DNA\n\nMany cellular multi-protein complexes are naturally present in cells at low abundance. Baculovirus expression offers one approach to produce milligram quantities of correctly folded and processed eukaryotic protein complexes. However, current strategies suffer from the need to produce large transfer vectors, and the use of repeated promoter sequences in baculovirus, which itself produces proteins that promote homologous recombination. One possible solution to these problems is to construct baculovirus genomes that express each protein in a complex from a separate locus within the viral DNA. However current methods for selecting such recombinant genomes are too inefficient to routinely modify the virus in this way. This paper reports a method which combines the lambda red and bacteriophage P1 Cre-recombinase systems to efficiently generate baculoviruses in which protein complexes are expressed from multiple, single-locus insertions of foreign genes. This method is based on an 88 fold improvement in the selection of recombinant viruses generated by red recombination techniques through use of a bipartite selection cassette. Using this system, seven new genetic loci were identified in the AcMNPV genome suitable for the high level expression of recombinant proteins. These loci were used to allow the recovery two recombinant virus-like particles with potential biotechnological applications (influenza A virus HA/M1 particles and bluetongue virus VP2/VP3/VP5/VP7 particles) and the mammalian chaperone and cancer drug target CCT (16 subunits formed from 8 proteins). 1 2 p10  ctx, egt, 39k, orf51, gp37, iap2  odv-e56  3\n\nAuthors: Rob J Noad, Meredith Stewart, Mark Boyce, Cristina C Celma, Keith R Willison, Polly Roy",

          "Understanding the explanatory model of the patient on their medically unexplained symptoms and its implication on treatment development research: a Sri Lanka Study\n\nPatients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are often distressed, disabled and dissatisfied with the care they receive. Illness beliefs held by patients have a major influence on the decision to consult, persistence of symptoms and the degree of disability. Illness perception models consist of frameworks to organise information from multiple sources into distinct but interrelated dimensions: identity (the illness label), cause, consequences, emotional representations perceived control and timeline. Our aim was to elicit the illness perceptions of patients with MUS in Sri Lankan primary care to modify and improve a CBT intervention. An intervention study was conducted in a hospital primary care clinic in Colombo, Sri Lanka using CBT for MUS. As a part of the baseline assessment, qualitative data was collected using; the Short Explanatory Model Interview (SEMI), from 68 patients (16\u201365 years) with MUS. We categorised the qualitative data in to key components of the illness perception model, to refine CBT intervention for a subsequent larger trial study. The cohort was chronically ill and 87% of the patients were ill for more than six months (range six months to 20 years) with 5 or more symptoms and 6 or more visits over preceding six months. A majority were unable to offer an explanation on identity (59%) or the cause (56%), but in the consequence domain 95% expressed significant illness worries; 37% believed their symptoms indicated moderately serious illness and 58% very serious illness. Reflecting emotional representation, 33% reported fear of death, 20% fear of paralysis, 13% fear of developing cancer and the rest unspecified incurable illness. Consequence and emotional domains were significant determinants of distress and consultations. Their repeated visits were to seek help to alleviate symptoms. Only a minority expected investigations (8.8 %) or diagnosis (8.8%). However, the doctors who had previously treated them allegedly concentrated more on identity than cause. The above information was used to develop simple techniques incorporating analogies to alter their perceptions The illness perception model is useful in understanding the continued distress of patients with persistent symptoms without an underlying organic cause. Hence it can make a significant contribution when developing and evaluating culturally sensitive patient friendly interventions.\n\nAuthors: Athula Sumathipala, Sisira Siribaddana, Suwin Hewege, Kethaki Sumathipala, Martin Prince, Anthony Mann",
          "Collection of the BD SurePath Pap Test with a broom device plus endocervical brush improves disease detection when compared to the broom device alone or the spatula plus endocervical brush combination\n\nHere we examine the diagnostic utility of the US Food And Drug Administration (FDA) approved Spatula + endocervical brush combination for the BD SurePath Pap Test (SPPT) and compare it to SPPT collection with the broom alone or to an off-label combination of broom + EC brush. This question is important due to lingering concerns over the value of EC detection to a satisfactory Pap test. 20,125 SPPT vials were examined for the collection devices contained. The SPPT collection device combinations allowed were: Rovers Cervex-Brush (broom, FDA approved), Medscand Pap Perfect Spatula + Medscand CytoBrush Plus GT (spatula + GT brush, FDA approved) or Rovers Cervex-Brush + Surgipath C-E Brush (broom + CE brush, off label). Examination of SPPT vials revealed 11,130 collected with the broom, 4,687 collected with the spatula + GT brush and 2,921 collected with the broom + CE brush. Absence of an endocervical/transformation zone was seen in 22.86% of broom cases, 13.10% of spatula + GT brush cases (p= 0.00005 vs broom) and 10.17% of broom + CE brush cases (p= 0.00005 vs broom, p= 0.00005 vs spatula + GT brush). Importantly, LSIL detection was: broom 2.99%; spatula + GT brush 2.45% (p= 0.053 vs broom); broom + CE brush 4.18% (p= 0.034 vs broom, p= 0.0001 vs spatula + GT brush). When broom + brush combination is compared to broom alone or to spatula + GT brush, the broom + CE brush combination better sampled the endocervical/transformation zone and increased LSIL detection.\n\nAuthors: Sharon Davis-Devine, Sarah J.

          "Functional correlates of Apolipoprotein E genotype in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration\n\nIt has been recently demonstrated that in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) memory deficits at presentation are commoner than previously thought. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype, the major genetic risk factor in sporadic late-onset Alzheimer Disease (AD), modulates cerebral perfusion in late middle-age cognitively normal subjects. ApoE \u03b54 homozygous have reduced glucose metabolism in the same regions involved in AD. The aim of this study was to determine whether ApoE genotype might play a key-role in influencing the cerebral functional pattern as well as the degree of memory deficits in FTLD patients. Fifty-two unrelated FTLD patients entered the study and underwent a somatic and neurological evaluation, laboratory examinations, a brain structural imaging study, and a brain functional Single Photon Emission Tomography study. ApoE genotype was determined. ApoE genotype influenced both clinical and functional features in FTLD. ApoE \u03b54-carriers were more impaired in long-term memory function (ApoE \u03b54 vs. ApoE non \u03b54, 6.3 \u00b1 3.9 vs. 10.1 \u00b1 4.2, p = 0.004) and more hypoperfused in uncus and parahippocampal regions (x,y,z = 38,-6,-20, T = 2.82, cluster size = 100 voxels; -32,-12,-28, T= 2.77, cluster size = 40 voxels). The present findings support the view that ApoE genotype might be considered a disease-modifying factor in FTLD, thus contributing to define a specific clinical presentation, and might be of relevance for pharmacological approaches.\n\nAuthors: Barbara Borroni, Daniela Perani, Silvana Archetti, Chiara Agosti, Barbara Paghera, Giuseppe Bellelli, Monica Di Luca, Alessandro Padovani",

For Hippuran clearance and GFR, analysed with the X-ray contrast (iohexol) and fluorescence technique, the least square linear regression coefficient was 5.01 +/- 0.41 (r = 0.91). This value concurs with the five to one ratio between GFR and renal plasma flow known from normal physiology and supports that Hippuran clearance is a valid measure of renal function. When the individual values of Hippuran clearance were divided by 5.01, the mean difference between the methods was 0.4 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 with standard deviation 13.4 ml min-1 1.73 m-2. The lower and upper limits of agreement were -26.7 and 25.9 ml min-1 1.73 m-2, respectively. Comparing creatinine clearance estimated from the serum creatinine level with GFR, the limits of agreement were -29.4 and 21.6 ml min-1 1.73 m-2. These agreement limits are in the same range as those which can be calculated from the data from other studies.\n\nAuthors: M. W. Lindegaard, N. Aass, E. S. Bue, L. Theodorsen, S. D. Foss\u00e5",

We administered the GPCCI to 28 general practitioners (family physicians) in 10 general practices. We conducted an item analysis and assessed the internal consistency of the instrument. We next assessed the quality of care recorded in the medical records of 462 of the general practitioners' patients with Type 2 diabetes, ischaemic heart disease/hypertension and/or moderate to severe asthma. This was then compared with results of the GPCCI for each general practice. Good internal consistency was found for the overall GPCCI (Cronbach's alpha = 0.75). As far as the separate sub-scales were concerned, diabetes had good internal consistency (0.76) but the internal consistency of the heart disease and asthma subscales was not strong (0.49 and 0.16 respectively). There was high inter-rater reliability of the adjusted scores of data extracted from patients' medical notes for each of the three conditions. Correlations of the overall GPCCI and patients' medical notes audit, combined across the three conditions and aggregated to practice level, showed that a strong relationship (r = 0.84, p = 0.003) existed between the two indices of clinical care. This study suggests that the GPCCI has good internal consistency and concurrent validity with patients' medical records in Australian general practice and warrants further evaluation of its properties, validity and utility.\n\nAuthors: Judith Proudfoot, Upali W Jayasinghe, Fernando Infante, Justin Beilby, Cheryl Amoroso, Gawaine Powell Davies, Jane Grimm, Christine Holton, Tanya Bubner, Mark Harris",
          "i-Tracker: For quantitative proteomics using iTRAQ\u2122\n\niTRAQ\u2122 technology for protein quantitation using mass spectrometry is a recent, powerful means of determining relative protein levels in up to four samples simultaneously. Although protein identification of samples generated using iTRAQ may be carried out using any current identification software, the quantitation calculations have been restricted to the ProQuant software supplied by Applied Biosciences. i-Tracker software has been developed to extract reporter ion peak ratios from non-centroided tandem MS peak lists in a format easily linked to the results of protein identification tools such as Mascot and Sequest. Such functionality is currently not provided by ProQuant, which is restricted to matching quantitative information to the peptide identifications from Applied Biosciences' Interrogator\u2122 software. i-Tracker is shown to generate results that are consistent with those produced by ProQuant, thus validating both systems. i-Tracker allows quantitative information gained using the iTRAQ protocol to be linked with peptide identifications from popular tandem MS identification tools and hence is both a timely and useful tool for the proteomics community.\n\nAuthors: Ian P Shadforth, Tom PJ Dunkley, Kathryn S Lilley, Conrad Bessant",

          "Hypoxia-activated genes from early placenta are elevated in Preeclampsia, but not in Intra-Uterine Growth Retardation\n\nAs a first step to explore the possible relationships existing between the effects of low oxygen pressure in the first trimester placenta and placental pathologies developing from mid-gestation, two subtracted libraries totaling 2304 cDNA clones were constructed. For achieving this, two reciprocal suppressive/subtractive hybridization procedures (SSH) were applied to early (11 weeks) human placental villi after incubation either in normoxic or in hypoxic conditions. The clones from both libraries (1440 hypoxia-specific and 864 normoxia-specific) were spotted on nylon macroarrays. Complex cDNAs probes prepared from placental villi (either from early pregnancy, after hypoxic or normoxic culture conditions, or near term for controls or pathological placentas) were hybridized to the membranes. Three hundred and fifty nine clones presenting a hybridization signal above the background were sequenced and shown to correspond to 276 different genes. Nine of these genes are mitochondrial, while 267 are nuclear. Specific expression profiles characteristic of preeclampsia (PE) could be identified, as well as profiles specific of intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR). Focusing on the chromosomal distribution of the fraction of genes that responded in at least one hybridization experiment, we could observe a highly significant chromosomal clustering of 54 genes into 8 chromosomal regions, four of which containing imprinted genes. Comparative mapping data indicate that these imprinted clusters are maintained in synteny in mice, and apparently in cattle and pigs, suggesting that the maintenance of such syntenies is requested for achieving a normal placental physiology in eutherian mammals.

In the absence of shields, children have more vertebrae exposed than adults (p < 0.0001) and females have more neck tissue exposed inferior to the hyoid bone than males (p < 0.0001). The hyoid bone-porion distance increased with age (p <0.01). Thyroid shields were visible in 19% of the radiographs and depended strongly on the calendar year during which patient was seen (p-value <0.0001).

          "Flow cytometric analysis of DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction from prostatic carcinomas: implications for prognosis and response to endocrine therapy.\n\nWe analysed ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) from 78 paraffin-embedded primary prostatic carcinomas by DNA flow cytometry. DNA aneuploidy and above median (4.2%) SPF were both associated with high tumour grade, large size of prostate and presence of distant metastases. Both aneuploidy and high SPF (greater than 4.2%) indicated short 10-year progression-free (P = 0.01 for ploidy and P = 0.0002 for SPF), overall (P = 0.004 and P less than 0.0001) as well as prostate cancer survival (P = 0.002 and P less than 0.0001). Ten-year overall survival rate was 45% in cases with SPF below 4.2% and 0% in those with higher values, whereas the corresponding prostate cancer-specific survival rates were 80% and 11%, respectively. None of the seven tumours with SPF above 12% showed an objective response to endocrine therapy, whereas 26/49 (52%) of those with lower SPF values responded (P = 0.01). DNA ploidy, tumour grade, T-stage or M-stage did not significantly correlate with endocrine responsiveness. SPF was also the best predictor of progression free survival in patients treated hormonally. In conclusion, detection of high SPF in prostate cancer may indicate lack of hormonal responsiveness and poor prognosis.\n\nAuthors: T. Visakorpi, O. P. Kallioniemi, I. Y. Paronen, J. J. Isola, A. I.

          "Quantitative prediction of mouse class I MHC peptide binding affinity using support vector machine regression (SVR) models\n\nThe binding between peptide epitopes and major histocompatibility complex proteins (MHCs) is an important event in the cellular immune response. Accurate prediction of the binding between short peptides and the MHC molecules has long been a principal challenge for immunoinformatics. Recently, the modeling of MHC-peptide binding has come to emphasize quantitative predictions: instead of categorizing peptides as \"binders\" or \"non-binders\" or as \"strong binders\" and \"weak binders\", recent methods seek to make predictions about precise binding affinities. We developed a quantitative support vector machine regression (SVR) approach, called SVRMHC, to model peptide-MHC binding affinities. As a non-linear method, SVRMHC was able to generate models that out-performed existing linear models, such as the \"additive method\". By adopting a new \"11-factor encoding\" scheme, SVRMHC takes into account similarities in the physicochemical properties of the amino acids constituting the input peptides. When applied to MHC-peptide binding data for three mouse class I MHC alleles, the SVRMHC models produced more accurate predictions than those produced previously. Furthermore, comparisons based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that SVRMHC was able to out-perform several prominent methods in identifying strongly binding peptides. As a method with demonstrated performance in the quantitative modeling of MHC-peptide binding and in identifying strong binders, SVRMHC is a promising immunoinformatics tool with not inconsiderable future potential.\n\nAuthors: Wen Liu, Xiangshan Meng, Qiqi Xu, Darren R Flower, Tongbin Li",

DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism, has been associated with cancer initiation and progression. Greenlandic Inuit have some of the highest reported POP levels worldwide. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the relationship between plasma POPs concentrations and global DNA methylation (percent 5-methylcytosine) in DNA extracted from blood samples from 70 Greenlandic Inuit. Blood samples were collected under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program and previously analyzed for a battery of POPs.

          "Favorable prognostic value of SOCS2 and IGF-I in breast cancer\n\nSuppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins comprise a protein family, which has initially been described as STAT induced inhibitors of the Jak/Stat pathway. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that SOCS proteins are also implicated in cancer. The STAT5 induced IGF-I acts as an endocrine and para/autocrine growth and differentiation factor in mammary gland development. Whereas high levels of circulating IGF-I have been associated with increased cancer risk, the role of autocrine acting IGF-I is less clear. The present study is aimed to elucidate the clinicopathological features associated with SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, CIS and IGF-I expression in breast cancer. We determined the mRNA expression levels of SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, CIS and IGF-I in 89 primary breast cancers by reverse transcriptase PCR. SOCS2 protein expression was further evaluated by immuno-blot and immunohistochemistry. SOCS2 expression inversely correlated with histopathological grade and ER positive tumors exhibited higher SOCS2 levels. Patients with high SOCS2 expression lived significantly longer (108.7 vs. 77.7 months; P = 0.015) and high SOCS2 expression proved to be an independent predictor for good prognosis (HR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.23 \u2013 0.91, P = 0.026). In analogy to SOCS2, high IGF-I expression was an independent predictor for good prognosis in the entire patient cohort. In the subgroup of patients with lymph-node negative disease, high IGF-I was a strong predictor for favorable outcome in terms of overall survival and relapse free survival (HR = 0.075, 95% CI 0.014 \u2013 0.388, P = 0.002). This is the first report on the favorable prognostic value of high SOCS2 expression in primary mammary carcinomas. Furthermore a strong association of high IGF-I expression levels with good prognosis was observed especially in lymph-node negative patients. Our results suggest that high expression of the STAT5 target genes SOCS2 and IGF-I is a feature of differentiated and less malignant tumors.\n\nAuthors: Michael C Haffner, Barbara Petridou, Jean Phillipe Peyrat, Fran\u00e7oise R\u00e9villion, Elisabeth M\u00fcller-Holzner, G\u00fcnter Daxenbichler, Christian Marth, Wolfgang Doppler",

          "Social capital and health: Does egalitarianism matter? A literature review\n\nThe aim of the paper is to critically review the notion of social capital and review empirical literature on the association between social capital and health across countries. The methodology used for the review includes a systematic search on electronic databases for peer-reviewed published literature. We categorize studies according to level of analysis (single and multilevel) and examine whether studies reveal a significant health impact of individual and area level social capital. We compare the study conclusions according to the country's degrees of economic egalitarianism. Regardless of study design, our findings indicate that a positive association (fixed effect) exists between social capital and better health irrespective of countries degree of egalitarianism. However, we find that the between-area variance (random effect) in health tends to be lower in more egalitarian countries than in less egalitarian countries. Our tentative conclusion is that an association between social capital and health at the individual level is robust with respect to the degree of egalitarianism within a country. Area level or contextual social capital may be less salient in egalitarian countries in explaining health differences across places.\n\nAuthors: M Kamrul Islam, Juan Merlo, Ichiro Kawachi, Martin Lindstr\u00f6m, Ulf-G Gerdtham",

          "Circadian Remodeling of Neuronal Circuits Involved in Rhythmic Behavior\n\nClock output pathways are central to convey timing information from the circadian clock to a diversity of physiological systems, ranging from cell-autonomous processes to behavior. While the molecular mechanisms that generate and sustain rhythmicity at the cellular level are well understood, it is unclear how this information is further structured to control specific behavioral outputs. Rhythmic release of pigment dispersing factor (PDF) has been proposed to propagate the time of day information from core pacemaker cells to downstream targets underlying rhythmic locomotor activity. Indeed, such circadian changes in PDF intensity represent the only known mechanism through which the PDF circuit could communicate with its output. Here we describe a novel circadian phenomenon involving extensive remodeling in the axonal terminals of the PDF circuit, which display higher complexity during the day and significantly lower complexity at nighttime, both under daily cycles and constant conditions. In support to its circadian nature, cycling is lost in bona fide clockless mutants. We propose this clock-controlled structural plasticity as a candidate mechanism contributing to the transmission of the information downstream of pacemaker cells.\n\nAuthors: Mar\u00eda Paz Fern\u00e1ndez, Jimena Berni, Mar\u00eda Fernanda Ceriani",

          "A qualitative study of the learning processes in young physicians treating suicidal patients: from insecurity to personal pattern knowledge and self-confidence\n\nLittle empirical work has been done in studying learning processes among newly educated physicians in the mental health field. The aim of the study was to shed light on the meaning of newly educated physicians' lived experiences of learning processes related to treating suicidal patients. Thirteen newly educated physicians narrated their learning experiences while treating suicidal patients in their own practice. The interview texts were transcribed and interpreted using a phenomenological-hermeneutical method inspired by Ricoeur's philosophy. There was one main theme, four themes and eleven sub themes. The main theme was: Being in a transitional learning process. The themes and sub themes were: Preparing for practice (Getting tools and training skills, Becoming aware of one's own attitudes); Gaining experience from treating patients (Treating and following up patients over time, Storing memories and recognizing similarities and differences in patients); Participating in the professional community (Being an apprentice, Relating clinical stories and receiving feedback, Sharing emotions from clinical experiences, Receiving support from peers); and Developing personal competence (Having unarticulated awareness, Having emotional knowledge, Achieving self-confidence). The informants gave a detailed account of the learning process; from recognising similarities and differences in patients they have treated, to accumulating pattern knowledge, which then contributed to their personal feelings of competence and confidence. They described their personal competence with cognitive and emotional elements consisting of both articulated and less articulated knowledge. The findings are interpreted in relation to different learning theories that focus on both individual factors and the interaction with the learning environment. This study provides additional information about learning experiences of young physicians during the critical transition phase from medical school to early professional life. Peers are used for both learning and support and might represent a more powerful resource in the learning process than previously recognized. Emotional experiences do not seem to be adequately focused upon in supervision, which obviously has relevance both for learning and for the well-being of young professionals. The study indicates some areas of the educational system that could profitably be expanded including stimulating more systematically to critical reflection on and in practice, attention to feelings in the reflective process and provision of more performance feedback to young physicians.\n\nAuthors: Tordis S\u00f8rensen H\u00f8if\u00f8dt, Anne-Grethe Talseth, Reidun Olstad",

In order to determine what kinds of cell and factor(s) enable QR-32 cells to promote PGE2 production, we investigated the amounts of PGE2 in the supernatant of QR-32 cells by co-culturing them with various anti-tumour effector cells. Significantly high levels of PGE2 production were observed when the QR-32 cells were co-cultured with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, natural killer (NK) cells, polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes and streptococcal preparation (OK432)-activated or resident peritoneal macrophages (activated and resident macrophages). On the other hand, PGE2 production was not increased when QR-32 cells were co-cultured with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific to QR-32 cells. The high levels of PGE2 production were partially or totally inhibited by the presence of radical scavengers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and mannitol, although the cytotoxicity of LAK cells was not. We also exposed QR-32 cells to human recombinant cytokines and the growth factors which are produced when anti-tumour effector cells come in contact with tumour cells. Significant PGE2 production by QR-32 cells was observed when the cells were treated with interferon alpha (IFN-alpha), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) (all P < 0.001). These results suggest that oxygen radicals produced by anti-tumour effector cells and inflammatory cytokines provoke QR-32 cells to produce large amounts of immunosuppressive PGE2.\n\nAuthors: F.

          "Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) has recently become available for the treatment of chronic anaemia, including that associated with cancer. Carcinoma NT in CBA mice causes a progressive anaemia which can be overcome by daily injections of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo). This model was used to study the effect of haematocrit on tumour blood flow, growth rate and radiosensitivity, in mice with haematocrits ranging from approximately 38% (control) to 65% (20 U/day rHuEpo). Tumours showed a small but significant slowing in growth rate with higher haematocrit. In vitro studies showed rHuEpo had no direct effect on the growth of NT cells. Tumour blood flow was measured by two methods in each mouse (133Xe clearance and 86Rubidium uptake). Blood flow showed a tendency to decrease with increasing blood viscosity although this effect was not significant despite the large differences in haematocrit. Although tumour doubling time was prolonged despite the large differences in haematocrit. Although tumour doubling time was prolonged with increasing radiation dose, from 0 (sham irradiated) to 35 Gy, haematocrit was not found to influence the growth delay. This was attributed to adaptation of the tumour during the relatively slow change in the haematocrit. rHuEpo is being considered for clinical use in anaemic cancer patients. Our data suggest that this treatment will correct haematocrit with no effect on tumour radiosensitivity.",
          "The influence of the host on the course of gastric carcinoma.\n\nImmunoglobulins (Ig) and some complement components (C) were quantified in sera from patients with gastric carcinoma before surgery and at regular intervals during a 5-year follow-up. The preoperative concentrations of C1-INH and C4 were higher (P < 0.0005 and P < 0.005) and IgG lower (P < 0.0005) in 50 patients with recurrence than in 46 5-year survivors. The prognostic significant of C1-INH was superior to that of the extent of disease (F-values 37.1 and 26.1). The preoperative immune data classified 76% of the patients correctly as to recurrence and no recurrence. Also, the preoperative C1-INH concentration had a highly significant effect on time to recurrence of cancer (P = 0.0007), adjusting for age and disease extent. After surgery the mean IgG concentrations were within normal range and without difference between the two groups. On the other hand, the concentrations of C1-INH and C4 in the individual patients in both groups remained the same from before to after surgery and throughout the observation period (P = 0.34). Apparently, the serum levels of C1-INH and C4 do not reflect the bearing of cancer. We therefore suggest that these variables represent an independent immune state that is appropriate to the host. A comparison of our variables with those of healthy individuals seems to support this idea. This immune state has a significant influence on whether a resected gastric cancer will recur, and also on how soon recurrence may be manifest.\n\nAuthors: C. W. Janssen, R. T. Lie, C. F.

To test the hypothesis that the Bub2 pathway prevents premature actin ring assembly, we compared the timing of actin ring formation in wild type,  bub2\u0394 mad2\u0394 bub2\u0394mad2\u0394  bub2\u0394  mad2\u0394  bub2\u0394mad2\u0394  bfa1\u0394mad2\u0394  bub2\u0394  BFA1 Our data indicate that the Bub2 checkpoint pathway does not have a specific role in delaying actin ring formation.

          "An ultra-low-power image compressor for capsule endoscope\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy has been popularly applied for the diagnosis of diseases of the alimentary canal including Crohn's Disease, Celiac disease and other malabsorption disorders, benign and malignant tumors of the small intestine, vascular disorders and medication related small bowel injury. The wireless capsule endoscope has been successfully utilized to diagnose diseases of the small intestine and alleviate the discomfort and pain of patients. However, the resolution of demosaicked image is still low, and some interesting spots may be unintentionally omitted. Especially, the images will be severely distorted when physicians zoom images in for detailed diagnosis. Increasing resolution may cause significant power consumption in RF transmitter; hence, image compression is necessary for saving the power dissipation of RF transmitter. To overcome this drawback, we have been developing a new capsule endoscope, called GICam. We developed an ultra-low-power image compression processor for capsule endoscope or swallowable imaging capsules. In applications of capsule endoscopy, it is imperative to consider battery life/performance trade-offs. Applying state-of-the-art video compression techniques may significantly reduce the image bit rate by their high compression ratio, but they all require intensive computation and consume much battery power. There are many fast compression algorithms for reducing computation load; however, they may result in distortion of the original image, which is not good for use in the medical care. Thus, this paper will first simplify traditional video compression algorithms and propose a scalable compression architecture. As the result, the developed video compressor only costs 31 K gates at 2 frames per second, consumes 14.92 mW, and reduces the video size by 75% at least.\n\nAuthors: Meng-Chun Lin, Lan-Rong Dung, Ping-Kuo Weng",
          "Chromosomal Aberrations in Lymphocytes of Healthy Subjects and Risk of Cancer\n\nThere is evidence that increased frequency of chromosomal aberration (CA) in peripheral blood lymphocytes is a predictor of cancer, but further data are needed to better characterize CA as marker of cancer risk. From the archives of 15 laboratories we gathered cytogenetic records of 11,834 subjects who were free of cancer at the moment of blood drawing and who underwent cytogenetic examination for preventive purposes in the Czech Republic during 1975\u20132000. We linked these records to the national cancer registry, revealing a total of 485 cancer cases. Subjects were classified according to the percentiles of CA distribution within each laboratory as low (0\u201333rd percentile), medium (34\u201366th percentile), and high (66\u2013100th percentile). Subjects were further classified by occupational exposure and by subclass of CA. We found a significant association between the overall cancer incidence and the presence of chromosome-type aberrations [relative risk (RR) for high vs. low CA level = 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03\u20131.50] but not chromatid-type aberrations. Stomach cancer showed a strong association with frequency of total CA (RR = 7.79; 95% CI, 1.01\u201360.0). The predictivity of CA observed in subjects exposed to various classes of carcinogens did not significantly differ from the group of nonexposed subjects. This study contributes to validation of CA as a predictive marker of cancer risk, in particular, of stomach cancer; the association between CA frequency and cancer risk might be limited to chromosome-type aberrations.\n\nAuthors: Pavel Rossner, Paolo Boffetta, Marcello Ceppi, Stefano Bonassi, Zdenek Smerhovsky, Karel Landa, Dagmar Juzova, Radim J. \u0160r\u00e1m\n\nKeywords: cancer risk, chromosomal aberrations, cohort study, cytogenetic assay, molecular epidemiology",

          "Anatomical Alterations of the Visual Motion Processing Network in Migraine with and without Aura\n\nPatients suffering from migraine with aura (MWA) and migraine without aura (MWoA) show abnormalities in visual motion perception during and between attacks. Whether this represents the consequences of structural changes in motion-processing networks in migraineurs is unknown. Moreover, the diagnosis of migraine relies on patient's history, and finding differences in the brain of migraineurs might help to contribute to basic research aimed at better understanding the pathophysiology of migraine. To investigate a common potential anatomical basis for these disturbances, we used high-resolution cortical thickness measurement and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine the motion-processing network in 24 migraine patients (12 with MWA and 12 MWoA) and 15 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). We found increased cortical thickness of motion-processing visual areas MT+ and V3A in migraineurs compared to HCs. Cortical thickness increases were accompanied by abnormalities of the subjacent white matter. In addition, DTI revealed that migraineurs have alterations in superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate nucleus, which are also involved in visual processing. A structural abnormality in the network of motion-processing areas could account for, or be the result of, the cortical hyperexcitability observed in migraineurs. The finding in patients with both MWA and MWoA of thickness abnormalities in area V3A, previously described as a source in spreading changes involved in visual aura, raises the question as to whether a \u201csilent\u201d cortical spreading depression develops as well in MWoA. In addition, these experimental data may provide clinicians and researchers with a noninvasively acquirable migraine biomarker.\n\nAuthors: Cristina Granziera, Alexandre F.

          "Improving organisational systems for diabetes care in Australian Indigenous communities\n\nIndigenous Australians experience disproportionately high prevalence of, and morbidity and mortality from diabetes. There is an urgent need to understand how Indigenous primary care systems are organised to deliver diabetes services to those most in need, to monitor the quality of diabetes care received by Indigenous people, and to improve systems for better diabetes care. The intervention featured two annual cycles of assessment, feedback workshops, action planning, and implementation of system changes in 12 Indigenous community health centres. Assessment included a structured review of health service systems and audit of clinical records. Main process of care measures included adherence to guideline-scheduled services and medication adjustment. Main patient outcome measures were HbA1c, blood pressure and total cholesterol levels. There was good engagement of health centre staff, with significant improvements in system development over the study period. Adherence to guideline-scheduled processes improved, including increases in 6 monthly testing of HbA1c from 41% to 74% (Risk ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.71\u20132.10), 3 monthly checking of blood pressure from 63% to 76% (1.27, 1.13\u20131.37), annual testing of total cholesterol from 56% to 74% (1.36, 1.20\u20131.49), biennial eye checking by a ophthalmologist from 34% to 54% (1.68, 1.39\u20131.95), and 3 monthly feet checking from 20% to 58% (3.01, 2.52\u20133.47). Medication adjustment rates following identification of elevated HbA1c and blood pressure were low, increasing from 10% to 24%, and from 13% to 21% respectively at year 1 audit. However, improvements in medication adjustment were not maintained at the year 2 follow-up. Mean HbA1c value improved from 9.3 to 8.9% (mean difference -0.4%, 95% CI -0.7;-0.1), but there was no improvement in blood pressure or cholesterol control. This quality improvement (QI) intervention has proved to be highly acceptable in the Indigenous Australian primary care setting and has been associated with significant improvements in systems and processes of care and some intermediate outcomes. However, improvements appear to be limited by inadequate attention to abnormal clinical findings and medication management. Greater improvement in intermediate outcomes may be achieved by specifically addressing system barriers to therapy intensification through more effective engagement of medical staff in QI activities and/or greater use of nurse-practitioners.\n\nAuthors: Ross Bailie, Damin Si, Michelle Dowden, Lynette O'Donoghue, Christine Connors, Gary Robinson, Joan Cunningham, Tarun Weeramanthri"

          "When is a drug-related death not a drug-related death? Implications for current drug-related death policies in the UK and Europe\n\nDrug-related death (DRD) figures, published by the national performance management framework, are used to monitor the performance of Drug (and Alcohol) Action Teams (D[A]ATs) in England and Wales with respect to reducing DRDs among drug abusers. To date, no investigation has been made into the types of death included in these figures, the demographic and drug profile of those who died, nor the likelihood of individuals included in DRD figures interacting with services designed to assist drug abusers. The aim of this work was to examine the characteristics of deaths classified as drug-related and to explore their applicability to performance-monitor drug-related services. Liverpool was chosen because it was reported by the national DRD monitoring system to have the highest number of DRDs in 2004. Information was retrieved from the Liverpool coroner's records and established monitoring systems on individuals reported by the national performance monitoring system as a DRD between 1 Non-drug abusers were significantly older (median age 53.59 vs. 38.23), had no recent contact with drug-related agencies (cv. 31.6% of abusers who had treatment contact) and had different post mortem drug profiles than drug abusers. A significantly greater proportion of non-drug abusers died from drug toxicity \u2013 predominantly through anti-depressants, anti-psychotics and analgesics. Our findings suggest that the national DRD performance monitoring system includes deaths of people who are not drug abusers \u2013 individuals who are not the current focus of drug prevention, treatment or harm minimisation services. This raises concerns regarding the applicability of these figures to performance monitor D(A)ATs. Furthermore, using the more compact definitions used to monitor trends in DRDs across England, Wales and Europe fails to include a proportion of deaths attributable to drug misuse \u2013 such as those attributable blood-borne viruses. Current definitions used to monitor DRDs locally, nationally and across Europe fail to capture the true burden of drug-related mortality.\n\nAuthors: Caryl M Beynon, Mark A Bellis, Elaine Church, Sue Neely",

The conventional conditions were modified by factors that enhanced colony formation of 3 or more of these cell lines. The modified culture conditions were then applied to the growth in agar of primary breast tumours. A 5-fold improvement in plating efficiency was observed when cultures of 105 primary tumours grown under these modified conditions were compared to those of 52 tumours grown earlier under conventional conditions, and a 4-fold improvement resulted from the addition of hormones and conditioned medidum in 26 tumours cultured simultaneously under both conditions. The biologic relevance of these clonogens recovered in vitro was substantiated by a 70% concordance of in vitro and in vivo tumour sensitivity to anticancer drugs.\n\nAuthors: V. Hug, M. Haynes, R.

          "Resident-generated versus instructor-generated cases in ethics and professionalism training\n\nThe emphasis on ethics and professionalism in medical education continues to increase. Indeed, in the United States the ACGME will require residency programs to include professionalism training in all curricula by 2007. Most courses focus on cases generated by the course instructors rather than on cases generated by the trainees. To date, however, there has been no assessment of the utility of these two case discussion formats. In order to determine the utility of instructor-generated cases (IGCs) versus resident-generated cases (RGCs) in ethics and professionalism training, the author developed an innovative course that included both case formats. The IGCs were landmark cases and cases from the experience of the course instructors, while the RGCs were selected by the residents themselves. Residents were then surveyed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each format. Of twenty-two second and third year residents, fourteen completed surveys (response rate 64%). Residents were nearly evenly split in preferring RGCs (38%), IGCs (31%), or not preferring one to the other (31%). 29% stated that they learn more from the RGCs, 21% stated that they learn more from the IGCs, and 50% stated that they did not find a difference in their learning based on format. In general, residents surveyed prefer a mix of formats. Residents tended to find the RGCs more relevant and interesting, and felt the IGCs were necessary to ensure adequate breadth of cases and concepts. Based on our relatively small sample at a single institution, we believe that educators should consider incorporating both instructor-generated and resident-generated cases in their ethics and professionalism curricula, and should evaluate the utility of such a model at their own institution. Further work is needed to illuminate other potential improvements in ethics and professionalism education.\n\nAuthors: Alexander A Kon",

          "Rapid detection of allele loss in colorectal tumours using microsatellites and fluorescent DNA technology.\n\nIn order to investigate allele loss in colorectal tumours we have developed a rapid technique which overcomes most of the problems associated with radioactive Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of allele loss. We utilise microsatellite length polymorphisms which are highly informative and are closely linked to loci of interest. Sequences containing microsatellites can be amplified from normal and tumour DNA pairs by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in which one of the primers is fluorescently labelled. This enables us to detect the products on polyacrylamide gels run on an automated DNA sequencer using dedicated software, by which results are automatically quantitated in terms of peak size, height, and area. Using this technique we have analysed 26 normal tissue: cancer pairs for allele loss at two loci linked to the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene on chromosome 5q. Repeated assays yielded identical results for each pair. Allele loss was found in 10 out of 25 informative samples (40%).\n\nAuthors: L. Cawkwell, S. M. Bell, F. A. Lewis, M. F. Dixon, G. R.

In normal breast tissues, the c-kit proto-oncogene product was strongly expressed on cell membrane and/or cytoplasm of alveolar and ductal cells. The immunoreactive score (IRS) of c-kit proto-oncogene product in normal mammary epithelia was 6.22 +/- 2.11 (mean +/- s.d.). In benign breast diseases, the c-kit proto-oncogene product was detected heterogeneously with a reduced IRS (3.33 +/- 2.44). In breast cancer tissues, the expression of the immunoreactive c-kit proto-oncogene product was often deleted and the average IRS was significantly reduced compared to those of normal breast tissues or benign breast diseases tissues. Among benign diseases, the average IRS of intraductal papilloma was significantly reduced (1.34 +/- 1.70) and the staining intensity and pattern were found to be similar to those seen in breast cancer. The results in this study suggested that the c-kit proto-oncogene product is correlated with the growth control or the differentiation of normal breast epithelium. Also, the loss of the expression of this protein may indicate the change of the signal transduction in relation to malignant transformation in human mammary epithelium.\n\nAuthors: X. Chui, H.

          "Automated Quality Assurance of Online NIR Analysers\n\nModern NIR analysers produce valuable data for closed-loop process control and optimisation practically in real time. Thus it is highly important to keep them in the best possible shape. Quality assurance (QA) of NIR analysers is an interesting and complex issue because it is not only the instrument and sample handling that has to be monitored. At the same time, validity of prediction models has to be assured. A system for fully automated QA of NIR analysers is described. The system takes care of collecting and organising spectra from various instruments, relevant laboratory, and process management system (PMS) data. Validation of spectra is based on simple diagnostics values derived from the spectra. Predictions are validated against laboratory (LIMS) or other online analyser results (collected from PMS). The system features automated alarming, reporting, trending, and charting functions for major key variables for easy visual inspection. Various textual and graphical reports are sent to maintenance people through email. The software was written with Borland Delphi 7 Enterprise. Oracle and PMS ODBC interfaces were used for accessing LIMS and PMS data using appropriate SQL queries. It will be shown that it is possible to take actions even before the quality of predictions is seriously affected, thus maximising the overall uptime of the instrument.\n\nAuthors: Kari Aaljoki",

Thorough and systematic evaluation of these patients can be highly rewarding in terms of optimizing patient outcome. We report the case of a 45-year-old woman whose initial presentation was with acute onset of confusion, memory loss with personality change and headaches. A differential diagnosis of systemic illness and cerebral pathology was entertained. She was empirically treated for neurological infection. Brain imaging revealed bilateral thalamic and cerebellar infarction. Further evaluation with an aim to define the etiology, revealed the diagnosis of Patent Foramen Ovale with paradoxical embolism. The differential diagnosis of unexplained rapid onset of confusion, amnesia with minimal motor neurological deficits and relevant appropriate investigations are discussed in this case report.

Considering the effects of PPAR ligands on critical aspects of systemic physiology, including obesity, lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and diabetes, gene knockout (KO) in mice is the ideal platform for both hypothesis testing and discovery of new PPAR functions in vivo. With the fervent pursuit of the magic bullet to eradicate the obesity epidemic, special emphasis has been placed on the impacts of PPARs on obesity and its associated diseases. As detailed in this review, understanding how PPARs regulate gene expression and basic metabolic pathways is a necessary intermediate en route to deciphering their effects on obesity. Over a decade and dozens of genetic modifications of PPARs into this effort, valuable lessons have been learned, but we are left with more questions to be answered. These lessons and future prospects are the subject of this review.\n\nAuthors: Yaacov Barak, Suyeon Kim",
          "Rac inhibits thrombin-induced Rho activation: evidence of a Pak-dependent GTPase crosstalk\n\nThe strict spatio-temporal control of Rho GTPases is critical for many cellular functions, including cell motility, contractility, and growth. In this regard, the prototypical Rho family GTPases, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 regulate the activity of each other by a still poorly understood mechanism. Indeed, we found that constitutively active forms of Rac inhibit stress fiber formation and Rho stimulation by thrombin. Surprisingly, a mutant of Rac that is unable to activate Pak1 failed to inhibit thrombin signaling to Rho. To explore the underlying mechanism, we investigated whether Pak1 could regulate guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho. We found that Pak1 associates with P115-RhoGEF but not with PDZ-RhoGEF or LARG, and knock down experiments revealed that P115-RhoGEF plays a major role in signaling from thrombin receptors to Rho in HEK293T cells. Pak1 binds the DH-PH domain of P115-RhoGEF, thus suggesting a mechanism by which Rac stimulation of Pak1 may disrupt receptor-dependent Rho signaling. In agreement, expression of a dominant-negative Pak-Inhibitory Domain potentiated the activation of Rho by thrombin, and prevented the inhibition of Rho by Rac. These findings indicate that Rac interferes with receptor-dependent Rho stimulation through Pak1, thus providing a mechanism for cross-talk between these two small-GTPases.\n\nAuthors: Hans Rosenfeldt, Maria Domenica Castellone, Paul A Randazzo, J Silvio Gutkind",

          "The Use of the Cancellation Technique to Quantify the Hermann Grid Illusion\n\nWhen observers view a grid of mid-gray lines superimposed on a black background, they report seeing illusory dark gray smudges at the grid intersections, an effect known as the Hermann grid illusion. The strength of the illusion is often measured using the cancellation technique: A white disk is placed over one of these intersections and the luminance of the disk is reduced until the disk disappears. Its luminance at this point, i.e., the disk's detection threshold, is taken to be a measure of the strength of the illusion. Our experiments showed that some distortions of the Hermann grid, which were sufficient to completely disrupt the illusion, did not reduce the disk's detection threshold. This showed that the cancellation technique is not a valid method for measuring the strength of the Hermann grid illusion. Those studies that attempted to use this technique inadvertently studied a different effect known as the blanking phenomenon. We conclude by presenting an explanation for the latter effect.\n\nAuthors: Piers D.L. Howe, Margaret S. Livingstone",
          "The effect of Warfarin and factor VII on tissue procoagulant activity and pulmonary seeding.\n\nPeri-tumour fibrin is a consistent feature of tumour stroma and is deposited shortly after tumour cell inoculation. Since there are several ways in which fibrin may be beneficial to tumour growth, it is possible that the ability of normal or malignant tissue to generate fibrin may influence metastasis. Many normal tissues and tumour cells possess a procoagulant activity that is due to a complex of tissue factor and factor VII. We have measured this tissue procoagulant activity in normal rats, rats stabilised on Warfarin and similarly anticoagulated animals injected with factor VII. The effect of Warfarin and factor VII administration on pulmonary seeding following injection of MC28 fibrosarcoma cells was also assessed. Procoagulant activity in adrenal, lung and colon was significantly reduced by Warfarin (P less than 0.001). Administration of factor VII significantly increased lung and adrenal tissue procoagulant activity in anticoagulated rats (P less than 0.02). Warfarinised rats had significantly slower primary tumour growth (P less than 0.001) and fewer lung deposits than control animals (P less than 0.001). Injection of factor VII restored pulmonary seeding to control levels (P less than 0.001). Warfarin did not affect the ability of the cells to adhere in vitro and did not reduce the number of tumour cells physically trapped in the lungs after intravenous injection. It is concluded that the procoagulant activity of normal tissues may influence their ability to support tumour growth and that the antimetastatic effect of Warfarin may be at least partly due to a reduction in the availability of the factor VII required for this activity.\n\nAuthors: J.

          "SVRMHC prediction server for MHC-binding peptides\n\nThe binding between antigenic peptides (epitopes) and the MHC molecule is a key step in the cellular immune response. Accurate  in silico  Recently, we demonstrated the appealing performance of SVRMHC, an SVR-based quantitative modeling method for peptide-MHC interactions, when applied to three mouse class I MHC molecules. Subsequently, we have greatly extended the construction of SVRMHC models and have established such models for more than 40 class I and class II MHC molecules. Here we present the SVRMHC web server for predicting peptide-MHC binding affinities using these models. Benchmarked percentile scores are provided for all predictions. The larger number of SVRMHC models available allowed for an updated evaluation of the performance of the SVRMHC method compared to other well- known linear modeling methods. SVRMHC is an accurate and easy-to-use prediction server for epitope-MHC binding with significant coverage of MHC molecules. We believe it will prove to be a valuable resource for T cell epitope researchers.\n\nAuthors: Ji Wan, Wen Liu, Qiqi Xu, Yongliang Ren, Darren R Flower, Tongbin Li",
          "Homosexual Women Have Less Grey Matter in Perirhinal Cortex than Heterosexual Women\n\nIs sexual orientation associated with structural differences in the brain? To address this question, 80 homosexual and heterosexual men and women (16 homosexual men and 15 homosexual women) underwent structural MRI. We used voxel-based morphometry to test for differences in grey matter concentration associated with gender and sexual orientation. Compared with heterosexual women, homosexual women displayed less grey matter bilaterally in the temporo-basal cortex, ventral cerebellum, and left ventral premotor cortex. The relative decrease in grey matter was most prominent in the left perirhinal cortex. The left perirhinal area also showed less grey matter in heterosexual men than in heterosexual women. Thus, in homosexual women, the perirhinal cortex grey matter displayed a more male-like structural pattern. This is in accordance with previous research that revealed signs of sex-atypical prenatal androgenization in homosexual women, but not in homosexual men. The relevance of the perirhinal area for high order multimodal (olfactory and visual) object, social, and sexual processing is discussed.\n\nAuthors: Jorge Ponseti, Hartwig R.

          "Identification of a subpopulation of MeCCNU resistant cells in previously untreated Lewis lung tumours.\n\nA variety of experimental endpoints including excision cell survival, lung colony curability, tumour regrowth delay and i.m. tumour curability following MeCCNU alone and combined with gamma-radiation, were used to define the MeCCNU cell survival curve down to \"tumour cure\" level in previously untreated i.m. Lewis lung tumours. The survival curve was found to be biphasic, the tumour cells being markedly resistant to MeCCNU at high doses of the drug. Below 10 mg kg-1 the survival curve was exponential through the origin with a D10 of approximately 2 mg kg-1, while above 15 mg kg-1 the D10 was approximately 25 mg kg-1. From linear extrapolation of the terminal part of the cell survival curve to zero drug dose, it appeared that about 1 in 10(5) (or 0.001%) of tumour cells were resistant to MeCCNU.\n\nAuthors: T. C.

          "Variation in the survival of women with breast cancer in Scotland. The Scottish Breast Cancer Focus Group and The Scottish Cancer Therapy Network.\n\nWe have investigated factors influencing the survival of women with early breast cancer in Scotland. In a retrospective study, clinical, treatment and 'service' factors, e.g. surgical case load, deprivation and geographical area (health board of first treatment) were recorded from hospital records. A total of 2148 women with invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 1987 were identified from the Scottish Cancer Registry, of whom 1619 without metastases at diagnosis underwent surgery as part of their primary treatment. In a multivariate analysis, clinical factors (age, clinical stage, pathological tumour size, node status and oestrogen receptor status) all influenced survival. After allowing for these clinical factors, surgical case load and deprivation did not have statistically significant effects on survival. By contrast, health board did affect survival. This was explained in part by the selection of patients for surgery. There appeared, however, to be a residual effect that may be related to differences in the use of adjuvant systemic treatment among the different health boards. We conclude that, in Scotland, geographical variation in both surgical and non-surgical treatment has a greater effect on variability in survival for women with breast cancer than surgical case load and deprivation.\n\nAuthors: C.

          "A mid year comparison study of career satisfaction and emotional states between residents and faculty at one academic medical center\n\nThe Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's (ACGME) new requirements raise multiple challenges for academic medical centers. We sought to evaluate career satisfaction, emotional states, positive and negative experiences, work hours and sleep among residents and faculty simultaneously in one academic medical center after implementation of the ACGME duty hour requirements. Residents and faculty (1330) in the academic health center were asked to participate in a confidential survey; 72% of the residents and 66% of the faculty completed the survey. Compared to residents, faculty had higher levels of satisfaction with career choice, competence, importance and usefulness; lower levels of anxiousness and depression. The most positive experiences for both groups corresponded to strong interpersonal relationships and educational value; most negative experiences to poor interpersonal relationships and issues perceived outside of the physician's control. Approximately 13% of the residents and 14% of the faculty were out of compliance with duty hour requirements. Nearly 5% of faculty reported working more than 100 hours per week. For faculty who worked 24 hour shifts, nearly 60% were out of compliance with the duty-hour requirements. Reasons for increased satisfaction with career choice, positive emotional states and experiences for faculty compared to residents are unexplained. Earlier studies from this institution identified similar positive findings among advanced residents compared to more junior residents. Faculty are more frequently at risk for duty-hour violations. If patient safety is of prime importance, faculty, in particular, should be compliant with the duty hour requirements. Perhaps the ACGME should contain faculty work hours as part of its regulatory function.\n\nAuthors: Donald E Girard, Dongseok Choi, Jamie Dickey, Kristen Wessel, Donald Austin",
          "A high-throughput method for detection of DNA in chloroplasts using flow cytometry\n\nThe amount of DNA in the chloroplasts of some plant species has been shown recently to decline dramatically during leaf development. A high-throughput method of DNA detection in chloroplasts is now needed in order to facilitate the further investigation of this process using large numbers of tissue samples. The DNA-binding fluorophores 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), SYBR Green I (SG), SYTO 42, and SYTO 45 were assessed for their utility in flow cytometric analysis of DNA in Arabidopsis chloroplasts. Fluorescence microscopy and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) were used to validate flow cytometry data. We found neither DAPI nor SYTO 45 suitable for flow cytometric analysis of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) content, but did find changes in cpDNA content during development by flow cytometry using SG and SYTO 42. The latter dye provided more sensitive detection, and the results were similar to those from the fluorescence microscopic analysis. Differences in SYTO 42 fluorescence were found to correlate with differences in cpDNA content as determined by qPCR using three primer sets widely spaced across the chloroplast genome, suggesting that the whole genome undergoes copy number reduction during development, rather than selective reduction/degradation of subgenomic regions. Flow cytometric analysis of chloroplasts stained with SYTO 42 is a high-throughput method suitable for determining changes in cpDNA content during development and for sorting chloroplasts on the basis of DNA content.\n\nAuthors: Beth A Rowan, Delene J Oldenburg, Arnold J Bendich",
          "Schedule-selective biochemical modulation of 5-fluorouracil in advanced colorectal cancer: a multicentric phase II study.\n\nWe have recently reported high clinical activity against advanced colorectal cancer of a regimen-alternating bolus FUra, modulated by methotrexate (MTX), and continuous infusion FUra, modulated by 6-s-leucovorin (6-s-LV). Considering the low toxicity of the bolus part of this regimen and our recent in vitro finding of a strong synergism between bolus FUra and natural-beta-IFN (n-beta-IFN), this cytokine was incorporated in the bolus part of our treatment programme. Fifty-six patients with untreated, advanced, measurable colorectal cancer were treated with two biweekly cycles of FUra bolus (600 mg m(-2)), modulated by MTX (24 h earlier, 200 mg m(-2)), and n-beta-IFN (3 x 10(6) IU i.m. every 12 h, starting at the time of FUra administration for four doses), alternating with a 3-week continuous infusion of FUra (200 mg m(-2) daily), modulated by 6-s-LV (20 mg m(-2) weekly bolus). After a 1-week rest, the whole cycle (8 weeks) was repeated if indicated. A total of 5 complete and 17 partial responses were obtained (response rate, 41%; 95% confidence limits, 28-55%) in 54 assessable patients. After a median follow-up time of 36 months, five patients are still alive. Overall, the median time to treatment failure was 6.4 months. The median duration of survival was 15.0 months. There was one treatment-related death after a course of MTX --> bolus FUra/n-beta-IFN and grade III-IV toxicity occurred in 18% of the patients. As the addition of n-beta-IFN results in high toxicity, whereas the efficacy seems to be similar to that of the same regimen without the cytokine, our groups are currently randomizing the original regimen, without IFN, against standard modulated bolus FUra.\n\nAuthors: C.

While condition-specific ICF Core Sets are useful, a Generic ICF Core Set is needed to describe and compare problems in functioning across health conditions. The aims of the multi-centre, cross-sectional study presented here were: a) to propose a method to select ICF categories when a large amount of ICF-based data have to be handled, and b) to identify candidate ICF categories for a Generic ICF Core Set by examining their explanatory power in relation to item one of the SF-36. The data were collected from 1039 patients using the ICF checklist, the SF-36 and a Comorbidity Questionnaire. ICF categories to be entered in an initial regression model were selected following systematic steps in accordance with the ICF structure. Based on an initial regression model, additional models were designed by systematically substituting the ICF categories included in it with ICF categories with which they were highly correlated.

          "A biological question and a balanced (orthogonal) design: the ingredients to efficiently analyze two-color microarrays with Confirmatory Factor Analysis\n\nFactor analysis (FA) has been widely applied in microarray studies as a data-reduction-tool without any a-priori assumption regarding associations between observed data and latent structure (Exploratory Factor Analysis). A disadvantage is that the representation of data in a reduced set of dimensions can be difficult to interpret, as biological contrasts do not necessarily coincide with single dimensions. However, FA can also be applied as an instrument to confirm what is expected on the basis of pre-established hypotheses (Confirmatory Factor Analysis, CFA). We show that with a hypothesis incorporated in a balanced (orthogonal) design, including 'SelfSelf' hybridizations, dye swaps and independent replications, FA can be used to identify the latent factors underlying the correlation structure among the observed two-color microarray data. An orthogonal design will reflect the principal components associated with each experimental factor. We applied CFA to a microarray study performed to investigate cisplatin resistance in four ovarian cancer cell lines, which only differ in their degree of cisplatin resistance. Two latent factors, coinciding with principal components, representing the differences in cisplatin resistance between the four ovarian cancer cell lines were easily identified. From these two factors 315 genes associated with cisplatin resistance were selected, 199 genes from the first factor (False Discovery Rate (FDR): 19%) and 152 (FDR: 24%) from the second factor, while both gene sets shared 36. The differential expression of 16 genes was validated with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Our results show that FA is an efficient method to analyze two-color microarray data provided that there is a pre-defined hypothesis reflected in an orthogonal design.\n\nAuthors: Anne PG Crijns, Frans Gerbens, A Edo D Plantinga, Gert Jan Meersma, Steven de Jong, Robert MW Hofstra, Elisabeth GE de Vries, Ate GJ van der Zee, Geertruida H de Bock, Gerard J te Meerman",

          "Comparative Analyses of Plant Transcription Factor Databases\n\nTranscription factors (TFs) are proteinaceous complex, which bind to the promoter regions in the DNA and affect transcription initiation. Plant TFs control gene expressions and genes control many physiological processes, which in turn trigger cascades of biochemical reactions in plant cells. The databases available for plant TFs are somewhat abundant but all convey different information and in different formats. Some of the publicly available plant TF databases may be narrow, while others are broad in scopes. For example, some of the best TF databases are ones that are very specific with just one plant species, but there are also other databases that contain a total of up to 20 different plant species. In this review plant TF databases ranging from a single species to many will be assessed and described. The comparative analyses of all the databases and their advantages and disadvantages are also discussed.\n\nAuthors: Silvia R Ramirez, Chhandak Basu\n\nKeywords: Plant transcription factor databases, bioinformatics.",
          "Recombination Difference between Sexes: A Role for Haploid Selection\n\nWhy the autosomal recombination rate differs between female and male meiosis in most species has been a genetic enigma since the early study of meiosis. Some hypotheses have been put forward to explain this widespread phenomenon and, up to now, only one fact has emerged clearly: In species in which meiosis is achiasmate in one sex, it is the heterogametic one. This pattern, known as the Haldane-Huxley rule, is thought to be a side effect, on autosomes, of the suppression of recombination between the sex chromosomes. However, this rule does not hold for heterochiasmate species (i.e., species in which recombination is present in both sexes but varies quantitatively between sexes) and does not apply to species lacking sex chromosomes, such as hermaphroditic plants. In this paper, we show that in plants, heterochiasmy is due to a male-female difference in gametic selection and is not influenced by the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This finding provides strong empirical support in favour of a population genetic explanation for the evolution of heterochiasmy and, more broadly, for the evolution of sex and recombination.\n\nAuthors: Thomas Lenormand, Julien Dutheil",
          "Down-Regulation of Platelet Surface CD47 Expression in \n\nPlatelet depletion is a key feature of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) caused by Shiga toxin-producing  Escherichia coli Here we demonstrated for the first time that platelet surface expression of CD47 was significantly decreased in C57BL6 mice treated with concentrated culture filtrates (CCF) from STEC O157:H7. STEC O157:H7 CCF treatment also led to a sharp drop of platelet counts. The reduction of cell surface CD47 was specific for platelets but not for neutrophil, monocytes and red blood cells. Down-regulation of platelet surface CD47 was also observed in isolated human platelets treated with O157:H7 CCF. Platelet surface CD47 reduction by O157:H7 CCF could be blocked by anti-TLR4 antibody but not anti-CD62 antibody. Down-regulation of platelet surface CD47 was positively correlated with platelet activation and phagocytosis by human monocyte-derived macrophages. Furthermore, the enhanced phagocytosis process of O157:H7 CCF-treated platelets was abolished by addition of soluble CD47 recombinants. Our results suggest that platelet CD47 down-regulation may be a novel mechanism underneath STEC-induced platelet depletion, and that the interactions between CD47 and its receptor, signal regulatory protein \u03b1 (SIRP\u03b1), play an essential role in modulating platelet homeostasis.\n\nAuthors: Ya-Lan Guo, Dan-Qing Liu, Zhen Bian, Chen-Yu Zhang, Ke Zen"

          "Functional correlates of Apolipoprotein E genotype in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration\n\nIt has been recently demonstrated that in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) memory deficits at presentation are commoner than previously thought. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype, the major genetic risk factor in sporadic late-onset Alzheimer Disease (AD), modulates cerebral perfusion in late middle-age cognitively normal subjects. ApoE \u03b54 homozygous have reduced glucose metabolism in the same regions involved in AD. The aim of this study was to determine whether ApoE genotype might play a key-role in influencing the cerebral functional pattern as well as the degree of memory deficits in FTLD patients. Fifty-two unrelated FTLD patients entered the study and underwent a somatic and neurological evaluation, laboratory examinations, a brain structural imaging study, and a brain functional Single Photon Emission Tomography study. ApoE genotype was determined. ApoE genotype influenced both clinical and functional features in FTLD. ApoE \u03b54-carriers were more impaired in long-term memory function (ApoE \u03b54 vs. ApoE non \u03b54, 6.3 \u00b1 3.9 vs. 10.1 \u00b1 4.2, p = 0.004) and more hypoperfused in uncus and parahippocampal regions (x,y,z = 38,-6,-20, T = 2.82, cluster size = 100 voxels; -32,-12,-28, T= 2.77, cluster size = 40 voxels). The present findings support the view that ApoE genotype might be considered a disease-modifying factor in FTLD, thus contributing to define a specific clinical presentation, and might be of relevance for pharmacological approaches.\n\nAuthors: Barbara Borroni, Daniela Perani, Silvana Archetti, Chiara Agosti, Barbara Paghera, Giuseppe Bellelli, Monica Di Luca, Alessandro Padovani",

          "Glomerular filtration rate, 131I-hippuran clearance and estimated creatinine clearance in cancer patients.\n\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR), 131I-Hippuran clearance and estimated creatinine clearance were investigated in 34 patients with cancer. For Hippuran clearance and GFR, analysed with the X-ray contrast (iohexol) and fluorescence technique, the least square linear regression coefficient was 5.01 +/- 0.41 (r = 0.91). This value concurs with the five to one ratio between GFR and renal plasma flow known from normal physiology and supports that Hippuran clearance is a valid measure of renal function. When the individual values of Hippuran clearance were divided by 5.01, the mean difference between the methods was 0.4 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 with standard deviation 13.4 ml min-1 1.73 m-2. The lower and upper limits of agreement were -26.7 and 25.9 ml min-1 1.73 m-2, respectively. Comparing creatinine clearance estimated from the serum creatinine level with GFR, the limits of agreement were -29.4 and 21.6 ml min-1 1.73 m-2.

          "Hypoxia-activated genes from early placenta are elevated in Preeclampsia, but not in Intra-Uterine Growth Retardation\n\nAs a first step to explore the possible relationships existing between the effects of low oxygen pressure in the first trimester placenta and placental pathologies developing from mid-gestation, two subtracted libraries totaling 2304 cDNA clones were constructed. For achieving this, two reciprocal suppressive/subtractive hybridization procedures (SSH) were applied to early (11 weeks) human placental villi after incubation either in normoxic or in hypoxic conditions. The clones from both libraries (1440 hypoxia-specific and 864 normoxia-specific) were spotted on nylon macroarrays. Complex cDNAs probes prepared from placental villi (either from early pregnancy, after hypoxic or normoxic culture conditions, or near term for controls or pathological placentas) were hybridized to the membranes. Three hundred and fifty nine clones presenting a hybridization signal above the background were sequenced and shown to correspond to 276 different genes. Nine of these genes are mitochondrial, while 267 are nuclear. Specific expression profiles characteristic of preeclampsia (PE) could be identified, as well as profiles specific of intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR). Focusing on the chromosomal distribution of the fraction of genes that responded in at least one hybridization experiment, we could observe a highly significant chromosomal clustering of 54 genes into 8 chromosomal regions, four of which containing imprinted genes. Comparative mapping data indicate that these imprinted clusters are maintained in synteny in mice, and apparently in cattle and pigs, suggesting that the maintenance of such syntenies is requested for achieving a normal placental physiology in eutherian mammals.

The goal of this study was twofold: (1) to evaluate age-related changes in what is exposed to ionizing radiation in the neck area, and (2) to assess thyroid shield presence in cephalometric radiographs Cephalometric radiographs at one academic setting were sampled and neck exposure was related to calendar year and patient's gender and age. In the absence of shields, children have more vertebrae exposed than adults (p < 0.0001) and females have more neck tissue exposed inferior to the hyoid bone than males (p < 0.0001). The hyoid bone-porion distance increased with age (p <0.01). Thyroid shields were visible in 19% of the radiographs and depended strongly on the calendar year during which patient was seen (p-value <0.0001).

DNA aneuploidy and above median (4.2%) SPF were both associated with high tumour grade, large size of prostate and presence of distant metastases. Both aneuploidy and high SPF (greater than 4.2%) indicated short 10-year progression-free (P = 0.01 for ploidy and P = 0.0002 for SPF), overall (P = 0.004 and P less than 0.0001) as well as prostate cancer survival (P = 0.002 and P less than 0.0001). Ten-year overall survival rate was 45% in cases with SPF below 4.2% and 0% in those with higher values, whereas the corresponding prostate cancer-specific survival rates were 80% and 11%, respectively. None of the seven tumours with SPF above 12% showed an objective response to endocrine therapy, whereas 26/49 (52%) of those with lower SPF values responded (P = 0.01). DNA ploidy, tumour grade, T-stage or M-stage did not significantly correlate with endocrine responsiveness. SPF was also the best predictor of progression free survival in patients treated hormonally. In conclusion, detection of high SPF in prostate cancer may indicate lack of hormonal responsiveness and poor prognosis.\n\nAuthors: T. Visakorpi, O. P. Kallioniemi, I. Y. Paronen, J. J. Isola, A. I.

          "Quantitative prediction of mouse class I MHC peptide binding affinity using support vector machine regression (SVR) models\n\nThe binding between peptide epitopes and major histocompatibility complex proteins (MHCs) is an important event in the cellular immune response. Accurate prediction of the binding between short peptides and the MHC molecules has long been a principal challenge for immunoinformatics. Recently, the modeling of MHC-peptide binding has come to emphasize quantitative predictions: instead of categorizing peptides as \"binders\" or \"non-binders\" or as \"strong binders\" and \"weak binders\", recent methods seek to make predictions about precise binding affinities. We developed a quantitative support vector machine regression (SVR) approach, called SVRMHC, to model peptide-MHC binding affinities. As a non-linear method, SVRMHC was able to generate models that out-performed existing linear models, such as the \"additive method\". By adopting a new \"11-factor encoding\" scheme, SVRMHC takes into account similarities in the physicochemical properties of the amino acids constituting the input peptides. When applied to MHC-peptide binding data for three mouse class I MHC alleles, the SVRMHC models produced more accurate predictions than those produced previously. Furthermore, comparisons based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that SVRMHC was able to out-perform several prominent methods in identifying strongly binding peptides. As a method with demonstrated performance in the quantitative modeling of MHC-peptide binding and in identifying strong binders, SVRMHC is a promising immunoinformatics tool with not inconsiderable future potential.\n\nAuthors: Wen Liu, Xiangshan Meng, Qiqi Xu, Darren R Flower, Tongbin Li",

          "Social capital and health: Does egalitarianism matter? A literature review\n\nThe aim of the paper is to critically review the notion of social capital and review empirical literature on the association between social capital and health across countries. The methodology used for the review includes a systematic search on electronic databases for peer-reviewed published literature. We categorize studies according to level of analysis (single and multilevel) and examine whether studies reveal a significant health impact of individual and area level social capital. We compare the study conclusions according to the country's degrees of economic egalitarianism. Regardless of study design, our findings indicate that a positive association (fixed effect) exists between social capital and better health irrespective of countries degree of egalitarianism. However, we find that the between-area variance (random effect) in health tends to be lower in more egalitarian countries than in less egalitarian countries. Our tentative conclusion is that an association between social capital and health at the individual level is robust with respect to the degree of egalitarianism within a country. Area level or contextual social capital may be less salient in egalitarian countries in explaining health differences across places.\n\nAuthors: M Kamrul Islam, Juan Merlo, Ichiro Kawachi, Martin Lindstr\u00f6m, Ulf-G Gerdtham",

          "Circadian Remodeling of Neuronal Circuits Involved in Rhythmic Behavior\n\nClock output pathways are central to convey timing information from the circadian clock to a diversity of physiological systems, ranging from cell-autonomous processes to behavior. While the molecular mechanisms that generate and sustain rhythmicity at the cellular level are well understood, it is unclear how this information is further structured to control specific behavioral outputs. Rhythmic release of pigment dispersing factor (PDF) has been proposed to propagate the time of day information from core pacemaker cells to downstream targets underlying rhythmic locomotor activity. Indeed, such circadian changes in PDF intensity represent the only known mechanism through which the PDF circuit could communicate with its output. Here we describe a novel circadian phenomenon involving extensive remodeling in the axonal terminals of the PDF circuit, which display higher complexity during the day and significantly lower complexity at nighttime, both under daily cycles and constant conditions. In support to its circadian nature, cycling is lost in bona fide clockless mutants. We propose this clock-controlled structural plasticity as a candidate mechanism contributing to the transmission of the information downstream of pacemaker cells.\n\nAuthors: Mar\u00eda Paz Fern\u00e1ndez, Jimena Berni, Mar\u00eda Fernanda Ceriani",

          "Recent Origin and Cultural Reversion of a Hunter\u2013Gatherer Group\n\nContemporary hunter\u2013gatherer groups are often thought to serve as models of an ancient lifestyle that was typical of human populations prior to the development of agriculture. Patterns of genetic variation in hunter\u2013gatherer groups such as the !Kung and African Pygmies are consistent with this view, as they exhibit low genetic diversity coupled with high frequencies of divergent mtDNA types not found in surrounding agricultural groups, suggesting long-term isolation and small population sizes. We report here genetic evidence concerning the origins of the Mlabri, an enigmatic hunter\u2013gatherer group from northern Thailand. The Mlabri have no mtDNA diversity, and the genetic diversity at Y-chromosome and autosomal loci are also extraordinarily reduced in the Mlabri. Genetic, linguistic, and cultural data all suggest that the Mlabri were recently founded, 500\u2013800 y ago, from a very small number of individuals. Moreover, the Mlabri appear to have originated from an agricultural group and then adopted a hunting\u2013gathering subsistence mode. This example of cultural reversion from agriculture to a hunting\u2013gathering lifestyle indicates that contemporary hunter\u2013gatherer groups do not necessarily reflect a pre-agricultural lifestyle.\n\nAuthors: Hiroki Oota, Brigitte Pakendorf, Gunter Weiss, Arndt von Haeseler, Surin Pookajorn, Wannapa Settheetham-Ishida, Danai Tiwawech, Takafumi Ishida, Mark Stoneking",

A Number of methods have been developed to address this challenging task. These methods, however, either apply to specific subsets, or their predictions are not formalised, or they do not provide precise confidence values for their predictions. We recently established a learning system for automated annotation, trained with a broad variety of different organisms to predict the standardised annotation terms from Gene Ontology (GO). Now, this method has been made available to the public via our web-service GOPET (Gene Ontology term Prediction and Evaluation Tool). It supplies annotation for sequences of any organism. For each predicted term an appropriate confidence value is provided. The basic method had been developed for predicting molecular function GO-terms. It is now expanded to predict biological process terms. This web service is available via  Our web service gives experimental researchers as well as the bioinformatics community a valuable sequence annotation device. Additionally, GOPET also provides less significant annotation data which may serve as an extended discovery platform for the user.\n\nAuthors: Arunachalam Vinayagam, Coral del Val, Falk Schubert, Roland Eils, Karl-Heinz Glatting, S\u00e1ndor Suhai, Rainer K\u00f6nig",

We examined pH levels in EBC and capsaicin cough response in 13 patients with chronic cough (mean age 41 years, SD 9) associated with GOR before and after omeprazole treatment (40 mg/day for 14 days) and its relationship with clinical response. Omeprazole abolished symptoms associated with GOR. Patients with chronic cough had an EBC pH of 8.28 (SD 0.13) prior to treatment but this did not change with omeprazole treatment. There was a significant improvement in the Leicester Cough Questionnaire symptom scores from 80.8 points (SD 13.2) to 95.1 (SD 17) (p = 0.02) and in a 6-point scale of cough scores, but there was no change in capsaicin cough response.

          "Enhancement of in vitro prostaglandin E2 production by mouse fibrosarcoma cells after co-culture with various anti-tumour effector cells.\n\nWe have previously reported that an increase in the production of immunosuppressive prostaglandin E2 by a QR tumour (QR-32) is accompanied by progressive growth of the tumour in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. In order to determine what kinds of cell and factor(s) enable QR-32 cells to promote PGE2 production, we investigated the amounts of PGE2 in the supernatant of QR-32 cells by co-culturing them with various anti-tumour effector cells. Significantly high levels of PGE2 production were observed when the QR-32 cells were co-cultured with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, natural killer (NK) cells, polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes and streptococcal preparation (OK432)-activated or resident peritoneal macrophages (activated and resident macrophages). On the other hand, PGE2 production was not increased when QR-32 cells were co-cultured with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific to QR-32 cells. The high levels of PGE2 production were partially or totally inhibited by the presence of radical scavengers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and mannitol, although the cytotoxicity of LAK cells was not. We also exposed QR-32 cells to human recombinant cytokines and the growth factors which are produced when anti-tumour effector cells come in contact with tumour cells. Significant PGE2 production by QR-32 cells was observed when the cells were treated with interferon alpha (IFN-alpha), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) (all P < 0.001). These results suggest that oxygen radicals produced by anti-tumour effector cells and inflammatory cytokines provoke QR-32 cells to produce large amounts of immunosuppressive PGE2.\n\nAuthors: F.

          "An ultra-low-power image compressor for capsule endoscope\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy has been popularly applied for the diagnosis of diseases of the alimentary canal including Crohn's Disease, Celiac disease and other malabsorption disorders, benign and malignant tumors of the small intestine, vascular disorders and medication related small bowel injury. The wireless capsule endoscope has been successfully utilized to diagnose diseases of the small intestine and alleviate the discomfort and pain of patients. However, the resolution of demosaicked image is still low, and some interesting spots may be unintentionally omitted. Especially, the images will be severely distorted when physicians zoom images in for detailed diagnosis. Increasing resolution may cause significant power consumption in RF transmitter; hence, image compression is necessary for saving the power dissipation of RF transmitter. To overcome this drawback, we have been developing a new capsule endoscope, called GICam. We developed an ultra-low-power image compression processor for capsule endoscope or swallowable imaging capsules. In applications of capsule endoscopy, it is imperative to consider battery life/performance trade-offs. Applying state-of-the-art video compression techniques may significantly reduce the image bit rate by their high compression ratio, but they all require intensive computation and consume much battery power. There are many fast compression algorithms for reducing computation load; however, they may result in distortion of the original image, which is not good for use in the medical care. Thus, this paper will first simplify traditional video compression algorithms and propose a scalable compression architecture. As the result, the developed video compressor only costs 31 K gates at 2 frames per second, consumes 14.92 mW, and reduces the video size by 75% at least.\n\nAuthors: Meng-Chun Lin, Lan-Rong Dung, Ping-Kuo Weng"

The aim of this work was to examine the characteristics of deaths classified as drug-related and to explore their applicability to performance-monitor drug-related services.

Furthermore, using the more compact definitions used to monitor trends in DRDs across England, Wales and Europe fails to include a proportion of deaths attributable to drug misuse \u2013 such as those attributable blood-borne viruses.

          "Resident-generated versus instructor-generated cases in ethics and professionalism training\n\nThe emphasis on ethics and professionalism in medical education continues to increase. Indeed, in the United States the ACGME will require residency programs to include professionalism training in all curricula by 2007. Most courses focus on cases generated by the course instructors rather than on cases generated by the trainees. To date, however, there has been no assessment of the utility of these two case discussion formats. In order to determine the utility of instructor-generated cases (IGCs) versus resident-generated cases (RGCs) in ethics and professionalism training, the author developed an innovative course that included both case formats. The IGCs were landmark cases and cases from the experience of the course instructors, while the RGCs were selected by the residents themselves. Residents were then surveyed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each format. Of twenty-two second and third year residents, fourteen completed surveys (response rate 64%). Residents were nearly evenly split in preferring RGCs (38%), IGCs (31%), or not preferring one to the other (31%). 29% stated that they learn more from the RGCs, 21% stated that they learn more from the IGCs, and 50% stated that they did not find a difference in their learning based on format. In general, residents surveyed prefer a mix of formats. Residents tended to find the RGCs more relevant and interesting, and felt the IGCs were necessary to ensure adequate breadth of cases and concepts. Based on our relatively small sample at a single institution, we believe that educators should consider incorporating both instructor-generated and resident-generated cases in their ethics and professionalism curricula, and should evaluate the utility of such a model at their own institution. Further work is needed to illuminate other potential improvements in ethics and professionalism education.\n\nAuthors: Alexander A Kon",

          "Recent Origin and Cultural Reversion of a Hunter\u2013Gatherer Group\n\nContemporary hunter\u2013gatherer groups are often thought to serve as models of an ancient lifestyle that was typical of human populations prior to the development of agriculture. Patterns of genetic variation in hunter\u2013gatherer groups such as the !Kung and African Pygmies are consistent with this view, as they exhibit low genetic diversity coupled with high frequencies of divergent mtDNA types not found in surrounding agricultural groups, suggesting long-term isolation and small population sizes. We report here genetic evidence concerning the origins of the Mlabri, an enigmatic hunter\u2013gatherer group from northern Thailand. The Mlabri have no mtDNA diversity, and the genetic diversity at Y-chromosome and autosomal loci are also extraordinarily reduced in the Mlabri. Genetic, linguistic, and cultural data all suggest that the Mlabri were recently founded, 500\u2013800 y ago, from a very small number of individuals. Moreover, the Mlabri appear to have originated from an agricultural group and then adopted a hunting\u2013gathering subsistence mode. This example of cultural reversion from agriculture to a hunting\u2013gathering lifestyle indicates that contemporary hunter\u2013gatherer groups do not necessarily reflect a pre-agricultural lifestyle.\n\nAuthors: Hiroki Oota, Brigitte Pakendorf, Gunter Weiss, Arndt von Haeseler, Surin Pookajorn, Wannapa Settheetham-Ishida, Danai Tiwawech, Takafumi Ishida, Mark Stoneking",
          "Rapid detection of allele loss in colorectal tumours using microsatellites and fluorescent DNA technology.\n\nIn order to investigate allele loss in colorectal tumours we have developed a rapid technique which overcomes most of the problems associated with radioactive Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of allele loss. We utilise microsatellite length polymorphisms which are highly informative and are closely linked to loci of interest. Sequences containing microsatellites can be amplified from normal and tumour DNA pairs by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in which one of the primers is fluorescently labelled. This enables us to detect the products on polyacrylamide gels run on an automated DNA sequencer using dedicated software, by which results are automatically quantitated in terms of peak size, height, and area. Using this technique we have analysed 26 normal tissue: cancer pairs for allele loss at two loci linked to the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene on chromosome 5q. Repeated assays yielded identical results for each pair. Allele loss was found in 10 out of 25 informative samples (40%).\n\nAuthors: L. Cawkwell, S. M. Bell, F. A. Lewis, M. F. Dixon, G. R.

In normal breast tissues, the c-kit proto-oncogene product was strongly expressed on cell membrane and/or cytoplasm of alveolar and ductal cells. The immunoreactive score (IRS) of c-kit proto-oncogene product in normal mammary epithelia was 6.22 +/- 2.11 (mean +/- s.d.). In benign breast diseases, the c-kit proto-oncogene product was detected heterogeneously with a reduced IRS (3.33 +/- 2.44). In breast cancer tissues, the expression of the immunoreactive c-kit proto-oncogene product was often deleted and the average IRS was significantly reduced compared to those of normal breast tissues or benign breast diseases tissues. Among benign diseases, the average IRS of intraductal papilloma was significantly reduced (1.34 +/- 1.70) and the staining intensity and pattern were found to be similar to those seen in breast cancer. The results in this study suggested that the c-kit proto-oncogene product is correlated with the growth control or the differentiation of normal breast epithelium. Also, the loss of the expression of this protein may indicate the change of the signal transduction in relation to malignant transformation in human mammary epithelium.\n\nAuthors: X. Chui, H.

          "Highly Nonrandom Features of Synaptic Connectivity in Local Cortical Circuits\n\nHow different is local cortical circuitry from a random network? To answer this question, we probed synaptic connections with several hundred simultaneous quadruple whole-cell recordings from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat visual cortex. Analysis of this dataset revealed several nonrandom features in synaptic connectivity. We confirmed previous reports that bidirectional connections are more common than expected in a random network. We found that several highly clustered three-neuron connectivity patterns are overrepresented, suggesting that connections tend to cluster together. We also analyzed synaptic connection strength as defined by the peak excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude. We found that the distribution of synaptic connection strength differs significantly from the Poisson distribution and can be fitted by a lognormal distribution. Such a distribution has a heavier tail and implies that synaptic weight is concentrated among few synaptic connections. In addition, the strengths of synaptic connections sharing pre- or postsynaptic neurons are correlated, implying that strong connections are even more clustered than the weak ones. Therefore, the local cortical network structure can be viewed as a skeleton of stronger connections in a sea of weaker ones. Such a skeleton is likely to play an important role in network dynamics and should be investigated further.\n\nAuthors: Sen Song, Per Jesper Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Markus Reigl, Sacha Nelson, Dmitri B Chklovskii",

          "Automated Quality Assurance of Online NIR Analysers\n\nModern NIR analysers produce valuable data for closed-loop process control and optimisation practically in real time. Thus it is highly important to keep them in the best possible shape. Quality assurance (QA) of NIR analysers is an interesting and complex issue because it is not only the instrument and sample handling that has to be monitored. At the same time, validity of prediction models has to be assured. A system for fully automated QA of NIR analysers is described. The system takes care of collecting and organising spectra from various instruments, relevant laboratory, and process management system (PMS) data. Validation of spectra is based on simple diagnostics values derived from the spectra. Predictions are validated against laboratory (LIMS) or other online analyser results (collected from PMS). The system features automated alarming, reporting, trending, and charting functions for major key variables for easy visual inspection. Various textual and graphical reports are sent to maintenance people through email. The software was written with Borland Delphi 7 Enterprise. Oracle and PMS ODBC interfaces were used for accessing LIMS and PMS data using appropriate SQL queries. It will be shown that it is possible to take actions even before the quality of predictions is seriously affected, thus maximising the overall uptime of the instrument.\n\nAuthors: Kari Aaljoki",
          "Unusual presentation of basilar artery stroke secondary to patent foramen ovale: a case report\n\nWe report a case of a patient presenting with neuropsychiatric manifestations secondary to paradoxical embolism Unexplained rapid onset of confusion with amnesia and minimal neurological deficits can be a manifestation of various systemic causes of which stroke, either ischemic or hemorrhagic, is one. Thorough and systematic evaluation of these patients can be highly rewarding in terms of optimizing patient outcome. We report the case of a 45-year-old woman whose initial presentation was with acute onset of confusion, memory loss with personality change and headaches. A differential diagnosis of systemic illness and cerebral pathology was entertained. She was empirically treated for neurological infection. Brain imaging revealed bilateral thalamic and cerebellar infarction. Further evaluation with an aim to define the etiology, revealed the diagnosis of Patent Foramen Ovale with paradoxical embolism. The differential diagnosis of unexplained rapid onset of confusion, amnesia with minimal motor neurological deficits and relevant appropriate investigations are discussed in this case report. This case highlights the importance of recognising the atypical manifestations of posterior fossa stroke. In young patients presenting with non-focal neuropsychiatric manifestations, paradoxical embolism, secondary to patent foramen ovale is a possible cause.\n\nAuthors: Abdul Salam, Phil Sanmuganathan, Chris Pycock"

          "The Use of the Cancellation Technique to Quantify the Hermann Grid Illusion\n\nWhen observers view a grid of mid-gray lines superimposed on a black background, they report seeing illusory dark gray smudges at the grid intersections, an effect known as the Hermann grid illusion. The strength of the illusion is often measured using the cancellation technique: A white disk is placed over one of these intersections and the luminance of the disk is reduced until the disk disappears. Its luminance at this point, i.e., the disk's detection threshold, is taken to be a measure of the strength of the illusion. Our experiments showed that some distortions of the Hermann grid, which were sufficient to completely disrupt the illusion, did not reduce the disk's detection threshold. This showed that the cancellation technique is not a valid method for measuring the strength of the Hermann grid illusion. Those studies that attempted to use this technique inadvertently studied a different effect known as the blanking phenomenon. We conclude by presenting an explanation for the latter effect.\n\nAuthors: Piers D.L. Howe, Margaret S. Livingstone",
          "The effect of Warfarin and factor VII on tissue procoagulant activity and pulmonary seeding.\n\nPeri-tumour fibrin is a consistent feature of tumour stroma and is deposited shortly after tumour cell inoculation. Since there are several ways in which fibrin may be beneficial to tumour growth, it is possible that the ability of normal or malignant tissue to generate fibrin may influence metastasis. Many normal tissues and tumour cells possess a procoagulant activity that is due to a complex of tissue factor and factor VII. We have measured this tissue procoagulant activity in normal rats, rats stabilised on Warfarin and similarly anticoagulated animals injected with factor VII. The effect of Warfarin and factor VII administration on pulmonary seeding following injection of MC28 fibrosarcoma cells was also assessed. Procoagulant activity in adrenal, lung and colon was significantly reduced by Warfarin (P less than 0.001). Administration of factor VII significantly increased lung and adrenal tissue procoagulant activity in anticoagulated rats (P less than 0.02). Warfarinised rats had significantly slower primary tumour growth (P less than 0.001) and fewer lung deposits than control animals (P less than 0.001). Injection of factor VII restored pulmonary seeding to control levels (P less than 0.001). Warfarin did not affect the ability of the cells to adhere in vitro and did not reduce the number of tumour cells physically trapped in the lungs after intravenous injection. It is concluded that the procoagulant activity of normal tissues may influence their ability to support tumour growth and that the antimetastatic effect of Warfarin may be at least partly due to a reduction in the availability of the factor VII required for this activity.\n\nAuthors: J.

Subsequently, we have greatly extended the construction of SVRMHC models and have established such models for more than 40 class I and class II MHC molecules. Here we present the SVRMHC web server for predicting peptide-MHC binding affinities using these models. Benchmarked percentile scores are provided for all predictions. The larger number of SVRMHC models available allowed for an updated evaluation of the performance of the SVRMHC method compared to other well- known linear modeling methods.

          "Homosexual Women Have Less Grey Matter in Perirhinal Cortex than Heterosexual Women\n\nIs sexual orientation associated with structural differences in the brain? To address this question, 80 homosexual and heterosexual men and women (16 homosexual men and 15 homosexual women) underwent structural MRI. We used voxel-based morphometry to test for differences in grey matter concentration associated with gender and sexual orientation. Compared with heterosexual women, homosexual women displayed less grey matter bilaterally in the temporo-basal cortex, ventral cerebellum, and left ventral premotor cortex. The relative decrease in grey matter was most prominent in the left perirhinal cortex. The left perirhinal area also showed less grey matter in heterosexual men than in heterosexual women. Thus, in homosexual women, the perirhinal cortex grey matter displayed a more male-like structural pattern. This is in accordance with previous research that revealed signs of sex-atypical prenatal androgenization in homosexual women, but not in homosexual men. The relevance of the perirhinal area for high order multimodal (olfactory and visual) object, social, and sexual processing is discussed.\n\nAuthors: Jorge Ponseti, Hartwig R.

          "Recombination Difference between Sexes: A Role for Haploid Selection\n\nWhy the autosomal recombination rate differs between female and male meiosis in most species has been a genetic enigma since the early study of meiosis. Some hypotheses have been put forward to explain this widespread phenomenon and, up to now, only one fact has emerged clearly: In species in which meiosis is achiasmate in one sex, it is the heterogametic one. This pattern, known as the Haldane-Huxley rule, is thought to be a side effect, on autosomes, of the suppression of recombination between the sex chromosomes. However, this rule does not hold for heterochiasmate species (i.e., species in which recombination is present in both sexes but varies quantitatively between sexes) and does not apply to species lacking sex chromosomes, such as hermaphroditic plants. In this paper, we show that in plants, heterochiasmy is due to a male-female difference in gametic selection and is not influenced by the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This finding provides strong empirical support in favour of a population genetic explanation for the evolution of heterochiasmy and, more broadly, for the evolution of sex and recombination.\n\nAuthors: Thomas Lenormand, Julien Dutheil",

Below 10 mg kg-1 the survival curve was exponential through the origin with a D10 of approximately 2 mg kg-1, while above 15 mg kg-1 the D10 was approximately 25 mg kg-1. From linear extrapolation of the terminal part of the cell survival curve to zero drug dose, it appeared that about 1 in 10(5) (or 0.001%) of tumour cells were resistant to MeCCNU.\n\nAuthors: T. C.
