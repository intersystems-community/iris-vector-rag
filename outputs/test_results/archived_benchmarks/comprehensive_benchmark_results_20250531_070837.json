          "Relationship between risk information on total colonoscopy and patient preferences for colorectal cancer screening options: Analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process\n\nAlthough the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is the preferred program for colorectal cancer screening in Japan, many medical institutions have recently begun to provide total colonoscopy (TCS) as an initial screening program. However, there are a number of severe risks associated with TCS, such as colorectal bleeding and perforation. The justification for performing such a procedure on healthy patients remains unclear. We used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to investigate whether risk information on TCS affects patient preferences for colorectal cancer screening. We performed a questionnaire survey using an AHP decision-making model, targeting 285 people aged 40\u201359 years. We randomly assigned the subjects into Groups A (n = 146) and B (n = 139). Both groups were provided with information on the effectiveness, cost and disadvantages of the two screening programs. Group A was provided with additional information regarding the risks of TCS. Individual priorities were calculated with pair-wise comparisons between the two alternatives in each selection criteria. The influence of the risk information was analyzed using a logistic regression analysis. The aggregated priorities in Group A for 'effectiveness', 'costs', and 'risks' were 0.603, 0.147, and 0.250, respectively, while those in Group B were 0.652, 0.149, and 0.199, respectively. A logistic regression analysis showed that the provision of risk information significantly reduced the subjects' priorities for TCS (p = 0.036). The lack of risk information was related to the differences in priorities assigned to effectiveness and risks of the two procedures. Patients must be well informed before making decisions concerning their preferred colorectal cancer screening procedure.\n\nAuthors: Yuichi Katsumura, Hideo Yasunaga, Tomoaki Imamura, Kazuhiko Ohe, Hiroshi Oyama",

          "Identification of Importin 8 (IPO8) as the most accurate reference gene for the clinicopathological analysis of lung specimens\n\nThe accurate normalization of differentially expressed genes in lung cancer is essential for the identification of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers by real time RT-PCR and microarrays. Although classical \"housekeeping\" genes, such as GAPDH, HPRT1, and beta-actin have been widely used in the past, their accuracy as reference genes for lung tissues has not been proven. We have conducted a thorough analysis of a panel of 16 candidate reference genes for lung specimens and lung cell lines. Gene expression was measured by quantitative real time RT-PCR and expression stability was analyzed with the softwares  GeNorm  NormFinder Our data show that IPO8 is the most accurate reference gene for clinical lung specimens. In addition, we demonstrate that the commonly used genes GAPDH and HPRT1 are inappropriate to normalize data derived from lung biopsies, although they are suitable as reference genes for lung cell lines.

          "Diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of clinical and laboratory parameters in community-acquired pneumonia\n\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most frequent infection-related cause of death. The reference standard to diagnose CAP is a new infiltrate on chest radiograph in the presence of recently acquired respiratory signs and symptoms. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory biomarkers for CAP. 545 patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection, admitted to the emergency department of a university hospital were included in a pre-planned post-hoc analysis of two controlled intervention trials. Baseline assessment included history, clinical examination, radiography and measurements of procalcitonin (PCT), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and leukocyte count. Of the 545 patients, 373 had CAP, 132 other respiratory tract infections, and 40 other final diagnoses. The AUC of a clinical model including standard clinical signs and symptoms (i.e. fever, cough, sputum production, abnormal chest auscultation and dyspnea) to diagnose CAP was 0.79 [95% CI, 0.75\u20130.83]. This AUC was significantly improved by including PCT and hsCRP (0.92 [0.89\u20130.94]; p < 0.001). PCT had a higher diagnostic accuracy (AUC, 0.88 [0.84\u20130.93]) in differentiating CAP from other diagnoses, as compared to hsCRP (AUC, 0.76 [0.69\u20130.83]; p < 0.001) and total leukocyte count (AUC, 0.69 [0.62\u20130.77]; p < 0.001). To predict bacteremia, PCT had a higher AUC (0.85 [0.80\u20130.91]) as compared to hsCRP (p = 0.01), leukocyte count (p = 0.002) and elevated body temperature (p < 0.001). PCT, in contrast to hsCRP and leukocyte count, increased with increasing severity of CAP, as assessed by the pneumonia severity index (p < 0.001). PCT, and to a lesser degree hsCRP, improve the accuracy of currently recommended approaches for the diagnosis of CAP, thereby complementing clinical signs and symptoms. PCT is useful in the severity assessment of CAP.\n\nAuthors: Beat M\u00fcller, Stephan Harbarth, Daiana Stolz, Roland Bingisser, Christian Mueller, J\u00f6rg Leuppi, Charly Nusbaumer, Michael Tamm, Mirjam Christ-Crain",
          "Differences in service utilization and barriers among Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites with drug use disorders\n\nTreatment for drug use disorders (DUD) can be effective, but only a small proportion of people with DUD seek or receive treatment. Research on racial and ethnic treatment differences and disparities remains unclear. Understanding racial and ethnic differences and disparities in drug treatment is necessary in order to develop a more effective referral system and to improve the accessibility of treatment. The purpose of the current study was to explore the role of race and ethnicity in service utilization. Using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), this study examined racial and ethnic differences in use of 14 types of treatment services for DUD and 27 different treatment barriers among persons who met lifetime criteria for a DUD. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine service utilization and barriers among the racial and ethnic groups, while adjusting for other sociodemographic and clinical variables. Among Blacks, Hispanics and Whites in the overall NESARC sample, approximately 10.5% met criteria for at least one lifetime drug use disorder. Approximately 16.2% of persons with a lifetime DUD received at least one type of service. Overall, this study indicated that Whites were less likely to report receiving help for drug-related problems than Blacks, Blacks used a greater number of different types of services, and no racial and ethnic differences were observed with respect to perceived barriers to drug treatment. However, by examining types of services separately, a complex picture of racial and ethnic differences emerges. Most notably, Whites were most likely to use professional services, whereas Blacks were most likely to use 12-step and clergy. The service use pattern of Hispanics most resembled that of Whites. While structural barriers to accessing treatment were observed, broad-based educational programs and interventions that are appropriately targeted to racial and ethnic groups remains an important area for prevention and treatment.\n\nAuthors: Brian E Perron, Orion P Mowbray, Joseph E Glass, Jorge Delva, Michael G Vaughn, Mathew Owen Howard",
          "Performance of mitochondrial DNA mutations detecting early stage cancer\n\nMutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtgenome) have been associated with cancer and many other disorders. These mutations can be point mutations or deletions, or admixtures (heteroplasmy). The detection of mtDNA mutations in body fluids using resequencing microarrays, which are more sensitive than other sequencing methods, could provide a strategy to measure mutation loads in remote anatomical sites. We determined the mtDNA mutation load in the entire mitochondrial genome of 26 individuals with different early stage cancers (lung, bladder, kidney) and 12 heavy smokers without cancer. MtDNA was sequenced from three matched specimens (blood, tumor and body fluid) from each cancer patient and two matched specimens (blood and sputum) from smokers without cancer. The inherited wildtype sequence in the blood was compared to the sequences present in the tumor and body fluid, detected using the Affymetrix Genechip Using this high-throughput method, 75% of the tumors were found to contain mtDNA mutations, higher than in our previous studies, and 36% of the body fluids from these cancer patients contained mtDNA mutations. Most of the mutations detected were heteroplasmic. A statistically significantly higher heteroplasmy rate occurred in tumor specimens when compared to both body fluid of cancer patients and sputum of controls, and in patient blood compared to blood of controls. Only 2 of the 12 sputum specimens from heavy smokers without cancer (17%) contained mtDNA mutations. Although patient mutations were spread throughout the mtDNA genome in the lung, bladder and kidney series, a statistically significant elevation of tRNA and ND complex mutations was detected in tumors. Our findings indicate comprehensive mtDNA resequencing can be a high-throughput tool for detecting mutations in clinical samples with potential applications for cancer detection, but it is unclear the biological relevance of these detected mitochondrial mutations. Whether the detection of tumor-specific mtDNA mutations in body fluidsy this method will be useful for diagnosis and monitoring applications requires further investigation.\n\nAuthors: John P Jakupciak, Samantha Maragh, Maura E Markowitz, Alissa K Greenberg, Mohammad O Hoque, Anirban Maitra, Peter E Barker, Paul D Wagner, William N Rom, Sudhir Srivastava, David Sidransky, Catherine D O'Connell",

In particular, differential expression for splicing factors, RNA binding/pre-mRNA processing factors and spliceosome related genes were observed, indicating that RNA processing and editing related events may play critical roles in pancreatic tumor development and progression. High expression of insulin growth factor binding protein-1 (Igfbp1) and Serine proteinase inhibitor A1 (Serpina1), and low levels or absence of Wt1 gene expression were exclusive to liver metastatic lesion samples.

A promising nutritional approach suggested by this thematic review is metabolic effect of low glycaemic-index diet. The currently available scientific literature shows that low glycaemic-index diets acutely induce a number of favorable effects, such as a rapid weight loss, decrease of fasting glucose and insulin levels, reduction of circulating triglyceride levels and improvement of blood pressure. The long-term effect of the combination of these changes is at present not known.

          "Tezosentan reduces the microvascular filtration coefficient in isolated lungs from rats subjected to cecum ligation and puncture\n\nWe recently demonstrated that the non-selective endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor blocker tezosentan antagonizes ovine acute lung injury (ALI) following infusion of endotoxin or ET-1 by reducing the enhanced lung microvascular pressure, although we could not exclude the possibility of a simultaneous decline in microvascular permeability. In the present study, our aim was to find out if tezosentan reverses the rise in microvascular filtration coefficient (Kfc) in rat lungs that have been isolated and perfused 12 h after cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) or infusion of ET-1. Wistar rats (n = 42) were subjected to CLP. Postoperatively, rats were randomized to a CLP group (n = 7) and a CLP + tezosentan group (n = 7); the latter received tezosentan 30 mg/kg. A sham-operated group (n = 5) underwent laparotomy without CLP. Twelve hours postoperatively, the lungs were isolated and perfused with blood from similarly treated rats that also were used to assess plasma concentration of ET-1 and protein kinase C\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1) in lung tissue. Additionally, isolated blood perfused lungs from healthy rats were randomized to a control group (n = 8), an ET-1 group (n = 7) subjected to pulmonary arterial injection of ET-1 10 nM, and an ET-1 + tezosentan group (n = 7) that received tezosentan 30 mg/kg.

          "Age-related human small intestine methylation: evidence for stem cell niches\n\nThe small intestine is constructed of many crypts and villi, and mouse studies suggest that each crypt contains multiple stem cells. Very little is known about human small intestines because mouse fate mapping strategies are impractical in humans. However, it is theoretically possible that stem cell histories are inherently written within their genomes. Genomes appear to record histories (as exemplified by use of molecular clocks), and therefore it may be possible to reconstruct somatic cell dynamics from somatic cell errors. Recent human colon studies suggest that random somatic epigenetic errors record stem cell histories (ancestry and total numbers of divisions). Potentially age-related methylation also occurs in human small intestines, which would allow characterization of their stem cells and comparisons with the colon. Methylation patterns in individual crypts from 13 small intestines (17 to 78 years old) were measured by bisulfite sequencing. The methylation patterns were analyzed by a quantitative model to distinguish between immortal or niche stem cell lineages. Age-related methylation was observed in the human small intestines. Crypt methylation patterns were more consistent with stem cell niches than immortal stem cell lineages. Human large and small intestine crypt niches appeared to have similar stem cell dynamics, but relatively less methylation accumulated with age in the small intestines. There were no apparent stem cell differences between the duodenum and ileum, and stem cell survival did not appear to decline with aging. Crypt niches containing multiple stem cells appear to maintain human small intestines. Crypt niches appear similar in the colon and small intestine, and the small intestinal stem cell mitotic rate is the same as or perhaps slower than that of the colon. Although further studies are needed, age-related methylation appears to record somatic cell histories, and a somatic epigenetic molecular clock strategy may potentially be applied to other human tissues to reconstruct otherwise occult stem cell histories.\n\nAuthors: Jung Yeon Kim, Kimberly D Siegmund, Simon Tavar\u00e9, Darryl Shibata",

          "The detection of specific gene rearrangements in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using the polymerase chain reaction.\n\nCharacteristic gene rearrangements are present in most non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). These are usually detected by Southern blotting techniques. In this study, the ability of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement was evaluated. DNA from 14 follicular and 42 diffuse B-cell lymphomas was examined using oligonucleotide primers specific for opposing sides of the IgH gene rearrangement on chromosome 14 (towards conserved VH and JH sequences) and opposing sides of the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation (towards the major breakpoint region of the bcl-2 gene on chromosome 18 and conserved JH sequence on chromosome 14). The t(14;18) translocation was detected in 57% of follicular lymphomas and 21% of diffuse B-cell lymphomas. Clonal IgH gene rearrangements using PCR were detected in 50% follicular and 52% of the diffuse lymphomas. Either or both of these rearrangements were detected in 93% follicular and in 59% of diffuse lymphomas. PCR is a rapid and easy technique that can detect the abnormal rearrangement of the bcl-2 gene and clonal IgH rearrangement, indicating the presence of lymphoma.

These levels have been related to those in mucosa both adjacent to and distant from the tumour in the same patients. Cyclic AMP-BP were higher in tumour than in either adjacent (P less than 0.000001) or distant mucosa (P less than 0.00001). Binding of cAMP in adjacent mucosa was lower than that in distant mucosa (P less than 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the level of binding between tumours arising from different sites in the colon and binding was not related to age or sex of the patient. However, binding was higher in Dukes' B than Dukes' C cancers (P less than 0.005). There was also a trend for cAMP binding levels to be higher in moderately differentiated than in poorly differentiated cancers (P = 0.07).

The resulting derivative cell line, Me1R MCF-7, was 30-fold resistant to melphalan. Uptake studies demonstrated decreased initial melphalan accumulation in Me1R MCF-7 cells. Inverse-reciprocal plots of initial melphalan uptake revealed a 4-fold decrease in the apparent Vmax of Me1R MCF-7 compared with WT MCF-7 (516 amol cell-1 min-1 vs 2110 amol cell-1 min-1 respectively) as well as a decrease in the apparent Kt (36 microM vs 70 microM respectively). Two amino acid transporters have previously been identified as melphalan transporters: system L, which is sodium-independent and inhibited by 2-amino-bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), and system ASC which is sodium dependent and unaffected by BCH. At low concentrations of melphalan (3-30 microM), 1mM BCH competition eliminated the differences between the two cell lines, thus implicating an alteration of the system L transporter in the transport defect in the resistant cells. Me1R MCF-7 cells were also evaluated for glutathione-mediated detoxification mechanisms associated with melphalan resistance. There was no difference between Me1R MCF-7 and WT MCF-7 in glutathione content, glutathione-S-transferase activity and expression of pi class glutathione S-transferase RNA. In addition, buthionine sulfoximine did not reverse melphalan resistance in Me1R MCF-7 cells.

Participant observation, semistructured interviews, analysis of online messages, and online- and paper-based surveys were used to gather data about youth\u2019s and adults\u2019 perceptions and use of the technologies. Constant comparison method and between-method triangulation were used in the analysis to satisfy the existence of themes.  Not all youth were interested in working with computers. Some electronic messages from adults were perceived to be critical, and writing to adults was intimidating for some youth. In addition, technical problems were experienced. Despite these barriers, most youth perceived that using computers and the Internet reduced their anxiety concerning communication with adults, increased their control when dealing with adults, raised their perception of their social status, increased participation within the community, supported reflective thought, increased efficiency, and improved their access to resources.  Overall, youth perceived computers and the Internet to be empowering tools, and they should be encouraged to use such technology to support them in community initiatives.\n\nAuthors: Ruta K Valaitis\n\nKeywords: Computers, Internet, adolescent, power, public health, schools, social change",
          "In vivo and in vitro biotransformation of the lithium salt of gamma-linolenic acid by three human carcinomas.\n\nLipid metabolism has been considered recently as a novel target for cancer therapy. In this field, lithium gamma-linolenate (LiGLA) is a promising experimental compound for use in the treatment of human tumours. In vivo and in vitro studies allowed us to assess the metabolism of radiolabelled LiGLA by tumour tissue and different organs of the host. In vitro studies demonstrated that human pancreatic (AsPC-1), prostatic (PC-3) and mammary carcinoma (ZR-75-1) cells were capable of elongating GLA from LiGLA to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and further desaturating it to arachidonic acid (AA). AsPC-1 cells showed the lowest delta5-desaturase activity on DGLA. In the in vivo studies, nude mice bearing the human carcinomas were given Li[1-(14)C]GLA (2.5 mg kg(-1)) by intravenous injection for 30 min. Mice were either sacrificed after infusion or left for up to 96 h recovery before sacrifice. In general, the organs showed a maximum uptake of radioactivity 30 min after the infusion started (t = 0). Thereafter, in major organs the percentage of injected radioactivity per g of tissue declined below 1% 96 h after infusion. In kidney, brain, testes/ovaries and all three tumour tissues, labelling remained constant throughout the experiment. The ratio of radioactivity in liver to tumour tissues ranged between 16- and 24-fold at t = 0 and between 3.1- and 3.7-fold at 96 h. All tissues showed a progressive increase in the proportion of radioactivity associated with AA with a concomitant decrease in radiolabelled GLA as the time after infusion increased. DGLA declined rapidly in liver and plasma, but at a much slower rate in brain and malignant tissue. Seventy-two hours after the infusion, GLA was only detected in plasma and tumour tissue. The sum of GLA + DGLA varied among tumour tissues, but it remained 2-4 times higher than in liver and plasma. In brain, DGLA is the major contributor to the sum of these fatty acids. Data showed that cytotoxic GLA and DGLA, the latter provided either by the host or by endogenous synthesis, remained in human tumours for at least 4 days.\n\nAuthors: R. de Antueno, M. Elliot, G.

          "Involvement of PKR and RNase L in translational control and induction of apoptosis after Hepatitis C polyprotein expression from a Vaccinia virus recombinant\n\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is of growing concern in public health with around 350 million chronically infected individuals worldwide. Although the IFN-\u03b1/rivabirin is the only approved therapy with 10\u201330% clinical efficacy, the protective molecular mechanism involved during the treatment is still unknown. To analyze the effect of HCV polyprotein expression on the antiviral response of the host, we developed a novel vaccinia virus (VV)-based delivery system (VT7-HCV7.9) where structural and nonstructural (except part of NS5B) proteins of HCV ORF from genotype 1b are efficiently expressed and produced, and timely regulated in mammalian cell lines. Regulated transcript production and viral polypeptide processing was demonstrated in various cell lines infected with the recombinant VT7-HCV7.9, indicating that the cellular and viral proteolytic machineries are functional within these cells. The inducible expression of the HCV polyprotein by VV inhibits the synthesis of both host and viral proteins over the time and also induces apoptosis in HeLa and HepG2-infected cells. These effects occur accompanying with the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF-2\u03b1. In cells co-infected with VT7-HCV7.9 and a recombinant VV expressing the dominant negative eIF-2\u03b1-S51A mutant in the presence of the inductor isopropyl-thiogalactoside (IPTG), protein synthesis is rescued. The IFN-inducible protein kinase PKR is responsible for the translational block, as demonstrated with PKR-/- and PKR+/+ cell lines. However, apoptosis induced by VT7-HCV7.9 is mediated by the RNase L pathway, in a PKR-independent manner. These findings demonstrate the antiviral relevance of the proteins induced by interferon, PKR and RNase L during expression from a VV recombinant of the HCV polyprotein in human cell lines. HCV polyprotein expression caused a severe cytopathological effect in human cells as a result of inhibition of protein synthesis and apoptosis induction, triggered by the activation of the IFN-induced enzymes PKR and RNase L systems. Thus, the virus-cell system described here highlights the relevance of the IFN system as a protective mechanism against HCV infection.\n\nAuthors: Carmen E G\u00f3mez, Andr\u00e9e Marie Vandermeeren, Mar\u00eda Angel Garc\u00eda, Elena Domingo-Gil, Mariano Esteban",
          "Overdose beliefs and management practices among ethnic Vietnamese heroin users in Sydney, Australia\n\nEthnic Vietnamese injecting drug users (IDUs) in Australia draw on a range of beliefs and etiologic models, sometimes simultaneously, in order to make sense of health and illness. These include understandings of illness as the result of internal imbalances and Western concepts of disease causation including germ/pollution theory. Observational fieldwork and in-depth interviews were conducted between 2001 and 2006 in neighbourhoods characterised by high proportions of Asian background IDUs and street-based drug markets. Eligibility criteria for the study were: 1) ethnic Vietnamese cultural background; 2) aged 16 years and over and; 3) injected drugs in the last 6 months. Participants commonly attempted to treat heroin overdose by withdrawing blood (r\u00fat m\u00e1u) from the body. Central to this practice are cultural beliefs about the role and function of blood in the body and its relationship to illness and health. Participants' beliefs in blood were strongly influenced by understandings of blood expressed in traditional Chinese and Vietnamese medicine. Many participants perceived Western drugs, particularly heroin, as \"hot\" and \"strong\". In overdose situations, it was commonly believed that an excessive amount of drugs (particularly heroin) entered the bloodstream and traveled to the heart, making the heart work too hard. Withdrawing blood was understood to reduce the amount of drugs in the body which in turn reduced the effects of drugs on the blood and the heart. The explanatory model of overdose employed by ethnic Vietnamese IDUs privileges traditional beliefs about the circulatory, rather than the respiratory, system. This paper explores participants' beliefs about blood, the effects of drugs on blood and the causes of heroin overdose in order to document the explanatory model of overdose used by ethnic Vietnamese IDUs. Implications for overdose prevention, treatment and management are identified and discussed.\n\nAuthors: Lisa Maher, Hien T Ho",
          "Redistribution of PU.1 partner transcription factor RUNX1 binding secures cell survival during leukemogenesis\n\nTranscription factors (TFs) orchestrating lineage-development often control genes required for cellular survival. However, it is not well understood how cells survive when such TFs are lost, for example in cancer. PU.1 is an essential TF for myeloid fate, and mice with downregulated PU.1 levels develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Combining a multi-omics approach with a functional genetic screen, we reveal that PU.1-downregulated cells fundamentally change their survival control from cytokine-driven pathways to overexpression of an autophagy-predominated stem cell gene program, for which we also find evidence in human AML. Control of this program involves redirected chromatin occupancy of the PU.1 partner TF Runx1 to a lineage-inappropriate binding site repertoire. Hence, genomic reallocation of TF binding upon loss of a partner TF can act as a pro-oncogenic failsafe mechanism by sustaining cell survival during leukemogenesis.\n\nAuthors: Alexander Bender, F\u00fcsun Boydere, Ashok Kumar Jayavelu, Alessia Tibello, Thorsten K\u00f6nig, Hanna Aleth, Gerd Meyer zu H\u00f6rste, Thomas Vogl, Frank Rosenbauer\n\nKeywords: PU.1, RUNX1, Myeloid Development, Myeloid Leukemia",

          "Pathway analysis of kidney cancer using proteomics and metabolic profiling\n\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the sixth leading cause of cancer death and is responsible for 11,000 deaths per year in the US. Approximately one-third of patients present with disease which is already metastatic and for which there is currently no adequate treatment, and no biofluid screening tests exist for RCC. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive proteomic analysis and subsequently a pathway and network approach to identify biological processes involved in clear cell RCC (ccRCC). We have used these data to investigate urinary markers of RCC which could be applied to high-risk patients, or to those being followed for recurrence, for early diagnosis and treatment, thereby substantially reducing mortality of this disease. Using 2-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analysis, we identified 31 proteins which were differentially expressed with a high degree of significance in ccRCC as compared to adjacent non-malignant tissue, and we confirmed some of these by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and comparison to published transcriptomic data. When evaluated by several pathway and biological process analysis programs, these proteins are demonstrated to be involved with a high degree of confidence (p values < 2.0 E-05) in glycolysis, propanoate metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, urea cycle and arginine/proline metabolism, as well as in the non-metabolic p53 and FAS pathways. In a pilot study using random urine samples from both ccRCC and control patients, we performed metabolic profiling and found that only sorbitol, a component of an alternative glycolysis pathway, is significantly elevated at 5.4-fold in RCC patients as compared to controls. Extensive pathway and network analysis allowed for the discovery of highly significant pathways from a set of clear cell RCC samples. Knowledge of activation of these processes will lead to novel assays identifying their proteomic and/or metabolomic signatures in biofluids of patient at high risk for this disease; we provide pilot data for such a urinary bioassay. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the knowledge of networks, processes, and pathways altered in kidney cancer may be used to influence the choice of optimal therapy.\n\nAuthors: Bertrand Perroud, Jinoo Lee, Nelly Valkova, Amy Dhirapong, Pei-Yin Lin, Oliver Fiehn, Dietmar K\u00fcltz, Robert H Weiss",
          "Progressive multiple sequence alignments from triplets\n\nThe quality of progressive sequence alignments strongly depends on the accuracy of the individual pairwise alignment steps since gaps that are introduced at one step cannot be removed at later aggregation steps. Adjacent insertions and deletions necessarily appear in arbitrary order in pairwise alignments and hence form an unavoidable source of errors. Here we present a modified variant of progressive sequence alignments that addresses both issues. Instead of pairwise alignments we use exact dynamic programming to align sequence or profile triples. This avoids a large fractions of the ambiguities arising in pairwise alignments. In the subsequent aggregation steps we follow the logic of the Neighbor-Net algorithm, which constructs a phylogenetic network by step-wisely replacing triples by pairs instead of combining pairs to singletons. To this end the three-way alignments are subdivided into two partial alignments, at which stage all-gap columns are naturally removed. This alleviates the \"once a gap, always a gap\" problem of progressive alignment procedures. The three-way Neighbor-Net based alignment program aln3nn is shown to compare favorably on both protein sequences and nucleic acids sequences to other progressive alignment tools. In the latter case one easily can include scoring terms that consider secondary structure features. Overall, the quality of resulting alignments in general exceeds that of clustalw or other multiple alignments tools even though our software does not included heuristics for context dependent (mis)match scores.\n\nAuthors: Matthias Kruspe, Peter F Stadler",
          "Multilevel examination of minor salivary gland biopsy for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome significantly improves diagnostic performance of AECG classification criteria\n\nThe recently observed low reproducibility of focus score (FS) assessment at different section depths in a series of single minor salivary gland biopsies highlighted the need for a standardized protocol of extensive histopathological examination of such biopsies in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. For this purpose, a cumulative focus score (cFS) was evaluated on three slides cut at 200-\u03bcm intervals from each of a series of 120 salivary biopsies. The cFS was substituted for the baseline FS in the American\u2013European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria set for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome classification, and then test specificity and sensitivity were assessed against clinical patient re-evaluation. Test performances of the AECG classification with the original FS and the score obtained after multilevel examination were statistically compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The diagnostic performance of AECG classification significantly improved when the cFS was entered in the AECG classification; the improvement was mostly due to increased specificity in biopsies with a baseline FS \u2265 1 but <2. The assessment of a cFS obtained at three different section levels on minor salivary gland biopsies can be useful especially in biopsies with baseline FSs between 1 and 2.\n\nAuthors: Patrizia Morbini, Antonio Manzo, Roberto Caporali, Oscar Epis, Chiara Villa, Carmine Tinelli, Enrico Solcia, Carlomaurizio Montecucco\n\nKeywords: focus score, minor salivary gland biopsy, multilevel examination, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome",

          "Phosphorylation-facilitated sumoylation of MEF2C negatively regulates its transcriptional activity\n\nSumoylation has emerged as an important posttranslational regulatory mechanism for transcription factors and cofactors. Sumoylation of many transcription factors represses their transcriptional activities. The myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors plays an important role in regulating gene expression during myogenesis and has been recently shown to be sumoylated. Consistent with earlier reports, we show that sumoylation of MEF2C at K391 inhibits its transcriptional activity. Sumoylation of MEF2C does not block its DNA-binding activity. A small C-terminal fragment of MEF2C containing K391, referred to as delta-N2-MEF2C, is efficiently sumoylated and, when targeted to DNA, represses transcription at neighbouring promoters. Because delta-N2-MEF2C lacks the binding site for class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), this result suggests that sumoylation of MEF2C may help to recruit transcriptional repressors other than these HDACs. Intriguingly, we show that phosphorylation of S396 in MEF2C, a residue in close proximity to the major sumoylation site (K391) and known to be phosphorylated  in vivo in vitro in vivo  We propose that phosphorylation of MEF2C at S396 facilitates its sumoylation at K391, which in turn recruits yet unidentified co-repressors to inhibit transcription. Our studies further suggest that sumoylation motifs containing a phosphorylated serine or an acidic residue at the +5 position might be more efficiently sumoylated.\n\nAuthors: Jungseog Kang, Christian B Gocke, Hongtao Yu",

Half the practices were randomly allocated for screening, giving a cluster sampling of women. The total number in the trial is 65,000. Women with previously diagnosed breast cancer are excluded. Women allocated for screening are invited to the clinic and screened according to the procedures specified in the U.K. protocol, having clinical examination every year and mammography on alternate years. The two modalities of screening are assessed independently and the role of nurses is being evaluated. Breast cancer incidence is monitored by pathology register and the local cancer registry office and deaths from the General Register office. Long-term follow-up will be obtained through flagging at NHS Central Register. To determine the value of screening, standard statistical methods will be used to compare breast cancer mortality rates in the whole of the screening population with that of the controls.

Although the pretreatment of lignocellulose is necessary for efficient saccharification and fermentation, numerous by-products, including furan derivatives, weak acids, and phenolic compounds, are generated in the pretreatment step. Many of these components inhibit the growth and fermentation of yeast. In particular, vanillin is one of the most effective inhibitors in lignocellulose hydrolysates because it inhibits fermentation at very low concentrations. To identify the genes required for tolerance to vanillin, we screened a set of diploid yeast deletion mutants, which are powerful tools for clarifying the function of particular genes. Seventy-six deletion mutants were identified as vanillin-sensitive mutants. The numerous deleted genes in the vanillin-sensitive mutants were classified under the functional categories for 'chromatin remodeling' and 'vesicle transport', suggesting that these functions are important for vanillin tolerance. The cross-sensitivity of the vanillin-sensitive mutants to furan derivatives, weak acids, and phenolic compounds was also examined. Genes for ergosterol biosynthesis were required for tolerance to all inhibitory compounds tested, suggesting that ergosterol is a key component of tolerance to various inhibitors.

          "Laparoscopy in the management of pediatric vesicoureteral reflux\n\nThe prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been estimated as. 4 to 1.8% among the pediatric population. In children with urinary tract infection the prevalence is typically from 30-50% with higher incidence occurring in infancy. When correction of VUR is determined to be necessary, traditionally open ureteral reimplantation by a variety of techniques has been the mainstay of treatment. This approach is justified because surgical correction affords a very high success rate of 99% in experienced hands and a low complication rate. In that context the purpose of this review article is to highlight the use of laparoscopy and robot-assisted techniques to perform ureteric reimplantation for the management of pediatric VUR. A detailed review of recent literature on the subject is performed to find out various aspects of minimally invasive surgery in the treatment of VUR, highlighting evolution of management approaches, operative steps, complications, results and the current status in clinical practice. We also share our experience on the subject.\n\nAuthors: Atul A. Thakre, B. Sreedhar, C. K. Yeung\n\nKeywords: CO, da Vinci robot, laparoscopy, MIS, ureteric reimplantation, vesicoureteral reflux",
          "Modelling the Impact of Antiretroviral Use in Resource-Poor Settings\n\nThe anticipated scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in high-prevalence, resource-constrained settings requires operational research to guide policy on the design of treatment programmes. Mathematical models can explore the potential impacts of various treatment strategies, including timing of treatment initiation and provision of laboratory monitoring facilities, to complement evidence from pilot programmes. A deterministic model of HIV transmission incorporating ART and stratifying infection progression into stages was constructed. The impact of ART was evaluated for various scenarios and treatment strategies, with different levels of coverage, patient eligibility, and other parameter values. These strategies included the provision of laboratory facilities that perform CD4 counts and viral load testing, and the timing of the stage of infection at which treatment is initiated. In our analysis, unlimited ART provision initiated at late-stage infection (AIDS) increased prevalence of HIV infection. The effect of additionally treating pre-AIDS patients depended on the behaviour change of treated patients. Different coverage levels for ART do not affect benefits such as life-years gained per person-year of treatment and have minimal effect on infections averted when treating AIDS patients only. Scaling up treatment of pre-AIDS patients resulted in more infections being averted per person-year of treatment, but the absolute number of infections averted remained small. As coverage increased in the models, the emergence and risk of spread of drug resistance increased. Withdrawal of failing treatment (clinical resurgence of symptoms), immunologic (CD4 count decline), or virologic failure (viral rebound) increased the number of infected individuals who could benefit from ART, but effectiveness per person is compromised. Only withdrawal at a very early stage of treatment failure, soon after viral rebound, would have a substantial impact on emergence of drug resistance. Our analysis found that ART cannot be seen as a direct transmission prevention measure, regardless of the degree of coverage. Counselling of patients to promote safe sexual practices is essential and must aim to effect long-term change.

The chaotic life-style of many injection drug users (IDUs), however, extends far beyond their health, and impacts upon social relationships, employment opportunities, housing, and day to day survival. Most current quality of life instruments do not capture the realities of people living with addictions. The Injection Drug Users' Quality of Life Scale (IDUQOL) was developed to reflect the life areas of relevance to IDUs. The present study examined the content validity of the IDUQOL using judgmental methods based on subject matter experts' (SMEs) ratings of various elements of this measure (e.g., appropriateness of life areas or items, names and descriptions of life areas, instructions for administration and scoring). Six SMEs were provided with a copy of the IDUQOL and its administration and scoring manual and a detailed content validation questionnaire. Two commonly used judgmental measures of inter-rater agreement, the Content Validity Index (CVI) and the Average Deviation Mean Index (AD M A total of 75 elements of the IDUQOL were examined. The CVI results showed that all elements were endorsed by the required number of SMEs or more. The AD M  The results of the study provided strong evidence in support of the content validity of the IDUQOL and direction for the revision of some IDUQOL elements.\n\nAuthors: Anita M Hubley, Anita Palepu",

          "Long-term consequences of traumatic experiences: an assessment of former political detainees in romania\n\nResearch has suggested that organized violence and torture have long-term psychological effects that persist throughout the lifespan. The present survey aimed at examining the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other disorders and symptoms, all present in old age, as long-term consequences of politically motivated violence in a comparison design. A group of former political detainees (N = 59, mean age 73.5 years) who had been arrested by the Romanian communist regime were compared to an age- and gender-matched control group (N = 39). PTSD was assessed using a structured clinical interview (CIDI). The investigation of the clinical profile was further accomplished by self-rating measures for anxiety, depression, and health-related functioning, as well as by clinician-administrated interviews for substance abuse, dissociation, and somatization symptoms. Lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 54%. In the case of participants left untreated, PTSD persisted, often over four decades, such that current PTSD was diagnosed still in a third of the survivors. Other clinical conditions such as somatization, substance abuse, dissociative disorders, and major depression were also common among the former political detainees and often associated with current PTSD. Our findings suggest that political detention may have long-term psychological consequences that outlast the changes in the political system.\n\nAuthors: Dana Bichescu, Maggie Schauer, Evangelia Saleptsi, Adrian Neculau, Thomas Elbert, Frank Neuner",
          "What makes people decide who to turn to when faced with a mental health problem? Results from a French survey\n\nThe unequal use of mental health care is a great issue, even in countries with universal health coverage. Better knowledge of the factors that have an impact on the pathway to mental health care may be a great help for designing education campaigns and for best organizing health care delivery. The objective of this study is to explore the determinants of help-seeking intentions for mental health problems and which factors influence treatment opinions and the reliance on and compliance with health professionals' advice. 441 adults aged 18 to 70 were randomly selected from the general population of two suburban districts near Paris and agreed to participate in the study (response rate = 60.4%). The 412 respondents with no mental health problems based on the CIDI-SF and the CAGE, who had not consulted for a mental health problem in the previous year, were asked in detail about their intentions to seek help in case of a psychological disorder and about their opinion of mental health treatments. The links between the respondents' characteristics and intentions and opinions were explored. More than half of the sample (57.8%) would see their general practitioner (GP) first and 46.6% would continue with their GP for follow-up. Mental health professionals were mentioned far less than GPs. People who would choose their GP first were older and less educated, whereas those who would favor mental health specialists had lower social support. For psychotherapy, respondents were split equally between seeing a GP, a psychiatrist or a psychologist. People were reluctant to take psychotropic drugs, but looked favorably on psychotherapy. GPs are often the point of entry into the mental health care system and need to be supported. Public information campaigns about mental health care options and treatments are needed to educate the public, eliminate the stigma of mental illness and eliminate prejudices.\n\nAuthors: Viviane Kovess-Masf\u00e9ty, Delphine Saragoussi, Christine Sevilla-Dedieu, Fabien Gilbert, Agnieszka Suchocka, Nathalie Arveiller, Isabelle Gasquet, Nadia Younes, Marie-Christine Hardy-Bayle",
          "Another explanation for the low allergy rate in the rural Alpine foothills\n\nA low allergy rate in coal and wood heated homes has been described in the small villages in the Alpine foothills and subsequently found to be associated with the farming environment. This was interpreted within the framework of the hygiene hypothesis but there are also alternative explanations. Lower air pollution could be one reason, which is, however, unlikely since the differences between the Bavarian countryside and the Munich municipal area were only weak. There could be genetic differences between the urban and rural population by previous isolation or by self-selection. The potential drop-out of allergy genes, however, will also not explain the absent increase of allergies in two generations. More likely, other lifestyle factors are important. Dietary habits are different in farmers and a less frequent vitamin D supplementation of newborns (otherwise expected to be allergy promoting) has been shown recently. The underlying cause for the \"non-allergic farm child\" remains speculative until the transfer of any farm-associated factor is leading to a similar risk reduction in the general population.\n\nAuthors: Matthias Wjst",

          "BMP4 signaling is involved in the generation of inner ear sensory epithelia\n\nThe robust expression of BMP4 in the incipient sensory organs of the inner ear suggests possible roles for this signaling protein during induction and development of auditory and vestibular sensory epithelia. Homozygous BMP4-/- animals die before the inner ear's sensory organs develop, which precludes determining the role of BMP4 in these organs with simple gene knockout experiments. Here we use a chicken otocyst culture system to perform quantitative studies on the development of inner ear cell types and show that hair cell and supporting cell generation is remarkably reduced when BMP signaling is blocked, either with its antagonist noggin or by using soluble BMP receptors. Conversely, we observed an increase in the number of hair cells when cultured otocysts were treated with exogenous BMP4. BMP4 treatment additionally prompted down-regulation of Pax-2 protein in proliferating sensory epithelial progenitors, leading to reduced progenitor cell proliferation. Our results implicate BMP4 in two events during chicken inner ear sensory epithelium formation: first, in inducing the switch from proliferative sensory epithelium progenitors to differentiating epithelial cells and secondly, in promoting the differentiation of hair cells within the developing sensory epithelia.\n\nAuthors: Huawei Li, Carleton E Corrales, Zhengmin Wang, Yanling Zhao, Yucheng Wang, Hong Liu, Stefan Heller",

          "Smoking cessation and harm reduction: a systematic overview of ongoing, randomized controlled trials\n\nSmoking remains one of the major public health threats, necessitating substantial scientific and societal interest in further developing and implementing systematic, smoking cessation trials. This review examines ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on smoking cessation and harm reduction, focusing on adherence to German S3 guidelines for tobacco dependence and identifying areas needing further research and neglected aspects in the implementation of treatment guidelines for tobacco dependence. A systematic search was conducted on the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, comprising multiple trial registries worldwide, to identify ongoing RCTs focusing on smoking cessation and harm reduction. Utilizing the PICOS-scheme, we focused on trials targeting the general population, with biochemical verification, psychological counseling, telemedicine, and nicotine replacement therapy /smoking cessation medication or electronic nicotine delivery systems. Exclusion criteria included trials marked as \"completed,\" \"terminated,\" \"unknown,\" or \"withdrawn.\". The review identified 30 ongoing RCTs, with a majority located in North America. A significant number of trials focus on socioeconomically disadvantaged or uninsured populations, while few address cancer survivors or individuals with smoking-related diseases. Nicotine replacement therapy or smoking cessation medication is consistently used across trials, but with varying regimens. Psychotherapeutic interventions are employed in 22 trials, with motivational interviewing being the most common method. Only four trials utilize electronic nicotine delivery systems as a harm reduction strategy. The lack of standardized reporting in trial registries was a significant barrier to synthesizing and categorizing information. Geographic representation is predominantly in North America, suggesting a need for more diverse trial locations. There is a critical need for more RCTs involving electronic nicotine delivery systems and tailored psychotherapeutic interventions. Expanding trial locations beyond North America and standardizing trial reporting could enhance the global applicability of smoking cessation strategies. Future research should focus on the long-term risks and benefits of electronic nicotine delivery systems, particularly in high-risk populations. This approach will aid in developing more effective and culturally relevant smoking cessation guidelines.

Before TP, acute oxygen supply improved mean exercise tolerance. But this response was heterogeneous as only 8 patients increased their walking distance with oxygen. TP improved exercise tolerance in the entire population. However, a greater affect of oxygen administration during exercise was not observed after TP. The response to oxygen again showed great disparity as only 6 patients increased their walking distance with oxygen after TP. The response to oxygen supply during exercise varied among COPD patients.

          "Transcriptomic identification of candidate genes involved in sunflower responses to chilling and salt stresses based on cDNA microarray analysis\n\nConsidering that sunflower production is expanding to arid regions, tolerance to abiotic stresses as drought, low temperatures and salinity arises as one of the main constrains nowadays. Differential organ-specific sunflower ESTs (expressed sequence tags) were previously generated by a subtractive hybridization method that included a considerable number of putative abiotic stress associated sequences. The objective of this work is to analyze concerted gene expression profiles of organ-specific ESTs by fluorescence microarray assay, in response to high sodium chloride concentration and chilling treatments with the aim to identify and follow up candidate genes for early responses to abiotic stress in sunflower. Abiotic-related expressed genes were the target of this characterization through a gene expression analysis using an organ-specific cDNA fluorescence microarray approach in response to high salinity and low temperatures. The experiment included three independent replicates from leaf samples. We analyzed 317 unigenes previously isolated from differential organ-specific cDNA libraries from leaf, stem and flower at R1 and R4 developmental stage. A statistical analysis based on mean comparison by ANOVA and ordination by Principal Component Analysis allowed the detection of 80 candidate genes for either salinity and/or chilling stresses. Out of them, 50 genes were up or down regulated under both stresses, supporting common regulatory mechanisms and general responses to chilling and salinity. Interestingly 15 and 12 sequences were up regulated or down regulated specifically in one stress but not in the other, respectively. These genes are potentially involved in different regulatory mechanisms including transcription/translation/protein degradation/protein folding/ROS production or ROS-scavenging. Differential gene expression patterns were confirmed by qRT-PCR for 12.5% of the microarray candidate sequences. Eighty genes isolated from organ-specific cDNA libraries were identified as candidate genes for sunflower early response to low temperatures and salinity. Microarray profiling of chilling and NaCl-treated sunflower leaves revealed dynamic changes in transcript abundance, including transcription factors, defense/stress related proteins, and effectors of homeostasis, all of which highlight the complexity of both stress responses. This study not only allowed the identification of common transcriptional changes to both stress conditions but also lead to the detection of stress-specific genes not previously reported in sunflower. This is the first organ-specific cDNA fluorescence microarray study addressing a simultaneous evaluation of concerted transcriptional changes in response to chilling and salinity stress in cultivated sunflower.\n\nAuthors: Paula Fernandez, Julio Di Rienzo, Luis Fernandez, H Esteban Hopp, Norma Paniego, Ruth A Heinz",

          "An optimized procedure greatly improves EST vector contamination removal\n\nThe enormous amount of sequence data available in the public domain database has been a gold mine for researchers exploring various themes in life sciences, and hence the quality of such data is of serious concern to researchers. Removal of vector contamination is one of the most significant operations to obtain accurate sequence data containing only a cDNA insert from the basecalls output by an automatic DNA sequencer. Popular bioinformatics programs to accomplish vector trimming include LUCY, cross_match and SeqClean. In a recent study, where the program SeqClean was used to remove vector contamination from our test set of EST data compiled through various library construction systems, however, a significant number of errors remained after preliminary trimming. These errors were later almost completely corrected by simply using a re-linearized form of the cloning vector to compare against the target ESTs. The modified trimming procedure for SeqClean was also compared with the trimming efficiency of the other two popular programs, LUCY2, and cross_match. Using SeqClean with a re-linearized form of the cloning vector significantly surpassed the other two programs in all tested conditions, while the performance of the other two programs was not influenced by the modified procedure. Vector contamination in dbEST was also investigated in this study: 2203 out of the 48212 ESTs sampled from dbEST (2007-04-18 freeze) were found to match sequences in UNIVEC. Vector contamination remains a serious concern to the data quality in the public sequence database nowadays.

          "A follow-up study of heroin addicts (VEdeTTE2): study design and protocol\n\nIn Italy, a large cohort study (VEdeTTE1) was conducted between 1998\u20132001 to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments in reducing mortality and increasing treatment retention among heroin addicts. The follow-up of this cohort (VEdeTTE2) was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments on long-term outcomes, such as rehabilitation and social re-integration. The purpose of this paper is to describe the protocol of the VEdeTTE2 study, and to present the results of the pilot study carried out to assess the feasibility of the study and to improve study procedures. The source population for the VEdeTTE2 study was the VEdeTTE1 cohort, from which a sample of 2,200 patients, traced two or more years after enrolment in the cohort, were asked to participate. An interview investigates drug use; overdose; family and social re-integration. Illegal activity are investigated separately in a questionnaire completed by the patient. Patients are also asked to provide a hair sample to test for heroin and cocaine use. Information on treatments and HIV, HBV and HCV morbidity are obtained from clinical records. A pilot phase was planned and carried out on 60 patients. The results of the pilot phase pointed out the validity of the procedures designed to limit attrition: the number of traced subjects was satisfactory (88%). Moreover, the pilot phase was very useful in identifying possible causes of delays and attrition, and flaws in the instruments. Improvements to the procedures and the instruments were subsequently implemented. Sensitivity of the biological test was quite good for heroin (78%) but lower for cocaine (42.3%), highlighting the need to obtain a hair sample from all patients. In drug addiction research, studies investigating health status and social re-integration of subjects at long-term follow-up are lacking. The VEdeTTE2 study aims to investigate these outcomes at long-term follow-up.

However, rising incidence does not necessarily imply failure to control tuberculosis transmission, which is primarily driven by prevalent infectious disease. We investigated the epidemiology of prevalent and incident TB in a high HIV prevalence population provided with enhanced primary health care. Twenty-two businesses in Harare, Zimbabwe, were provided with free smear- and culture-based investigation of TB symptoms through occupational clinics. Anonymised HIV tests were requested from all employees. After 2 y of follow-up for incident TB, a culture-based survey for undiagnosed prevalent TB was conducted. A total of 6,440 of 7,478 eligible employees participated. HIV prevalence was 19%. For HIV-positive and -negative participants, the incidence of culture-positive tuberculosis was 25.3 and 1.3 per 1,000 person-years, respectively (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 18.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.3 to 34.5: population attributable fraction = 78%), and point prevalence after 2 y was 5.7 and 2.6 per 1,000 population (adjusted odds ratio = 1.7; 95% CI = 0.5 to 6.8: population attributable fraction = 14%). Most patients with prevalent culture-positive TB had subclinical disease when first detected. Strategies based on prompt investigation of TB symptoms, such as DOTS, may be an effective way of controlling prevalent TB in high HIV prevalence populations. This may translate into effective control of TB transmission despite high TB incidence rates and a period of subclinical infectiousness in some patients.\n\nAuthors: Elizabeth L Corbett, Tsitsi Bandason, Yin Bun Cheung, Shungu Munyati, Peter Godfrey-Faussett, Richard Hayes, Gavin Churchyard, Anthony Butterworth, Peter Mason",

          "We applied a combined experimental and computational approach to ascertain how peptides interact with host and microbial membrane surrogates, in order to validate simulation methodology we hope will enable the development of insights applicable to the design of novel antimicrobial peptides. We studied the interactions of two truncated versions of the potent, but cytotoxic, antimicrobial octadecapeptide protegrin-1, PC-72 [LCYCRRRFCVC] and PC-73 [CYCRRRFCVC]. We used a combination of FTIR, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to examine the peptides' interactions with sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. The relative amounts of secondary structure determined by FTIR agreed with those from the simulations. Fluorescence spectroscopy, deuterium exchange experiments and the simulations all indicate that neither peptide embeds itself deeply into the micelle core. Although molecular simulations placed both peptides at the micelle-water interface, further examination revealed differences in how certain residues interacted with the micelle core. We demonstrate here the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations methods through comparison with experiments, and have used the simulation results to enhance the understanding of how these two peptides interact with the two types of micelles. We find agreement between simulation and experimental results in the final structure of the peptides and in the peptides final conformation with respect to the micelle. Looking in depth at the peptide interactions, we find differences in the interactions between the two peptides from the simulation data; Leu-1 on PC-72 interacts strongly with the SDS micelle, though the interaction is not persistent \u2013 the residue withdraws and inserts into the micelle throughout the simulation.",
          "The breastfeeding experience of women with major difficulties who use the services of a breastfeeding clinic: a descriptive study\n\nMany women experience breastfeeding difficulties. Sometimes these difficulties lead to breastfeeding cessation. Breastfeeding clinics provide support for women facing such problems. This study aims to describe the breastfeeding experience of women, particularly those who use the services of the breastfeeding clinic located in the Greater Quebec City area. This is a descriptive study based on information gathered through telephone questionnaires that were administered in 2006 to a sample of 86 women and semi-structured interviews conducted with 12 of these women. Painful nipples/breasts, low milk supply and latching difficulties were the three most frequent major breastfeeding problems identified by women. Their personal characteristics as well as the moral and physical support provided by family and friends and by health professional and clinicians at the breastfeeding clinic were the factors identified most often as having a positive influence on the breastfeeding experience. The results suggest that breastfeeding clinics have a critical role to play in improving the breastfeeding experience of women with major difficulties.\n\nAuthors: Caroline Lamontagne, Anne-Marie Hamelin, Monik St-Pierre",

The objectives of this study were to determine the influences of (1) age (2) seasonality (3) and circulating testosterone (SrTest), triiodothyronine (SrT3) and tetraiodothyronine (SrT4), as well as seminal (4) testosterone (SpTest), zinc (SpZn) and protein (SpTP) on semen quality in the Asian elephant Analyses, including motility, viability and morphology were performed in semen samples collected twice monthly from 13 elephant bulls (age range, 10-to 72-years) by manual stimulation between July 2004 and June 2005. Serum samples obtained monthly were assessed for SrTest, SrT3, SrT4, and seminal plasma samples were evaluated for, SpTest, SpZn and SpTP. The highest semen quality was observed at age 23 to 43 years. Percentages of progressive motility and viable sperm were lowest at age 51 to 70 years (P < 0.05); on the other hand, sperm concentration was lowest at age 10 to 19 years (P < 0.05). Percentage of sperm with normal morphology was highest at age 23 to 43 years. The levels of SrT3, SrTest, SpTest and SpZn were lowest at age 51 to 70 years, whereas SrT4 was lowest at age 23 to 43 years. Seasonality significantly affected semen characteristics in which percentage of viable sperm and cell concentration were highest during rainy season and lowest during summer months (P < 0.05). However, percentage of sperm with normal morphology was highest in summer and lowest in rainy season (P < 0.05). Seasonality significantly influenced SrTest with elevated concentrations observed in rainy season and winter (P < 0.05). This study indicates that age and seasonality had influence on semen characteristics in the Asian elephant. The knowledge obtained in this study will improve our understanding of the reproductive biology of this species.\n\nAuthors: Nikorn Thongtip, Jumnian Saikhun, Sittidet Mahasawangkul, Kornchai Kornkaewrat, Pornsawan Pongsopavijitr, Nucharin Songsasen, Anuchai Pinyopummin",
          "Tumour growth inhibition in mice by glycosylated recombinant human lymphotoxin: analysis of tumour-regional mononuclear cells involved with its action.\n\nWe compared the antitumour effects of glycosylated LT (gLT), nonglycosylated LT and TNF against a solid tumour in mice. We found that: (a) The systemic administration of gLT showed significant antitumour activity. These effects were, however, quite small in nude mice. Nonglycosylated LT and TNF attained the same degree of effectiveness as gLT, but at a 5-times higher dose. The serum half-life of gLT was 3-fold longer than that of nonglycosylated LT and 22-fold longer than that of TNF. (b) The effect of gLT was significantly blocked by pretreatment with anti-asialo GM1 antibody. Treatment with gLT produced a significant reduction in numbers of tumour-regional mononuclear cells, which in turn, produced increases intensive necrosis. (c) Mononuclear cells in the tumour tissues before gLT-injection were predominantly IL-2 receptor +/CD3- cells and CD3+ cells. Pretreatment with the anti-asialo GM1 antibody produced a drastic reduction of IL-2 receptor +/CD3- cells. These findings suggest that the efficient antitumour effect of gLT is due to a longer serum half-life than that of nonglycosylated LT or TNF in vivo, and its function is largely mediated by IL-2 receptor +/CD3- cells.\n\nAuthors: I.

          "Reductionist and system approaches to study the role of infection in preterm labor and delivery\n\nA substantial number of patients with preterm labor and delivery do not show clinical signs of infection, however, it is the subclinical form which is the main causative factor and often results in premature delivery. The hitherto commonly applied methods of inflammation detection are based either on potentially hazardous amniocentesis or still insufficient inflammation-related protein measurement in the serum or other biological fluids. The advent of new \"omics\" technologies has led to a paradigm-shift in experimental approach which tends to primarily generate rather than form hypotheses. This has resulted in a surge of wealth of data composed of sets of individual or clusters of new genes and proteins that can be of potential importance as new markers of inflammation leading to preterm labor. It is hoped that as a result of those new methodologies the overall perception of medical research and practice would gradually change from reductionist to systems approach. Despite several successes of reductionism in the diagnosis and treatment of preterm labor it seems that system-based methodology would contribute to a more favorable personalized rather than one-for-all patient assistance. In this review we present the current knowledge on this new attractive field of medical studies with emphasis on early detection of infection related with preterm labor.\n\nAuthors: Piotr Laudanski, Piotr Pierzynski, Tadeusz Laudanski",

          "ParaKMeans: Implementation of a parallelized K-means algorithm suitable for general laboratory use\n\nDuring the last decade, the use of microarrays to assess the transcriptome of many biological systems has generated an enormous amount of data. A common technique used to organize and analyze microarray data is to perform cluster analysis. While many clustering algorithms have been developed, they all suffer a significant decrease in computational performance as the size of the dataset being analyzed becomes very large. For example, clustering 10000 genes from an experiment containing 200 microarrays can be quite time consuming and challenging on a desktop PC. One solution to the scalability problem of clustering algorithms is to distribute or parallelize the algorithm across multiple computers. The software described in this paper is a high performance multithreaded application that implements a parallelized version of the K-means Clustering algorithm. Most parallel processing applications are not accessible to the general public and require specialized software libraries (e.g. MPI) and specialized hardware configurations. The parallel nature of the application comes from the use of a web service to perform the distance calculations and cluster assignments. Here we show our parallel implementation provides significant performance gains over a wide range of datasets using as little as seven nodes. The software was written in C# and was designed in a modular fashion to provide both deployment flexibility as well as flexibility in the user interface. ParaKMeans was designed to provide the general scientific community with an easy and manageable client-server application that can be installed on a wide variety of Windows operating systems.\n\nAuthors: Piotr Kraj, Ashok Sharma, Nikhil Garge, Robert Podolsky, Richard A McIndoe",

          "Predictors of Self-rated Health Status Among Texas Residents\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the predictors of self-rated health status for Texas adults using the current 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. Self-rated health is generally accepted as a valid measure of health status in population studies, and understanding its correlates may help public health professionals prioritize health-promotion and disease-prevention interventions. The two research questions addressed by this study involved the predictors of self-rated health: 1) \"Do demographic characteristics, health care coverage, leisure-time physical activity, and body mass index predict self-rated health status for Texas residents aged 18 to 64 years?\" and 2) \"Does choice of interview language (English vs Spanish) predict self-rated health status for Texas residents of Hispanic ethnicity aged 18 to 64 years?\" Key analysis variables were identified, and descriptive statistics were used to describe the major variables and determine whether the number of respondents for each variable was sufficient for analysis. Multivariate regression analysis was used to assess the variables. Multiple logistic regression analysis (controlling for diabetes and arthritis) of the self-rated health predictors indicated that older age, lack of health care coverage, lack of a college education, being Hispanic, having a lower income, obesity, and not exercising explained 19.4% of the variance of fair and poor self-rated health. The interview language (English or Spanish), age, sex, education, income, obesity, health insurance coverage, and physical activity (controlling for chronic illness) explained 22.8% of the variance in fair and poor self-rated health for Hispanic respondents. The results of this study suggest that a college education, a lower body mass index, non-Hispanic ethnicity, and participation in physical activity are associated with good, very good, or excellent self-rated health status. The finding that the interview language significantly predicted fair and poor self-rated health substantiates previous research and emphasizes the importance of culturally sensitive approaches to health care services.\n\nAuthors: Lorraine J Phillips, Renee L Hammock, Jimmy M Blanton",
          "Carcinogen-induced depletion of cutaneous Langerhans cells.\n\nThe chemical carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz (a) anthracene (DMBA) is a potent carcinogen which, when applied to the skin of BALB/c mice weekly for 7-8 weeks, causes the induction of macroscopically visible skin tumours. We report that DMBA also depletes Langerhans cells (LC) from treated skin; the number of cutaneous LC is reduced by nearly 50% 3 days after the first application of DMBA, and continues to decrease upon further treatment. After 7-8 weeks of DMBA application, while tumours are becoming macroscopically visible, there is a considerably lower LC density in treated skin. Upon cessation of the DMBA treatment, the LC repopulate the skin, returning to control values within 55-64 days. During this repopulation of the skin by LC, the tumours begin to decrease in size. Since LC function as local cutaneous antigen-presenting cells, and are responsible for initiation of an immune response against antigens in the skin, their depletion during tumour induction may allow DMBA-transformed cells to circumvent the immune system and form tumours. Their reappearance associated with tumour regression suggests that the LC are involved in an immune response against the tumours.\n\nAuthors: H. K. Muller, G. M. Halliday, B. A. Knight",

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 261 cases diagnosed with cancer of the larynx or tongue between 1995 and 1999. Cases were followed through December 31, 2002. Survival curves by margin status were generated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Categorical data were evaluated with odds ratios (OR). All-cause mortality was markedly higher in cases with positive margins as compared with those with negative margins (54% versus 29%,  P  Our findings suggest that positive surgical margin status is associated with increased mortality. This association also generally persists after adjustment for tumor size, stage, and adjuvant therapy.\n\nAuthors: Reina Haque, Richard Contreras, Michael P McNicoll, Evelyn C Eckberg, Diana B Petitti"

          "Relationship between risk information on total colonoscopy and patient preferences for colorectal cancer screening options: Analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process\n\nAlthough the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is the preferred program for colorectal cancer screening in Japan, many medical institutions have recently begun to provide total colonoscopy (TCS) as an initial screening program. However, there are a number of severe risks associated with TCS, such as colorectal bleeding and perforation. The justification for performing such a procedure on healthy patients remains unclear. We used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to investigate whether risk information on TCS affects patient preferences for colorectal cancer screening. We performed a questionnaire survey using an AHP decision-making model, targeting 285 people aged 40\u201359 years. We randomly assigned the subjects into Groups A (n = 146) and B (n = 139). Both groups were provided with information on the effectiveness, cost and disadvantages of the two screening programs. Group A was provided with additional information regarding the risks of TCS. Individual priorities were calculated with pair-wise comparisons between the two alternatives in each selection criteria. The influence of the risk information was analyzed using a logistic regression analysis. The aggregated priorities in Group A for 'effectiveness', 'costs', and 'risks' were 0.603, 0.147, and 0.250, respectively, while those in Group B were 0.652, 0.149, and 0.199, respectively. A logistic regression analysis showed that the provision of risk information significantly reduced the subjects' priorities for TCS (p = 0.036). The lack of risk information was related to the differences in priorities assigned to effectiveness and risks of the two procedures. Patients must be well informed before making decisions concerning their preferred colorectal cancer screening procedure.\n\nAuthors: Yuichi Katsumura, Hideo Yasunaga, Tomoaki Imamura, Kazuhiko Ohe, Hiroshi Oyama",
          "Recombination Difference between Sexes: A Role for Haploid Selection\n\nWhy the autosomal recombination rate differs between female and male meiosis in most species has been a genetic enigma since the early study of meiosis. Some hypotheses have been put forward to explain this widespread phenomenon and, up to now, only one fact has emerged clearly: In species in which meiosis is achiasmate in one sex, it is the heterogametic one. This pattern, known as the Haldane-Huxley rule, is thought to be a side effect, on autosomes, of the suppression of recombination between the sex chromosomes. However, this rule does not hold for heterochiasmate species (i.e., species in which recombination is present in both sexes but varies quantitatively between sexes) and does not apply to species lacking sex chromosomes, such as hermaphroditic plants. In this paper, we show that in plants, heterochiasmy is due to a male-female difference in gametic selection and is not influenced by the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This finding provides strong empirical support in favour of a population genetic explanation for the evolution of heterochiasmy and, more broadly, for the evolution of sex and recombination.\n\nAuthors: Thomas Lenormand, Julien Dutheil",

          "Diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of clinical and laboratory parameters in community-acquired pneumonia\n\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most frequent infection-related cause of death. The reference standard to diagnose CAP is a new infiltrate on chest radiograph in the presence of recently acquired respiratory signs and symptoms. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory biomarkers for CAP. 545 patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection, admitted to the emergency department of a university hospital were included in a pre-planned post-hoc analysis of two controlled intervention trials. Baseline assessment included history, clinical examination, radiography and measurements of procalcitonin (PCT), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and leukocyte count. Of the 545 patients, 373 had CAP, 132 other respiratory tract infections, and 40 other final diagnoses. The AUC of a clinical model including standard clinical signs and symptoms (i.e. fever, cough, sputum production, abnormal chest auscultation and dyspnea) to diagnose CAP was 0.79 [95% CI, 0.75\u20130.83]. This AUC was significantly improved by including PCT and hsCRP (0.92 [0.89\u20130.94]; p < 0.001). PCT had a higher diagnostic accuracy (AUC, 0.88 [0.84\u20130.93]) in differentiating CAP from other diagnoses, as compared to hsCRP (AUC, 0.76 [0.69\u20130.83]; p < 0.001) and total leukocyte count (AUC, 0.69 [0.62\u20130.77]; p < 0.001). To predict bacteremia, PCT had a higher AUC (0.85 [0.80\u20130.91]) as compared to hsCRP (p = 0.01), leukocyte count (p = 0.002) and elevated body temperature (p < 0.001). PCT, in contrast to hsCRP and leukocyte count, increased with increasing severity of CAP, as assessed by the pneumonia severity index (p < 0.001). PCT, and to a lesser degree hsCRP, improve the accuracy of currently recommended approaches for the diagnosis of CAP, thereby complementing clinical signs and symptoms. PCT is useful in the severity assessment of CAP.\n\nAuthors: Beat M\u00fcller, Stephan Harbarth, Daiana Stolz, Roland Bingisser, Christian Mueller, J\u00f6rg Leuppi, Charly Nusbaumer, Michael Tamm, Mirjam Christ-Crain",

          "Differences in service utilization and barriers among Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites with drug use disorders\n\nTreatment for drug use disorders (DUD) can be effective, but only a small proportion of people with DUD seek or receive treatment. Research on racial and ethnic treatment differences and disparities remains unclear. Understanding racial and ethnic differences and disparities in drug treatment is necessary in order to develop a more effective referral system and to improve the accessibility of treatment. The purpose of the current study was to explore the role of race and ethnicity in service utilization. Using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), this study examined racial and ethnic differences in use of 14 types of treatment services for DUD and 27 different treatment barriers among persons who met lifetime criteria for a DUD. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine service utilization and barriers among the racial and ethnic groups, while adjusting for other sociodemographic and clinical variables. Among Blacks, Hispanics and Whites in the overall NESARC sample, approximately 10.5% met criteria for at least one lifetime drug use disorder. Approximately 16.2% of persons with a lifetime DUD received at least one type of service. Overall, this study indicated that Whites were less likely to report receiving help for drug-related problems than Blacks, Blacks used a greater number of different types of services, and no racial and ethnic differences were observed with respect to perceived barriers to drug treatment. However, by examining types of services separately, a complex picture of racial and ethnic differences emerges. Most notably, Whites were most likely to use professional services, whereas Blacks were most likely to use 12-step and clergy. The service use pattern of Hispanics most resembled that of Whites. While structural barriers to accessing treatment were observed, broad-based educational programs and interventions that are appropriately targeted to racial and ethnic groups remains an important area for prevention and treatment.\n\nAuthors: Brian E Perron, Orion P Mowbray, Joseph E Glass, Jorge Delva, Michael G Vaughn, Mathew Owen Howard",

          "Performance of mitochondrial DNA mutations detecting early stage cancer\n\nMutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtgenome) have been associated with cancer and many other disorders. These mutations can be point mutations or deletions, or admixtures (heteroplasmy). The detection of mtDNA mutations in body fluids using resequencing microarrays, which are more sensitive than other sequencing methods, could provide a strategy to measure mutation loads in remote anatomical sites. We determined the mtDNA mutation load in the entire mitochondrial genome of 26 individuals with different early stage cancers (lung, bladder, kidney) and 12 heavy smokers without cancer. MtDNA was sequenced from three matched specimens (blood, tumor and body fluid) from each cancer patient and two matched specimens (blood and sputum) from smokers without cancer. The inherited wildtype sequence in the blood was compared to the sequences present in the tumor and body fluid, detected using the Affymetrix Genechip Using this high-throughput method, 75% of the tumors were found to contain mtDNA mutations, higher than in our previous studies, and 36% of the body fluids from these cancer patients contained mtDNA mutations. Most of the mutations detected were heteroplasmic. A statistically significantly higher heteroplasmy rate occurred in tumor specimens when compared to both body fluid of cancer patients and sputum of controls, and in patient blood compared to blood of controls. Only 2 of the 12 sputum specimens from heavy smokers without cancer (17%) contained mtDNA mutations. Although patient mutations were spread throughout the mtDNA genome in the lung, bladder and kidney series, a statistically significant elevation of tRNA and ND complex mutations was detected in tumors. Our findings indicate comprehensive mtDNA resequencing can be a high-throughput tool for detecting mutations in clinical samples with potential applications for cancer detection, but it is unclear the biological relevance of these detected mitochondrial mutations. Whether the detection of tumor-specific mtDNA mutations in body fluidsy this method will be useful for diagnosis and monitoring applications requires further investigation.\n\nAuthors: John P Jakupciak, Samantha Maragh, Maura E Markowitz, Alissa K Greenberg, Mohammad O Hoque, Anirban Maitra, Peter E Barker, Paul D Wagner, William N Rom, Sudhir Srivastava, David Sidransky, Catherine D O'Connell",

In particular, differential expression for splicing factors, RNA binding/pre-mRNA processing factors and spliceosome related genes were observed, indicating that RNA processing and editing related events may play critical roles in pancreatic tumor development and progression. High expression of insulin growth factor binding protein-1 (Igfbp1) and Serine proteinase inhibitor A1 (Serpina1), and low levels or absence of Wt1 gene expression were exclusive to liver metastatic lesion samples.

A promising nutritional approach suggested by this thematic review is metabolic effect of low glycaemic-index diet. The currently available scientific literature shows that low glycaemic-index diets acutely induce a number of favorable effects, such as a rapid weight loss, decrease of fasting glucose and insulin levels, reduction of circulating triglyceride levels and improvement of blood pressure. The long-term effect of the combination of these changes is at present not known.

          "Tezosentan reduces the microvascular filtration coefficient in isolated lungs from rats subjected to cecum ligation and puncture\n\nWe recently demonstrated that the non-selective endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor blocker tezosentan antagonizes ovine acute lung injury (ALI) following infusion of endotoxin or ET-1 by reducing the enhanced lung microvascular pressure, although we could not exclude the possibility of a simultaneous decline in microvascular permeability. In the present study, our aim was to find out if tezosentan reverses the rise in microvascular filtration coefficient (Kfc) in rat lungs that have been isolated and perfused 12 h after cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) or infusion of ET-1. Wistar rats (n = 42) were subjected to CLP. Postoperatively, rats were randomized to a CLP group (n = 7) and a CLP + tezosentan group (n = 7); the latter received tezosentan 30 mg/kg. A sham-operated group (n = 5) underwent laparotomy without CLP. Twelve hours postoperatively, the lungs were isolated and perfused with blood from similarly treated rats that also were used to assess plasma concentration of ET-1 and protein kinase C\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1) in lung tissue. Additionally, isolated blood perfused lungs from healthy rats were randomized to a control group (n = 8), an ET-1 group (n = 7) subjected to pulmonary arterial injection of ET-1 10 nM, and an ET-1 + tezosentan group (n = 7) that received tezosentan 30 mg/kg.

          "The detection of specific gene rearrangements in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using the polymerase chain reaction.\n\nCharacteristic gene rearrangements are present in most non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). These are usually detected by Southern blotting techniques. In this study, the ability of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement was evaluated. DNA from 14 follicular and 42 diffuse B-cell lymphomas was examined using oligonucleotide primers specific for opposing sides of the IgH gene rearrangement on chromosome 14 (towards conserved VH and JH sequences) and opposing sides of the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation (towards the major breakpoint region of the bcl-2 gene on chromosome 18 and conserved JH sequence on chromosome 14). The t(14;18) translocation was detected in 57% of follicular lymphomas and 21% of diffuse B-cell lymphomas. Clonal IgH gene rearrangements using PCR were detected in 50% follicular and 52% of the diffuse lymphomas. Either or both of these rearrangements were detected in 93% follicular and in 59% of diffuse lymphomas. PCR is a rapid and easy technique that can detect the abnormal rearrangement of the bcl-2 gene and clonal IgH rearrangement, indicating the presence of lymphoma.

Cyclic AMP-BP were higher in tumour than in either adjacent (P less than 0.000001) or distant mucosa (P less than 0.00001). Binding of cAMP in adjacent mucosa was lower than that in distant mucosa (P less than 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the level of binding between tumours arising from different sites in the colon and binding was not related to age or sex of the patient. However, binding was higher in Dukes' B than Dukes' C cancers (P less than 0.005).

The resulting derivative cell line, Me1R MCF-7, was 30-fold resistant to melphalan. Uptake studies demonstrated decreased initial melphalan accumulation in Me1R MCF-7 cells. Inverse-reciprocal plots of initial melphalan uptake revealed a 4-fold decrease in the apparent Vmax of Me1R MCF-7 compared with WT MCF-7 (516 amol cell-1 min-1 vs 2110 amol cell-1 min-1 respectively) as well as a decrease in the apparent Kt (36 microM vs 70 microM respectively). Two amino acid transporters have previously been identified as melphalan transporters: system L, which is sodium-independent and inhibited by 2-amino-bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), and system ASC which is sodium dependent and unaffected by BCH. At low concentrations of melphalan (3-30 microM), 1mM BCH competition eliminated the differences between the two cell lines, thus implicating an alteration of the system L transporter in the transport defect in the resistant cells. Me1R MCF-7 cells were also evaluated for glutathione-mediated detoxification mechanisms associated with melphalan resistance. There was no difference between Me1R MCF-7 and WT MCF-7 in glutathione content, glutathione-S-transferase activity and expression of pi class glutathione S-transferase RNA. In addition, buthionine sulfoximine did not reverse melphalan resistance in Me1R MCF-7 cells. Therefore, Me1R MCF-7 cells provide an in vitro model of transport-mediated melphalan resistance in human breast cancer cells.\n\nAuthors: J. A. Moscow, C. A. Swanson, K. H. Cowan",

This qualitative case study investigated the perceptions of 19 (predominantly female) inner-city school youth about their use of computers and the Internet in a school-based community development project.  Youth working with public health nurses in a school-based community development project communicated with local community members using computer-mediated communication, surveyed peers online, built websites, searched for information online, and prepared project materials using computers and the Internet. Participant observation, semistructured interviews, analysis of online messages, and online- and paper-based surveys were used to gather data about youth\u2019s and adults\u2019 perceptions and use of the technologies. Constant comparison method and between-method triangulation were used in the analysis to satisfy the existence of themes.  Not all youth were interested in working with computers. Some electronic messages from adults were perceived to be critical, and writing to adults was intimidating for some youth. In addition, technical problems were experienced. Despite these barriers, most youth perceived that using computers and the Internet reduced their anxiety concerning communication with adults, increased their control when dealing with adults, raised their perception of their social status, increased participation within the community, supported reflective thought, increased efficiency, and improved their access to resources.  Overall, youth perceived computers and the Internet to be empowering tools, and they should be encouraged to use such technology to support them in community initiatives.\n\nAuthors: Ruta K Valaitis\n\nKeywords: Computers, Internet, adolescent, power, public health, schools, social change",

          "In vivo and in vitro biotransformation of the lithium salt of gamma-linolenic acid by three human carcinomas.\n\nLipid metabolism has been considered recently as a novel target for cancer therapy. In this field, lithium gamma-linolenate (LiGLA) is a promising experimental compound for use in the treatment of human tumours. In vivo and in vitro studies allowed us to assess the metabolism of radiolabelled LiGLA by tumour tissue and different organs of the host. In vitro studies demonstrated that human pancreatic (AsPC-1), prostatic (PC-3) and mammary carcinoma (ZR-75-1) cells were capable of elongating GLA from LiGLA to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and further desaturating it to arachidonic acid (AA). AsPC-1 cells showed the lowest delta5-desaturase activity on DGLA. In the in vivo studies, nude mice bearing the human carcinomas were given Li[1-(14)C]GLA (2.5 mg kg(-1)) by intravenous injection for 30 min. Mice were either sacrificed after infusion or left for up to 96 h recovery before sacrifice. In general, the organs showed a maximum uptake of radioactivity 30 min after the infusion started (t = 0). Thereafter, in major organs the percentage of injected radioactivity per g of tissue declined below 1% 96 h after infusion. In kidney, brain, testes/ovaries and all three tumour tissues, labelling remained constant throughout the experiment. The ratio of radioactivity in liver to tumour tissues ranged between 16- and 24-fold at t = 0 and between 3.1- and 3.7-fold at 96 h. All tissues showed a progressive increase in the proportion of radioactivity associated with AA with a concomitant decrease in radiolabelled GLA as the time after infusion increased. DGLA declined rapidly in liver and plasma, but at a much slower rate in brain and malignant tissue. Seventy-two hours after the infusion, GLA was only detected in plasma and tumour tissue. The sum of GLA + DGLA varied among tumour tissues, but it remained 2-4 times higher than in liver and plasma. In brain, DGLA is the major contributor to the sum of these fatty acids. Data showed that cytotoxic GLA and DGLA, the latter provided either by the host or by endogenous synthesis, remained in human tumours for at least 4 days.\n\nAuthors: R. de Antueno, M. Elliot, G.

          "Pathophysiology of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\n\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a major cause of idiopathic steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). In recent years, animal models and studies of familial forms of nephrotic syndrome helped elucidate some mechanisms of podocyte injury and disease progression in FSGS. This article reviews some of the experimental and clinical data on the pathophysiology of FSGS.\n\nAuthors: Kimberly Reidy, Frederick J.

          "Pathway analysis of kidney cancer using proteomics and metabolic profiling\n\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the sixth leading cause of cancer death and is responsible for 11,000 deaths per year in the US. Approximately one-third of patients present with disease which is already metastatic and for which there is currently no adequate treatment, and no biofluid screening tests exist for RCC. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive proteomic analysis and subsequently a pathway and network approach to identify biological processes involved in clear cell RCC (ccRCC). We have used these data to investigate urinary markers of RCC which could be applied to high-risk patients, or to those being followed for recurrence, for early diagnosis and treatment, thereby substantially reducing mortality of this disease. Using 2-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analysis, we identified 31 proteins which were differentially expressed with a high degree of significance in ccRCC as compared to adjacent non-malignant tissue, and we confirmed some of these by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and comparison to published transcriptomic data. When evaluated by several pathway and biological process analysis programs, these proteins are demonstrated to be involved with a high degree of confidence (p values < 2.0 E-05) in glycolysis, propanoate metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, urea cycle and arginine/proline metabolism, as well as in the non-metabolic p53 and FAS pathways. In a pilot study using random urine samples from both ccRCC and control patients, we performed metabolic profiling and found that only sorbitol, a component of an alternative glycolysis pathway, is significantly elevated at 5.4-fold in RCC patients as compared to controls. Extensive pathway and network analysis allowed for the discovery of highly significant pathways from a set of clear cell RCC samples. Knowledge of activation of these processes will lead to novel assays identifying their proteomic and/or metabolomic signatures in biofluids of patient at high risk for this disease; we provide pilot data for such a urinary bioassay. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the knowledge of networks, processes, and pathways altered in kidney cancer may be used to influence the choice of optimal therapy.\n\nAuthors: Bertrand Perroud, Jinoo Lee, Nelly Valkova, Amy Dhirapong, Pei-Yin Lin, Oliver Fiehn, Dietmar K\u00fcltz, Robert H Weiss",

          "Progressive multiple sequence alignments from triplets\n\nThe quality of progressive sequence alignments strongly depends on the accuracy of the individual pairwise alignment steps since gaps that are introduced at one step cannot be removed at later aggregation steps. Adjacent insertions and deletions necessarily appear in arbitrary order in pairwise alignments and hence form an unavoidable source of errors. Here we present a modified variant of progressive sequence alignments that addresses both issues. Instead of pairwise alignments we use exact dynamic programming to align sequence or profile triples. This avoids a large fractions of the ambiguities arising in pairwise alignments. In the subsequent aggregation steps we follow the logic of the Neighbor-Net algorithm, which constructs a phylogenetic network by step-wisely replacing triples by pairs instead of combining pairs to singletons. To this end the three-way alignments are subdivided into two partial alignments, at which stage all-gap columns are naturally removed. This alleviates the \"once a gap, always a gap\" problem of progressive alignment procedures. The three-way Neighbor-Net based alignment program aln3nn is shown to compare favorably on both protein sequences and nucleic acids sequences to other progressive alignment tools. In the latter case one easily can include scoring terms that consider secondary structure features. Overall, the quality of resulting alignments in general exceeds that of clustalw or other multiple alignments tools even though our software does not included heuristics for context dependent (mis)match scores.\n\nAuthors: Matthias Kruspe, Peter F Stadler",

          "Multilevel examination of minor salivary gland biopsy for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome significantly improves diagnostic performance of AECG classification criteria\n\nThe recently observed low reproducibility of focus score (FS) assessment at different section depths in a series of single minor salivary gland biopsies highlighted the need for a standardized protocol of extensive histopathological examination of such biopsies in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. For this purpose, a cumulative focus score (cFS) was evaluated on three slides cut at 200-\u03bcm intervals from each of a series of 120 salivary biopsies. The cFS was substituted for the baseline FS in the American\u2013European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria set for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome classification, and then test specificity and sensitivity were assessed against clinical patient re-evaluation. Test performances of the AECG classification with the original FS and the score obtained after multilevel examination were statistically compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The diagnostic performance of AECG classification significantly improved when the cFS was entered in the AECG classification; the improvement was mostly due to increased specificity in biopsies with a baseline FS \u2265 1 but <2. The assessment of a cFS obtained at three different section levels on minor salivary gland biopsies can be useful especially in biopsies with baseline FSs between 1 and 2.\n\nAuthors: Patrizia Morbini, Antonio Manzo, Roberto Caporali, Oscar Epis, Chiara Villa, Carmine Tinelli, Enrico Solcia, Carlomaurizio Montecucco\n\nKeywords: focus score, minor salivary gland biopsy, multilevel examination, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome",

          "Recent Origin and Cultural Reversion of a Hunter\u2013Gatherer Group\n\nContemporary hunter\u2013gatherer groups are often thought to serve as models of an ancient lifestyle that was typical of human populations prior to the development of agriculture. Patterns of genetic variation in hunter\u2013gatherer groups such as the !Kung and African Pygmies are consistent with this view, as they exhibit low genetic diversity coupled with high frequencies of divergent mtDNA types not found in surrounding agricultural groups, suggesting long-term isolation and small population sizes. We report here genetic evidence concerning the origins of the Mlabri, an enigmatic hunter\u2013gatherer group from northern Thailand. The Mlabri have no mtDNA diversity, and the genetic diversity at Y-chromosome and autosomal loci are also extraordinarily reduced in the Mlabri. Genetic, linguistic, and cultural data all suggest that the Mlabri were recently founded, 500\u2013800 y ago, from a very small number of individuals. Moreover, the Mlabri appear to have originated from an agricultural group and then adopted a hunting\u2013gathering subsistence mode. This example of cultural reversion from agriculture to a hunting\u2013gathering lifestyle indicates that contemporary hunter\u2013gatherer groups do not necessarily reflect a pre-agricultural lifestyle.\n\nAuthors: Hiroki Oota, Brigitte Pakendorf, Gunter Weiss, Arndt von Haeseler, Surin Pookajorn, Wannapa Settheetham-Ishida, Danai Tiwawech, Takafumi Ishida, Mark Stoneking",

          "Genome-wide screening of the genes required for tolerance to vanillin, which is a potential inhibitor of bioethanol fermentation, in \n\nLignocellulosic materials are abundant and among the most important potential sources for bioethanol production. Although the pretreatment of lignocellulose is necessary for efficient saccharification and fermentation, numerous by-products, including furan derivatives, weak acids, and phenolic compounds, are generated in the pretreatment step. Many of these components inhibit the growth and fermentation of yeast. In particular, vanillin is one of the most effective inhibitors in lignocellulose hydrolysates because it inhibits fermentation at very low concentrations. To identify the genes required for tolerance to vanillin, we screened a set of diploid yeast deletion mutants, which are powerful tools for clarifying the function of particular genes. Seventy-six deletion mutants were identified as vanillin-sensitive mutants. The numerous deleted genes in the vanillin-sensitive mutants were classified under the functional categories for 'chromatin remodeling' and 'vesicle transport', suggesting that these functions are important for vanillin tolerance. The cross-sensitivity of the vanillin-sensitive mutants to furan derivatives, weak acids, and phenolic compounds was also examined. Genes for ergosterol biosynthesis were required for tolerance to all inhibitory compounds tested, suggesting that ergosterol is a key component of tolerance to various inhibitors. Our analysis predicts that vanillin tolerance in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n\nAuthors: Ayako Endo, Toshihide Nakamura, Akira Ando, Ken Tokuyasu, Jun Shima",

          "Laparoscopy in the management of pediatric vesicoureteral reflux\n\nThe prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been estimated as. 4 to 1.8% among the pediatric population. In children with urinary tract infection the prevalence is typically from 30-50% with higher incidence occurring in infancy. When correction of VUR is determined to be necessary, traditionally open ureteral reimplantation by a variety of techniques has been the mainstay of treatment. This approach is justified because surgical correction affords a very high success rate of 99% in experienced hands and a low complication rate. In that context the purpose of this review article is to highlight the use of laparoscopy and robot-assisted techniques to perform ureteric reimplantation for the management of pediatric VUR. A detailed review of recent literature on the subject is performed to find out various aspects of minimally invasive surgery in the treatment of VUR, highlighting evolution of management approaches, operative steps, complications, results and the current status in clinical practice.

          "Recombination Difference between Sexes: A Role for Haploid Selection\n\nWhy the autosomal recombination rate differs between female and male meiosis in most species has been a genetic enigma since the early study of meiosis. Some hypotheses have been put forward to explain this widespread phenomenon and, up to now, only one fact has emerged clearly: In species in which meiosis is achiasmate in one sex, it is the heterogametic one. This pattern, known as the Haldane-Huxley rule, is thought to be a side effect, on autosomes, of the suppression of recombination between the sex chromosomes. However, this rule does not hold for heterochiasmate species (i.e., species in which recombination is present in both sexes but varies quantitatively between sexes) and does not apply to species lacking sex chromosomes, such as hermaphroditic plants. In this paper, we show that in plants, heterochiasmy is due to a male-female difference in gametic selection and is not influenced by the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This finding provides strong empirical support in favour of a population genetic explanation for the evolution of heterochiasmy and, more broadly, for the evolution of sex and recombination.\n\nAuthors: Thomas Lenormand, Julien Dutheil",
          "Modelling the Impact of Antiretroviral Use in Resource-Poor Settings\n\nThe anticipated scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in high-prevalence, resource-constrained settings requires operational research to guide policy on the design of treatment programmes. Mathematical models can explore the potential impacts of various treatment strategies, including timing of treatment initiation and provision of laboratory monitoring facilities, to complement evidence from pilot programmes. A deterministic model of HIV transmission incorporating ART and stratifying infection progression into stages was constructed. The impact of ART was evaluated for various scenarios and treatment strategies, with different levels of coverage, patient eligibility, and other parameter values. These strategies included the provision of laboratory facilities that perform CD4 counts and viral load testing, and the timing of the stage of infection at which treatment is initiated. In our analysis, unlimited ART provision initiated at late-stage infection (AIDS) increased prevalence of HIV infection. The effect of additionally treating pre-AIDS patients depended on the behaviour change of treated patients. Different coverage levels for ART do not affect benefits such as life-years gained per person-year of treatment and have minimal effect on infections averted when treating AIDS patients only. Scaling up treatment of pre-AIDS patients resulted in more infections being averted per person-year of treatment, but the absolute number of infections averted remained small. As coverage increased in the models, the emergence and risk of spread of drug resistance increased. Withdrawal of failing treatment (clinical resurgence of symptoms), immunologic (CD4 count decline), or virologic failure (viral rebound) increased the number of infected individuals who could benefit from ART, but effectiveness per person is compromised. Only withdrawal at a very early stage of treatment failure, soon after viral rebound, would have a substantial impact on emergence of drug resistance. Our analysis found that ART cannot be seen as a direct transmission prevention measure, regardless of the degree of coverage. Counselling of patients to promote safe sexual practices is essential and must aim to effect long-term change. The chief aims of an ART programme, such as maximised number of patients treated or optimised treatment per patient, will determine which treatment strategy is most effective.\n\nAuthors: Rebecca F Baggaley, Geoff P Garnett, Neil M Ferguson"

The present survey aimed at examining the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other disorders and symptoms, all present in old age, as long-term consequences of politically motivated violence in a comparison design. A group of former political detainees (N = 59, mean age 73.5 years) who had been arrested by the Romanian communist regime were compared to an age- and gender-matched control group (N = 39). PTSD was assessed using a structured clinical interview (CIDI). The investigation of the clinical profile was further accomplished by self-rating measures for anxiety, depression, and health-related functioning, as well as by clinician-administrated interviews for substance abuse, dissociation, and somatization symptoms. Lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 54%. In the case of participants left untreated, PTSD persisted, often over four decades, such that current PTSD was diagnosed still in a third of the survivors. Other clinical conditions such as somatization, substance abuse, dissociative disorders, and major depression were also common among the former political detainees and often associated with current PTSD. Our findings suggest that political detention may have long-term psychological consequences that outlast the changes in the political system.\n\nAuthors: Dana Bichescu, Maggie Schauer, Evangelia Saleptsi, Adrian Neculau, Thomas Elbert, Frank Neuner",
          "What makes people decide who to turn to when faced with a mental health problem? Results from a French survey\n\nThe unequal use of mental health care is a great issue, even in countries with universal health coverage. Better knowledge of the factors that have an impact on the pathway to mental health care may be a great help for designing education campaigns and for best organizing health care delivery. The objective of this study is to explore the determinants of help-seeking intentions for mental health problems and which factors influence treatment opinions and the reliance on and compliance with health professionals' advice. 441 adults aged 18 to 70 were randomly selected from the general population of two suburban districts near Paris and agreed to participate in the study (response rate = 60.4%). The 412 respondents with no mental health problems based on the CIDI-SF and the CAGE, who had not consulted for a mental health problem in the previous year, were asked in detail about their intentions to seek help in case of a psychological disorder and about their opinion of mental health treatments. The links between the respondents' characteristics and intentions and opinions were explored. More than half of the sample (57.8%) would see their general practitioner (GP) first and 46.6% would continue with their GP for follow-up. Mental health professionals were mentioned far less than GPs. People who would choose their GP first were older and less educated, whereas those who would favor mental health specialists had lower social support. For psychotherapy, respondents were split equally between seeing a GP, a psychiatrist or a psychologist. People were reluctant to take psychotropic drugs, but looked favorably on psychotherapy. GPs are often the point of entry into the mental health care system and need to be supported. Public information campaigns about mental health care options and treatments are needed to educate the public, eliminate the stigma of mental illness and eliminate prejudices.\n\nAuthors: Viviane Kovess-Masf\u00e9ty, Delphine Saragoussi, Christine Sevilla-Dedieu, Fabien Gilbert, Agnieszka Suchocka, Nathalie Arveiller, Isabelle Gasquet, Nadia Younes, Marie-Christine Hardy-Bayle",

          "Another explanation for the low allergy rate in the rural Alpine foothills\n\nA low allergy rate in coal and wood heated homes has been described in the small villages in the Alpine foothills and subsequently found to be associated with the farming environment. This was interpreted within the framework of the hygiene hypothesis but there are also alternative explanations. Lower air pollution could be one reason, which is, however, unlikely since the differences between the Bavarian countryside and the Munich municipal area were only weak. There could be genetic differences between the urban and rural population by previous isolation or by self-selection. The potential drop-out of allergy genes, however, will also not explain the absent increase of allergies in two generations. More likely, other lifestyle factors are important. Dietary habits are different in farmers and a less frequent vitamin D supplementation of newborns (otherwise expected to be allergy promoting) has been shown recently. The underlying cause for the \"non-allergic farm child\" remains speculative until the transfer of any farm-associated factor is leading to a similar risk reduction in the general population.\n\nAuthors: Matthias Wjst",

          "Does Prior Training Affect Acute O\n\nThis study investigated the effects of a prior individualized training program (TP) on the response to acute oxygen supply during exercise in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients showing exercise-induced desaturation. Twenty-two COPD patients (mean [SD] FEV1 = 52.1 [3]% predicted) who desaturated on exercise participated in a TP. Exercise tolerance while breathing compressed air or oxygen was assessed using a walking test (WT) before and after TP. Oxygen flow was individualized. Before TP, acute oxygen supply improved mean exercise tolerance. But this response was heterogeneous as only 8 patients increased their walking distance with oxygen. TP improved exercise tolerance in the entire population. However, a greater affect of oxygen administration during exercise was not observed after TP. The response to oxygen again showed great disparity as only 6 patients increased their walking distance with oxygen after TP. The response to oxygen supply during exercise varied among COPD patients. Moreover, despite the clinical benefits of TP, no cumulative effect of TP and oxygen supply was observed during exercise performance.\n\nAuthors: Delphine Delample, Meritxell Sabate, Christian Pr\u00e9faut, Fabienne Durand\n\nKeywords: COPD, training program, oxygen, exercise.",

          "Transcriptomic identification of candidate genes involved in sunflower responses to chilling and salt stresses based on cDNA microarray analysis\n\nConsidering that sunflower production is expanding to arid regions, tolerance to abiotic stresses as drought, low temperatures and salinity arises as one of the main constrains nowadays. Differential organ-specific sunflower ESTs (expressed sequence tags) were previously generated by a subtractive hybridization method that included a considerable number of putative abiotic stress associated sequences. The objective of this work is to analyze concerted gene expression profiles of organ-specific ESTs by fluorescence microarray assay, in response to high sodium chloride concentration and chilling treatments with the aim to identify and follow up candidate genes for early responses to abiotic stress in sunflower. Abiotic-related expressed genes were the target of this characterization through a gene expression analysis using an organ-specific cDNA fluorescence microarray approach in response to high salinity and low temperatures. The experiment included three independent replicates from leaf samples. We analyzed 317 unigenes previously isolated from differential organ-specific cDNA libraries from leaf, stem and flower at R1 and R4 developmental stage. A statistical analysis based on mean comparison by ANOVA and ordination by Principal Component Analysis allowed the detection of 80 candidate genes for either salinity and/or chilling stresses. Out of them, 50 genes were up or down regulated under both stresses, supporting common regulatory mechanisms and general responses to chilling and salinity. Interestingly 15 and 12 sequences were up regulated or down regulated specifically in one stress but not in the other, respectively. These genes are potentially involved in different regulatory mechanisms including transcription/translation/protein degradation/protein folding/ROS production or ROS-scavenging. Differential gene expression patterns were confirmed by qRT-PCR for 12.5% of the microarray candidate sequences. Eighty genes isolated from organ-specific cDNA libraries were identified as candidate genes for sunflower early response to low temperatures and salinity. Microarray profiling of chilling and NaCl-treated sunflower leaves revealed dynamic changes in transcript abundance, including transcription factors, defense/stress related proteins, and effectors of homeostasis, all of which highlight the complexity of both stress responses. This study not only allowed the identification of common transcriptional changes to both stress conditions but also lead to the detection of stress-specific genes not previously reported in sunflower. This is the first organ-specific cDNA fluorescence microarray study addressing a simultaneous evaluation of concerted transcriptional changes in response to chilling and salinity stress in cultivated sunflower.\n\nAuthors: Paula Fernandez, Julio Di Rienzo, Luis Fernandez, H Esteban Hopp, Norma Paniego, Ruth A Heinz",
          "Recombination Difference between Sexes: A Role for Haploid Selection\n\nWhy the autosomal recombination rate differs between female and male meiosis in most species has been a genetic enigma since the early study of meiosis. Some hypotheses have been put forward to explain this widespread phenomenon and, up to now, only one fact has emerged clearly: In species in which meiosis is achiasmate in one sex, it is the heterogametic one. This pattern, known as the Haldane-Huxley rule, is thought to be a side effect, on autosomes, of the suppression of recombination between the sex chromosomes. However, this rule does not hold for heterochiasmate species (i.e., species in which recombination is present in both sexes but varies quantitatively between sexes) and does not apply to species lacking sex chromosomes, such as hermaphroditic plants. In this paper, we show that in plants, heterochiasmy is due to a male-female difference in gametic selection and is not influenced by the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This finding provides strong empirical support in favour of a population genetic explanation for the evolution of heterochiasmy and, more broadly, for the evolution of sex and recombination.\n\nAuthors: Thomas Lenormand, Julien Dutheil",

          "A follow-up study of heroin addicts (VEdeTTE2): study design and protocol\n\nIn Italy, a large cohort study (VEdeTTE1) was conducted between 1998\u20132001 to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments in reducing mortality and increasing treatment retention among heroin addicts. The follow-up of this cohort (VEdeTTE2) was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments on long-term outcomes, such as rehabilitation and social re-integration. The purpose of this paper is to describe the protocol of the VEdeTTE2 study, and to present the results of the pilot study carried out to assess the feasibility of the study and to improve study procedures. The source population for the VEdeTTE2 study was the VEdeTTE1 cohort, from which a sample of 2,200 patients, traced two or more years after enrolment in the cohort, were asked to participate. An interview investigates drug use; overdose; family and social re-integration. Illegal activity are investigated separately in a questionnaire completed by the patient. Patients are also asked to provide a hair sample to test for heroin and cocaine use. Information on treatments and HIV, HBV and HCV morbidity are obtained from clinical records. A pilot phase was planned and carried out on 60 patients. The results of the pilot phase pointed out the validity of the procedures designed to limit attrition: the number of traced subjects was satisfactory (88%). Moreover, the pilot phase was very useful in identifying possible causes of delays and attrition, and flaws in the instruments. Improvements to the procedures and the instruments were subsequently implemented. Sensitivity of the biological test was quite good for heroin (78%) but lower for cocaine (42.3%), highlighting the need to obtain a hair sample from all patients. In drug addiction research, studies investigating health status and social re-integration of subjects at long-term follow-up are lacking. The VEdeTTE2 study aims to investigate these outcomes at long-term follow-up. Results of the pilot phase underline the importance of the pilot phase when planning a follow-up study.\n\nAuthors: Federica D Vigna-Taglianti, Federica Mathis, Roberto Diecidue, Paola Burroni, Antonio Iannaccone, Fabio Lampis, Piergiorgio Zuccaro, Roberta Pacifici, Elisabetta Versino, Marina Davoli, Fabrizio Faggiano",
          "Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in a High HIV Prevalence Population Provided with Enhanced Diagnosis of Symptomatic Disease \n\nDirectly observed treatment short course (DOTS), the global control strategy aimed at controlling tuberculosis (TB) transmission through prompt diagnosis of symptomatic smear-positive disease, has failed to prevent rising tuberculosis incidence rates in Africa brought about by the HIV epidemic. However, rising incidence does not necessarily imply failure to control tuberculosis transmission, which is primarily driven by prevalent infectious disease. We investigated the epidemiology of prevalent and incident TB in a high HIV prevalence population provided with enhanced primary health care. Twenty-two businesses in Harare, Zimbabwe, were provided with free smear- and culture-based investigation of TB symptoms through occupational clinics. Anonymised HIV tests were requested from all employees. After 2 y of follow-up for incident TB, a culture-based survey for undiagnosed prevalent TB was conducted. A total of 6,440 of 7,478 eligible employees participated. HIV prevalence was 19%. For HIV-positive and -negative participants, the incidence of culture-positive tuberculosis was 25.3 and 1.3 per 1,000 person-years, respectively (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 18.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.3 to 34.5: population attributable fraction = 78%), and point prevalence after 2 y was 5.7 and 2.6 per 1,000 population (adjusted odds ratio = 1.7; 95% CI = 0.5 to 6.8: population attributable fraction = 14%). Most patients with prevalent culture-positive TB had subclinical disease when first detected. Strategies based on prompt investigation of TB symptoms, such as DOTS, may be an effective way of controlling prevalent TB in high HIV prevalence populations. This may translate into effective control of TB transmission despite high TB incidence rates and a period of subclinical infectiousness in some patients.\n\nAuthors: Elizabeth L Corbett, Tsitsi Bandason, Yin Bun Cheung, Shungu Munyati, Peter Godfrey-Faussett, Richard Hayes, Gavin Churchyard, Anthony Butterworth, Peter Mason",
          "Highly Nonrandom Features of Synaptic Connectivity in Local Cortical Circuits\n\nHow different is local cortical circuitry from a random network? To answer this question, we probed synaptic connections with several hundred simultaneous quadruple whole-cell recordings from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat visual cortex. Analysis of this dataset revealed several nonrandom features in synaptic connectivity. We confirmed previous reports that bidirectional connections are more common than expected in a random network. We found that several highly clustered three-neuron connectivity patterns are overrepresented, suggesting that connections tend to cluster together. We also analyzed synaptic connection strength as defined by the peak excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude. We found that the distribution of synaptic connection strength differs significantly from the Poisson distribution and can be fitted by a lognormal distribution. Such a distribution has a heavier tail and implies that synaptic weight is concentrated among few synaptic connections. In addition, the strengths of synaptic connections sharing pre- or postsynaptic neurons are correlated, implying that strong connections are even more clustered than the weak ones. Therefore, the local cortical network structure can be viewed as a skeleton of stronger connections in a sea of weaker ones. Such a skeleton is likely to play an important role in network dynamics and should be investigated further.\n\nAuthors: Sen Song, Per Jesper Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Markus Reigl, Sacha Nelson, Dmitri B Chklovskii",

          "We applied a combined experimental and computational approach to ascertain how peptides interact with host and microbial membrane surrogates, in order to validate simulation methodology we hope will enable the development of insights applicable to the design of novel antimicrobial peptides. We studied the interactions of two truncated versions of the potent, but cytotoxic, antimicrobial octadecapeptide protegrin-1, PC-72 [LCYCRRRFCVC] and PC-73 [CYCRRRFCVC]. We used a combination of FTIR, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to examine the peptides' interactions with sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. The relative amounts of secondary structure determined by FTIR agreed with those from the simulations. Fluorescence spectroscopy, deuterium exchange experiments and the simulations all indicate that neither peptide embeds itself deeply into the micelle core. Although molecular simulations placed both peptides at the micelle-water interface, further examination revealed differences in how certain residues interacted with the micelle core. We demonstrate here the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations methods through comparison with experiments, and have used the simulation results to enhance the understanding of how these two peptides interact with the two types of micelles. We find agreement between simulation and experimental results in the final structure of the peptides and in the peptides final conformation with respect to the micelle. Looking in depth at the peptide interactions, we find differences in the interactions between the two peptides from the simulation data; Leu-1 on PC-72 interacts strongly with the SDS micelle, though the interaction is not persistent \u2013 the residue withdraws and inserts into the micelle throughout the simulation.",
          "The breastfeeding experience of women with major difficulties who use the services of a breastfeeding clinic: a descriptive study\n\nMany women experience breastfeeding difficulties. Sometimes these difficulties lead to breastfeeding cessation. Breastfeeding clinics provide support for women facing such problems. This study aims to describe the breastfeeding experience of women, particularly those who use the services of the breastfeeding clinic located in the Greater Quebec City area. This is a descriptive study based on information gathered through telephone questionnaires that were administered in 2006 to a sample of 86 women and semi-structured interviews conducted with 12 of these women. Painful nipples/breasts, low milk supply and latching difficulties were the three most frequent major breastfeeding problems identified by women. Their personal characteristics as well as the moral and physical support provided by family and friends and by health professional and clinicians at the breastfeeding clinic were the factors identified most often as having a positive influence on the breastfeeding experience.

          "Reductionist and system approaches to study the role of infection in preterm labor and delivery\n\nA substantial number of patients with preterm labor and delivery do not show clinical signs of infection, however, it is the subclinical form which is the main causative factor and often results in premature delivery. The hitherto commonly applied methods of inflammation detection are based either on potentially hazardous amniocentesis or still insufficient inflammation-related protein measurement in the serum or other biological fluids. The advent of new \"omics\" technologies has led to a paradigm-shift in experimental approach which tends to primarily generate rather than form hypotheses. This has resulted in a surge of wealth of data composed of sets of individual or clusters of new genes and proteins that can be of potential importance as new markers of inflammation leading to preterm labor. It is hoped that as a result of those new methodologies the overall perception of medical research and practice would gradually change from reductionist to systems approach. Despite several successes of reductionism in the diagnosis and treatment of preterm labor it seems that system-based methodology would contribute to a more favorable personalized rather than one-for-all patient assistance.

          "Highly Nonrandom Features of Synaptic Connectivity in Local Cortical Circuits\n\nHow different is local cortical circuitry from a random network? To answer this question, we probed synaptic connections with several hundred simultaneous quadruple whole-cell recordings from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat visual cortex. Analysis of this dataset revealed several nonrandom features in synaptic connectivity. We confirmed previous reports that bidirectional connections are more common than expected in a random network. We found that several highly clustered three-neuron connectivity patterns are overrepresented, suggesting that connections tend to cluster together. We also analyzed synaptic connection strength as defined by the peak excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude. We found that the distribution of synaptic connection strength differs significantly from the Poisson distribution and can be fitted by a lognormal distribution. Such a distribution has a heavier tail and implies that synaptic weight is concentrated among few synaptic connections. In addition, the strengths of synaptic connections sharing pre- or postsynaptic neurons are correlated, implying that strong connections are even more clustered than the weak ones. Therefore, the local cortical network structure can be viewed as a skeleton of stronger connections in a sea of weaker ones. Such a skeleton is likely to play an important role in network dynamics and should be investigated further.\n\nAuthors: Sen Song, Per Jesper Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Markus Reigl, Sacha Nelson, Dmitri B Chklovskii",
          "BRIP1 (BACH1) variants and familial breast cancer risk: a case-control study\n\nInactivating and truncating mutations of the nuclear BRCA1-interacting protein 1 (BRIP1) have been shown to be the major cause of Fanconi anaemia and, due to subsequent alterations of BRCA1 function, predispose to breast cancer (BC). We investigated the effect of BRIP1 -64G>A and Pro919Ser on familial BC risk by means of TaqMan allelic discrimination, analysing  BRCA1/BRCA2  No significant differences in genotype frequencies between BC cases and controls for BRIP1 -64G>A and Pro919Ser were observed. We found no effect of the putatively functional BRIP1 variants -64G>A and Pro919Ser on the risk of familial BC.\n\nAuthors: Bernd Frank, Kari Hemminki, Alfons Meindl, Barbara Wappenschmidt, Christian Sutter, Marion Kiechle, Peter Bugert, Rita K Schmutzler, Claus R Bartram, Barbara Burwinkel",

          "The TyrA family of aromatic-pathway dehydrogenases in phylogenetic context\n\nThe TyrA protein family includes members that catalyze two dehydrogenase reactions in distinct pathways leading to L-tyrosine and a third reaction that is not part of tyrosine biosynthesis. Family members share a catalytic core region of about 30 kDa, where inhibitors operate competitively by acting as substrate mimics. This protein family typifies many that are challenging for bioinformatic analysis because of relatively modest sequence conservation and small size. Phylogenetic relationships of TyrA domains were evaluated in the context of combinatorial patterns of specificity for the two substrates, as well as the presence or absence of a variety of fusions. An interactive tool is provided for prediction of substrate specificity. Interactive alignments for a suite of catalytic-core TyrA domains of differing specificity are also provided to facilitate phylogenetic analysis.  tyrA  Bacteria hisH b aroF aroQ tyrA We propose that the ancestral TyrA dehydrogenase had broad specificity for both the cyclohexadienyl and pyridine nucleotide substrates. Indeed, TyrA proteins of this type persist today, but it is also common to find instances of narrowed substrate specificities, as well as of acquisition via gene fusion of additional catalytic domains or regulatory domains. In some clades a qualitative change associated with either narrowed substrate specificity or gene fusion has produced an evolutionary \"jump\" in the vertical genealogy of TyrA homologs.

          "ParaKMeans: Implementation of a parallelized K-means algorithm suitable for general laboratory use\n\nDuring the last decade, the use of microarrays to assess the transcriptome of many biological systems has generated an enormous amount of data. A common technique used to organize and analyze microarray data is to perform cluster analysis. While many clustering algorithms have been developed, they all suffer a significant decrease in computational performance as the size of the dataset being analyzed becomes very large. For example, clustering 10000 genes from an experiment containing 200 microarrays can be quite time consuming and challenging on a desktop PC. One solution to the scalability problem of clustering algorithms is to distribute or parallelize the algorithm across multiple computers. The software described in this paper is a high performance multithreaded application that implements a parallelized version of the K-means Clustering algorithm. Most parallel processing applications are not accessible to the general public and require specialized software libraries (e.g. MPI) and specialized hardware configurations. The parallel nature of the application comes from the use of a web service to perform the distance calculations and cluster assignments. Here we show our parallel implementation provides significant performance gains over a wide range of datasets using as little as seven nodes. The software was written in C# and was designed in a modular fashion to provide both deployment flexibility as well as flexibility in the user interface. ParaKMeans was designed to provide the general scientific community with an easy and manageable client-server application that can be installed on a wide variety of Windows operating systems.\n\nAuthors: Piotr Kraj, Ashok Sharma, Nikhil Garge, Robert Podolsky, Richard A McIndoe",
