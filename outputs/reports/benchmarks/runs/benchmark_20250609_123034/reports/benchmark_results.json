Recent incursion and distribution of EHDV in Europe have outlined the need for vaccine research against this viral disease. In this work, we report modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-vectored vaccines designed to express protein VP2 of EHDV-8 or protein VP7 of EHDV-2. Prime boost immunization of adult IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice with the MVA-VP2 vaccine candidate induced high titers of EHDV-8-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and conferred full protection against homologous lethal challenge with EHDV-8. However, no heterologous protection was observed after lethal challenge with EHDV-6. In contrast, the MVA-VP7 vaccine candidate elicited strong cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell responses against VP7 and conferred complete protection against lethal challenge with either EHDV-8 or EHDV-6 in IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice in the absence of NAbs, being the first multiserotype vaccine candidate against EHDV. Moreover, we expressed recombinant proteins VP2 and VP7 of EHDV in the baculovirus expression system, which were used to analyze the potential DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) character of these vaccine candidates. Emergence and re-emergence of arthropod-borne viruses are major concerns for both human and animal health. The most recent example is the fast expansion of EHDV-8 through Europe. Besides, EHDV-8 relates with a high prevalence of pathologic cases in cattle populations. No vaccine is currently available in Europe, and vaccine research against this arboviral disease is negligible. In this work, we present novel DIVA vaccine candidates against EHDV, and most importantly, we identified the protein VP7 of EHDV as an antigen capable of inducing multiserotype protection, one of the major challenges in vaccine research against orbiviruses.",

The 2021 Family and Youth Protection Law further restricted access to reproductive health services in an effort to boost birth rates. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the reasons women sought abortions in an illegal context, based on their own experiences. This exploratory qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 46 women in Kermanshah, Iran, between April and August 2024. All participants had experienced incomplete abortions after undergoing unsafe procedures. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and thematic analysis with MAXQDA 10 software to identify key themes in the women's experiences. To ensure the study's rigor, we applied Guba and Lincoln\u2019s criteria, including credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability. Five main themes emerged from the interviews: economic hardship, pursuit of a prosperous life, unstable marital relationships, health and fertility issues, and cultural factors. Economic challenges, such as unemployment and lack of basic necessities, were the most frequently cited reasons for seeking unsafe abortions. Health issues, including unplanned pregnancies and fear of fetal anomalies, also played a significant role, alongside cultural stigmas related to age, illegitimacy, and gender preferences. This study sheds light on the multifaceted factors driving unsafe abortions in Iran following pronatalist policy changes. A holistic approach is recommended to address the interconnected economic, social, and cultural challenges that contribute to this issue. By implementing such comprehensive strategies, policymakers and stakeholders can work to reduce the prevalence of unsafe abortion practices and foster improved health and well-being for women.",

This broader definition provides a more comprehensive measure of excess mortality compared to the officially confirmed COVID-19 deaths attributed to the virus. We identified 35,399 COVID-19 associated deaths during the 3-year pandemic in Slovakia compared to 21,395 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. The identification of COVID-19 associated deaths with our methodology offers a more accurate explanation for the notably high excess mortality observed in Slovakia (31,789 deaths) during the pandemic, relative to the EU27. Given the high level of excess mortality, the officially confirmed deaths are likely underestimated, and the presented methodology provides a more precise measure of mortality. Additionally, healthcare billing records prove valuable in identifying these deaths at the individual patient level using claims data of health insurance companies, which is crucial for implementing targeted preventive measures and improving preparedness for future pandemics.",

Despite global efforts to reduce their prevalence, follow\u2010up studies are needed to see if the measures are successful. Since most infants in Norway are breastfed for the first 6 months of life, monitoring POP contamination in breastmilk is important for children's health and development. This study aims to evaluate the current levels of various POPs in women's breastmilk in Innlandet County, Norway. A cross\u2010sectional study was conducted measuring concentrations of 35 different POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlordanes (ChlDs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), Mirex, and brominated flame retardants in 120 breastmilk samples. The study analysed the impact of maternal age, parity, pre\u2010pregnancy BMI, and infant age on POPs levels and compared the estimated daily intake per body weight of infants to existing health guidelines. The detected percentages for PCBs were 100%, for DDTs 98.3%, and for ChlDs 98.3%. The highest median concentration was found for \u03a3PCBs (26.9\u2009ng/g lw). Maternal age, parity, and infant age were significant determinants of POP concentrations. Most infants exceeded the health\u2010based guidance values for \u03a3PCB, and 6.4% percent did so for \u03a3HCHs. Despite lower POPs concentrations in breastmilk than in earlier studies, many breastfed infants are still exposed to levels exceeding health\u2010based guidance values. Although the study's design had limitations, the study provides updated population\u2010based data on POPs in breastmilk. Continued monitoring and research are necessary to understand and mitigate potential health risks associated with POPs.",

They completed self\u2010reported questionnaires to assess subjective sleep and emotional distress. A sleep diary was used to evaluate subjective sleep parameters. All participants performed the emotional Stroop task (three blocks each of negative emotional, sleep\u2010related, and neutral words) during functional magnetic resonance imaging assessments. We compared brain activation during the emotional Stroop task between the two groups. We also analysed the correlations between altered neural activation and sleep variables. Less neural activation was detected in the right anterior prefrontal cortex of patients with chronic insomnia disorder than in controls when performing the emotional Stroop task with negative emotional words. The decrease in neural activation was negatively correlated with scores on Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, and Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale. In contrast, they were positively correlated with subjective total sleep time and sleep efficiency as reported in sleep diaries. A decrease in right anterior prefrontal cortex activity under the negative emotional words condition of the emotional Stroop task in patients with chronic insomnia disorder suggests a failure of top\u2010down inhibition of negative emotional stimuli.

M-DIP employs a spatial dictionary to synthesize a time-dependent template image, which is further refined using time-dependent deformation fields that model cardiac and respiratory motion. Unlike prior DIP-based methods, M-DIP simultaneously captures physiological motion and frame-to-frame content variations, making it applicable to a wide range of dynamic applications.

We predicted these cumulative costs for a typical patient to improve cost transparency, facilitate conversations about potential costs, and to help advance non-metastatic prostate cancer cost evaluation. We used Merative\u2122 MarketScan\u00ae Commercial Database data from 2007\u20132020. The cumulative total costs evaluated from the healthcare sector perspective were patient, clinician, and system/facility costs. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the sociodemographic characteristics of the cohort and a multivariable regression model to estimate the association between each treatment option (radiation, surgery, conservative management) and costs with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to account for potential selection bias. We then predicted total and OOP costs defined by sample mode characteristics. This cohort included 74,324 patients. Cumulative total and OOP costs were significantly higher for radiation (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and for surgery (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) at Years 1, 3, and 5 compared to conservative management. For a typical patient, total cumulative cost estimates for conservative management at Years 1/3/5 were: $15,896/$33,436/$48,110 and the cumulative patient OOP costs were: $2,003/$4,540/$6,621. The cumulative total costs for surgery at Years 1/3/5 were: $38,348/$49,424/$60,885 and the cumulative OOP costs were: $2,980/$5,255/$7,221.

For all years, the cumulative costs of radiation were highest, followed by surgery and conservative management, respectively. Radiation as the first treatment modality had higher costs compared to surgery and conservative management at the 3 time points.

The Cytiva Nucleon PhytoPure and the Macherey-Nagel NucleoBond HMW DNA kits were selected because the former requires lower amounts of starting material and the latter utilizes gentler methods to maximize DNA length, albeit at a higher requirement for input material. The Cytiva Nucleon PhytoPure kit successfully recovered HMW DNA for half of our fungal species by increasing the amount of RNase A treatment and adding in a proteinase K treatment. To reduce the impact of pigmentation development, which occurs toward later stages of culturing, extractions were run in quadruplicate to increase overall DNA concentration. We also adapted the Macherey-Nagel NucleoBond HMW DNA kit for high-quality HMW DNA by grinding the sample to a fine powder, overnight lysis, and splitting the sample before washing the precipitated DNA. For both kits, precipitated DNA was spooled out pre-washing, ensuring a higher percentage of high-integrity long strands.

This report aims to emphasize the importance of considering AMNs in the differential diagnosis of atypical pelvic symptoms, especially when initial evaluations suggest gynecological issues. A 56-year-old female with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia and a total vaginal hysterectomy performed over 20 years prior for abnormal uterine bleeding due to fibroids presented to her gynecologist with a three-week history of vaginal discharge and pelvic pain. Initial gynecological assessments were unremarkable, prompting a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which revealed a markedly dilated, fluid-filled appendix, indicative of a mucinous neoplasm. The patient underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, which confirmed a low-grade AMN with clear margins. Post-surgical follow-up showed no recurrence, and a surveillance colonoscopy one year later revealed a benign tubular adenoma. This case highlights the need to consider AMNs in the differential diagnosis of pelvic symptoms, particularly when initial gynecological evaluations do not identify a clear cause. AMNs can present with symptoms that overlap with those of gynecological conditions, making accurate diagnosis challenging. Effective management through early recognition and surgical intervention is important to prevent complications. This report demonstrates the value of comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and the importance of including rare tumors in the differential diagnosis of atypical pelvic symptoms.",

Recent studies have shown that shifts in the diapause stage precede social evolution in wasps and bees; however, the genomic basis remains unknown. Given the overlap in molecular pathways that regulate diapause and lifespan, we hypothesized that the evolutionary loss of developmental diapause may lead to extended lifespan among adults, which is a prerequisite for the evolution of eusociality. To test whether the loss of prepupal diapause is followed by genomic changes associated with lifespan extension, we compared 27 bee genomes with or without prepupal diapause. Our results point to several potential mechanisms for lifespan extension in species lacking prepupal diapause, including the loss of the growth hormone PTTH and its receptor TORSO, along with convergent selection in genes known to regulate lifespan in animals. Specifically, we observed purifying selection of prolongevity genes and relaxed selection of antilongevity genes within the IIS/TOR pathway in species that have lost prepupal diapause. Changes in selection pressures on this pathway may lead to the evolution of new phenotypes, such as lifespan extension and altered responses to nutritional signals that are crucial for social evolution.",

These lesions are poorly recognized, difficult to diagnose, and require specific arthroscopic exploration. Ramp lesions are typically associated with anterior cruciate ligament rupture and have important biomechanical consequences as they result in increased anterior tibial translation and external rotation. Suture hook repair through the posteromedial portal is safe and provides a high healing rate. Spontaneous healing of ramp lesions is rarely observed, and repair is indicated for all lesions with the involvement of meniscotibial ligament. The choice of a posteromedial repair technique with vertical suture performed under visual control allows restoration of the continuity of meniscotibial ligament and effective healing of these lesions. Standardized arthroscopic exploration with systematic visualization of the posteromedial compartment using the transnotch technique is a crucial point to diagnose these lesions. The use of transillumination and a needle allows to palpate the lesion with the tip of the needle in case of doubt (hidden lesion) before performing the posteromedial portal safely. By using the transnotch vision and by introducing the instruments through the posteromedial portal, debridement with the shaver and repair with the hook of the lesion are performed under visual control. Vertical repair is performed by taking care to pass the hook through the meniscotibial ligament by perforating the deep face of the capsular portion and anterior portion of the ramp lesion. Similarly, it is recommended not to catch too much meniscal tissue on the anterior margin side to remain in the red zone and not to perforate the meniscus in the avascular zone to avoid secondary lesions caused by the \u201ccheese wire\u201d effect of the sutures in the white zone. This technique has allowed us to reduce our percentage of secondary meniscectomy after ramp lesion repair from 25% using a standard arthroscopic exploration and meniscal repair technique through the anterior portal to 11.3% using a arthroscopic exploration and repair technique through the posteromedial portal at 4 years of follow-up. Systematic use of the transnotch vision and repair through the posteromedial portal are recommended for the management of these lesions, which demonstrate serious mechanical and clinical consequences.",

Some common issues when addressing these injuries surgically include the \u201cbungee-cord\u201d effect seen with implants that sit too far from the tibial plateau surface and loss of tension on the sutures after cycling of the knee after the repair. This video will discuss the presentation of a patient with a medial meniscal root repair treated with a novel technique to counteract these aforementioned issues. Based on the patient\u2019s medial meniscal root tear and minimal arthritis seen on radiograph, he was indicated for a meniscal root repair to prevent meniscal extrusion and reinforce normal meniscal hoop stresses to limit progression of his arthritis. This technique uses a novel re-tensionable all-suture anchor through a transtibial tunnel with 2 repair sutures through the meniscal root that sits just below the tibial plateau, allowing the surgeon the ability to re-tension the implant after cycling the knee. Arthroscopic repair of the medial meniscal root allowed the patient to return to his previous level of activity. In this case, arthroscopic medial meniscal root repair can yield good results in patients to get them back to their previous level of activity while minimizing the chance of rapid arthritic progression that is typically seen with nonoperative management of these injuries.

Risk factors include trochlear dysplasia, patella alta, abnormal patellar tilt, and increased tibial tubercle to trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance. A variety of surgical options are available for addressing patellar instability, and the selection of each technique should be tailored to the unique pathoanatomy of each patient. Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLR) is indicated for patients with patellar instability, and tibial tubercle osteotomy (TTO) is indicated for patients with a TT-TG >20 mm. An anterior midline incision is performed to expose the patella, patellar tendon, and tibial tubercle. Diagnostic arthroscopy is performed to assess patellar engagement and cartilage integrity, followed by the TTO. Three guidewires are placed with 15\u00b0 of obliquity, to guide a 6-cm osteotomy, from medial to lateral and from proximal to distal. A distal cortical hinge must be left intact. A 15-mm medial resection of the tibial tubercle is performed to avoid protrusion against the skin, which is followed by medialization of the tubercle and fixation with K-wires until dynamic testing ensures proper alignment and definitive fixation is achieved with cannulated headless screws. A lateral retinacular lengthening is performed to balance patellar forces. MPFLR is executed using a semitendinosus allograft. The graft is anchored to the patella and drawn through a surgically created plane to the medial femoral condyle. The femoral tunnel is created under fluoroscopy guidance, and the graft is then passed and secured. Graft tension and patellar mobility are adjusted according to dynamic testing. Once patellar stability is achieved and maintained through range of motion, the graft is then fixed. Patients can expect improved clinical outcomes with a high return-to-sports rate following both isolated MPFLR and concomitant TTO. The combination of MPFLR + TTO significantly reduces revision rate, compared to isolated MPFLR in patients with increased TT-TG distance, and enhances postoperative patellofemoral tracking. MPFLR + TTO improves patellofemoral tracking and corrects patellar instability, substantially improving postoperative outcomes compared to MPFLR alone. Patients with patellar instability and an increased TT-TG may be effectively treated with MPFLR + TTO.

The most common secondary indications included combined osseous and ligamentous deficiency, associated vascular or soft\u2010tissue injury, status post extensive capsular release for arthrofibrosis, and associated extensor mechanism disruption.

To understand these potential detriments resulting from EHR communication, we analyzed EHR messages sent between patients and health workers at Emory Healthcare, a large academic healthcare system in Atlanta, Georgia. We quantified the burden of messages interacted with by each health worker type and visualized the communication patterns using graph theory. Our analysis included 76,694 conversations comprising 144,369 messages sent between 47,460 patients and 3,749 health workers across 85 healthcare specialties. On average, nurses/certified nursing assistants/medical assistants (nurses/CNA/MA) interacted with the most messages (350), followed by non-physician practitioners (NPP) (241), physicians (166), and support staff (155), with the average conversation involving 10.51 interactions before resolution. Network analysis of the communication flow revealed that each health worker was connected to approximately two other health workers (average degree = 2.10). In message sending, support staff led in closeness centrality (0.44), followed by nurses/CNA/MA (0.41), highlighting their key role in fast information spread. For message reception, nurses/CNA/MA (0.51) and support staff (0.41) also had the highest values, underscoring their vital role in the communication network on the receiving end as well.

While most of these studies used task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there is an increasing interest in resting-state fMRI to characterize aberrant network dynamics involved in this and other MDD-associated symptoms. It has been proposed that activity during the resting-state represents characteristics of brain-wide functional organization, which could be highly relevant for the efficient execution of cognitive tasks. However, the dynamics linking resting-state properties and task-evoked activity remain poorly understood. Therefore, the present study investigated the association between spontaneous activity as indicated by the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) at rest and activity during an emotional n-back task. 60 patients diagnosed with an acute MDD episode, and 52 healthy controls underwent the fMRI scanning procedure. Within both groups, positive correlations between spontaneous activity at rest and task-activation were found in core regions of the central-executive network (CEN), whereas spontaneous activity correlated negatively with task-deactivation in regions of the default mode network (DMN). Compared to healthy controls, patients showed a decreased rest-task correlation in the left prefrontal cortex (CEN) and an increased negative correlation in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (DMN). Interestingly, no significant group-differences within those regions were found solely at rest or during the task. The results underpin the potential value and importance of resting-state markers for the understanding of dysfunctional network dynamics and neural substrates of cognitive processing.",

              "content": "An integrated care pathway to manage small and nutritionally at\u2010risk infants under 6 months (u6m) and their mothers (MAMI Care Pathway) is consistent with 2023 WHO malnutrition guidelines and is being tested in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in Ethiopia. To optimise trial implementation, we investigated contextual fit with key local stakeholders. We used scenario\u2010based interviews with 17 health workers and four district managers to explore perceived feasibility. Eighteen policymakers were also surveyed to explore policy coherence, demand, acceptability, evidence needs, opportunities and risks. The Bowen feasibility framework and an access to health care framework were adapted and applied. Health workers perceived the MAMI Care Pathway as feasible to implement with support to access services and provide care. The approach is acceptable, given consistency with national policies, local protocols and potential to improve routine care quality. Demand for more comprehensive, preventive and person\u2010centred outpatient care was driven by concerns about unmet, hidden and costly care burden for health services and families. Inpatient care only for severe wasting treatment is inaccessible and unacceptable. Support for routine and expanded components, especially maternal mental health, is needed for successful implementation. Wider contextual factors may affect implementation fidelity and strength. Policymakers cautiously welcomed the approach, which resonates with national commitments, policies and plans but need evidence on how it can work within varied, complex contexts without further system overstretch. A responsive, pragmatic randomised controlled trial will generate the most useful evidence for policymakers. Findings have informed trial preparation and implementation, including a realist evaluation to contextualise outcomes.",

Carbon dots (CDs) are a novel category of carbon nanomaterials that exhibit outstanding optical properties, excellent biocompatibility, high water solubility, low production costs, and straightforward synthesis. Recently, researchers have developed various carbon dot sensors for fast and real-time Glu monitoring. In this context, we provide a comprehensive introduction to Glu and CDs for the first time. We categorize the synthetic methods for CDs and the sensing mechanisms, further classifying the applications of carbon dot probes into single-probe sensing, ratiometric sensing, and visual detection.

The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

The induction of MOID depends on PML and DAXX mediating mitochondrial AIFM1-release.

              "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents a significant medical challenge due to its highly invasive nature, high rate of metastasis, and lack of drug-targetable receptors, which together lead to poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The traditional treatment guidelines for early TNBC are based on a multimodal approach integrating chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation and are associated with low overall survival and high relapse rates. Therefore, the approach to treating early TNBC has shifted towards neoadjuvant treatment (NAC), given to the patient before surgery and which aims to reduce tumour size, reduce the risk of recurrence, and improve the pathological complete response (pCR) rate. However, recent studies have shown that NAC is associated with only 30% of patients achieving pCR. Thus, novel predictive biomarkers are essential if treatment decisions are to be optimised and chemotherapy toxicities minimised. Given the heterogeneity of TNBC, mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies offer valuable tools for the discovery of targetable biomarkers for prognosis and prediction of toxicity. These biomarkers can serve as critical targets for therapeutic intervention. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of TNBC diagnosis and treatment, highlighting the need for a new approach. Specifically, it highlights how mass spectrometry-based can address key unmet clinical needs by identifying novel protein biomarkers to distinguish and early prognostication between TNBC patient groups who are being treated with NAC. By integrating proteomic insights, we anticipate enhanced treatment personalisation, improved clinical outcomes, and ultimately, increased survival rates for TNBC patients.",

For clinical evaluation, halitosis and HCB were evaluated pre-gargle (baseline), immediately after gargling (treatment), and 5 days after gargling (5 days post-treatment). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows. The level of subjective improvement was statistically significantly greater in the LCE group than the saline group (p < 0.05). Compared with the saline group, the LCE group showed reduced halitosis after 5 days of application. Furthermore, halitosis statistically significantly decreased over time (p < 0.05). Moreover, the LCE group showed a statistically significant decrease in the number of all six HCBs (p < 0.05). LCE gargle was effective in reducing halitosis both subjectively and objectively, suggesting an antibacterial effect on HCBs in the oral cavity. Thus, LCE, which can be used as a safe mouthwash ingredient, can promote oral health and will be valuable for the oral healthcare product industry.

Recently, researchers have developed various carbon dot sensors for fast and real-time Glu monitoring. In this context, we provide a comprehensive introduction to Glu and CDs for the first time. We categorize the synthetic methods for CDs and the sensing mechanisms, further classifying the applications of carbon dot probes into single-probe sensing, ratiometric sensing, and visual detection. Finally, we discuss the future development needs for CD-based Glu sensors. This review aims to offer insights into advancing Glu sensors and modern medical treatments.",

It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.",

The median age of the participants was 69 years. Of the 3091 participants, 1411 (45.6%) were men, and 56 (1.8%) had an AF history. AF prevalence was significantly higher in participants with higher antibody levels against PG than in those with lower antibody levels (3.0% vs 1.4%; p = 0.005). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that participants with higher antibody levels against PG had twofold higher odds of having AF (odds ratio = 2.13; 95% confidence interval = 1.23\u20133.69).

Fifteen patients diagnosed with stage III/grade C periodontitis were included in the cohort. The right and left sides of the mouth were randomly assigned either the conventional SRP (control) group or the SRP supplemented with Nd:YAG laser group (experimental group, 160 mJ, 4 W) in a split-mouth design. Clinical periodontal indices were recorded at baseline and at the 6-week follow-up post-treatment. ELISA was utilised to measure IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in gingival crevicular fluid. The subgingival microbiota\u2019s composition and variations were characterised using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, while quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to analyse the changes in the red-complex bacteria in subgingival plaque. The SRP+Nd group exhibited a statistically significant reduction in record probing depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP) compared to the SRP group after treatment (p<0.05). The SRP+Nd group showed a markedly lower IL-1\u03b2 level than the SRP group (p<0.05). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in the dominant subgingival microbiota composition and level of the red-complex bacteria between the two groups (p>0.05). The adjunctive use of Nd:YAG laser with SRP demonstrates promising short-term therapeutic benefits for patients with extensive stage III/grade C periodontitis. Both SRP as a standalone treatment and its combination with Nd:YAG laser effectively facilitate a transition in the dominant bacterial community from periodontitis-associated to periodontal health-associated microbiota.",

Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.",

Changes in cardiovascular/metabolic-related parameters, physical manifestations of hypercortisolism, and quality of life (QoL) were evaluated across the following patient subgroups: both LNSC and mUFC controlled, only mUFC controlled, only LNSC controlled, and neither controlled. Of 160 patients included in the analysis, 85.0% had both LNSC and mUFC uncontrolled at baseline. At week 72, 48.6% of patients had both LNSC and mUFC controlled; these patients generally exhibited greater improvements in cardiovascular/metabolic-related parameters than those with only mUFC controlled or both LNSC and mUFC uncontrolled: systolic/diastolic blood pressure, \u22127.4%/\u22124.9%, \u22126.0%/\u22125.5%, and 2.3%/0.8%, respectively; fasting plasma glucose, \u22125.0%, \u22124.8%, and 1.9%; glycated hemoglobin, \u22125.1%, \u22124.8%, and \u22121.3%.

A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, to get relevant studies previously published before June 2023. No language restrictions were applied. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies have been included to investigate the proportion of patients reporting CA among patients with an established diagnosis of CA, and also the incidence of patients who have CTS among patients with CA has been investigated with a pooled estimation of the expected time from the diagnosis of CTS till the development of CA.\u00a0Studies that did not report data on CTS or CA or lacked sufficient details were excluded. Meta-analysis of data for each outcome was performed using R version R.4.3.2 software (R\u00a0Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) using the Meta package. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the I\u00b2 statistic. A meta-analysis of 15 studies, including 1416 patients, evaluated the relationship between CTS\u00a0and CA. Among these, 495 patients with CTS were assessed for the presence of CA, and 915 patients with CA were evaluated for the presence of CTS. The pooled meta-analysis of eight studies, which included 915 patients with CA, revealed that 38% (95% CI: 35%-41%) had a history of CTS. Conversely, the proportion of patients with CTS who developed CA was 13% (95% CI: 4%-35%). The pooled mean time from CTS to the development of CA, based on 639 patients across four studies, was 6.02 years (95% CI: 3.76-8.36).\u00a0Significant heterogeneity was noted for some outcomes (e.g., proportion of CA in patients with CTS: I\u00b2=93%), likely influenced by variations in study populations, age distributions, and diagnostic criteria. Our review of the literature suggests that there may be a link between CTS and CA. However, more research is needed to confirm this link and to understand how the two conditions are related. It is important to consider the possibility of CA in patients with CTS, as screening, early detection, and timely treatment can improve outcomes by slowing disease progression and reducing complications.",

A comprehensive search of electronic databases, including EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and PubMed, used Medical Subject Headings terms and Boolean operators to identify relevant studies. Comparative trials assessing postoperative outcomes and costs between RC and LC were included. Data were extracted independently by researchers and analyzed using the RevMan 5.4 software (The Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK). The analysis included six studies with a total of 1,013 patients, comprising three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and three cohorts conducted across Switzerland, Taiwan, the USA, and Italy. Results showed that LC had a significantly shorter operation duration than RC (standardized mean difference: 0.27; 95% CI, 0.05-0.49; p = 0.01). No significant differences were observed between RC and LC in terms of bile leak rates (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.06-2.21; p = 0.27) or postoperative complications (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.18-1.37; p = 0.18). Cost analysis revealed that RC was more cost-effective than LC (standardized mean difference, 3.16; 95% CI, 0.39-5.93; p = 0.03), with substantial heterogeneity noted among the studies. The findings suggest that RC does not provide significant clinical advantages over LC in postoperative outcomes and incurs higher costs. Due to the heterogeneity and the limited number of RCTs included, a major multicenter RCT\u00a0is recommended to validate these results further. In conclusion, LC remains the preferred approach due to its shorter operative time and cost-effectiveness, with no significant differences in clinical outcomes compared to da Vinci RC.

CTS can be a sign of early CA, and CA can be a hidden cause of heart failure. Therefore, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to investigate the expected correlation between the occurrence of CTS and CA. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, to get relevant studies previously published before June 2023. No language restrictions were applied. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies have been included to investigate the proportion of patients reporting CA among patients with an established diagnosis of CA, and also the incidence of patients who have CTS among patients with CA has been investigated with a pooled estimation of the expected time from the diagnosis of CTS till the development of CA.\u00a0Studies that did not report data on CTS or CA or lacked sufficient details were excluded. Meta-analysis of data for each outcome was performed using R version R.4.3.2 software (R\u00a0Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) using the Meta package. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the I\u00b2 statistic. A meta-analysis of 15 studies, including 1416 patients, evaluated the relationship between CTS\u00a0and CA. Among these, 495 patients with CTS were assessed for the presence of CA, and 915 patients with CA were evaluated for the presence of CTS. The pooled meta-analysis of eight studies, which included 915 patients with CA, revealed that 38% (95% CI: 35%-41%) had a history of CTS. Conversely, the proportion of patients with CTS who developed CA was 13% (95% CI: 4%-35%). The pooled mean time from CTS to the development of CA, based on 639 patients across four studies, was 6.02 years (95% CI: 3.76-8.36).\u00a0Significant heterogeneity was noted for some outcomes (e.g., proportion of CA in patients with CTS: I\u00b2=93%), likely influenced by variations in study populations, age distributions, and diagnostic criteria. Our review of the literature suggests that there may be a link between CTS and CA. However, more research is needed to confirm this link and to understand how the two conditions are related. It is important to consider the possibility of CA in patients with CTS, as screening, early detection, and timely treatment can improve outcomes by slowing disease progression and reducing complications.",

We produced monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against  S. mansoni The LFTS demonstrated a limit of detection (LoD) of 3 ng/ml. The sensitivity and specificity of the developed LFTS were found to be 96.7% and 95%, respectively, compared to 85% and 90% for the POC-CCA detection kit. The cases were divided into groups based on egg count in the stool, categorized as light, moderate, and heavy infections. The sensitivity of the LFTS in the group with light infection was higher than that of the POC-CCA. When using the KK technique (eggs per gram of stool sample [EPG]) as the reference test, the kappa value for the nano-based strips was 0.902, compared to 0.672 for the CCA strips, indicating an almost perfect agreement between KK and our developed LFTS. These results confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the LFTS compared to commercially available kits for rapid, sensitive, and early diagnosis of schistosomiasis. However, it is recommended to conduct further assessments of the developed strip on a larger scale with a broader range of cases before considering its introduction to local or international markets.",
            "Robotic cholecystectomy (RC) using the da Vinci surgical system has been introduced as a potential alternative to the gold standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for gallbladder removal. This systematic review aims to evaluate and compare the postoperative outcomes (operative time, bile leak, and postoperative complications) and cost-effectiveness between da Vinci RC and LC. A comprehensive search of electronic databases, including EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and PubMed, used Medical Subject Headings terms and Boolean operators to identify relevant studies. Comparative trials assessing postoperative outcomes and costs between RC and LC were included. Data were extracted independently by researchers and analyzed using the RevMan 5.4 software (The Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK). The analysis included six studies with a total of 1,013 patients, comprising three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and three cohorts conducted across Switzerland, Taiwan, the USA, and Italy. Results showed that LC had a significantly shorter operation duration than RC (standardized mean difference: 0.27; 95% CI, 0.05-0.49; p = 0.01). No significant differences were observed between RC and LC in terms of bile leak rates (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.06-2.21; p = 0.27) or postoperative complications (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.18-1.37; p = 0.18). Cost analysis revealed that RC was more cost-effective than LC (standardized mean difference, 3.16; 95% CI, 0.39-5.93; p = 0.03), with substantial heterogeneity noted among the studies. The findings suggest that RC does not provide significant clinical advantages over LC in postoperative outcomes and incurs higher costs. Due to the heterogeneity and the limited number of RCTs included, a major multicenter RCT\u00a0is recommended to validate these results further. In conclusion, LC remains the preferred approach due to its shorter operative time and cost-effectiveness, with no significant differences in clinical outcomes compared to da Vinci RC. Further research with larger, multicenter trials is warranted to confirm these findings and guide clinical decision-making.",
            "This case report aims to enhance understanding of pancreatobiliary maljunction (PBM) and promote more proactive treatment. The patient, a 24-year-old Chinese female, was admitted to the hospital on April 7, 2020, due to \u201crecurrent abdominal pain for over 2 years, with a recent episode accompanied by nausea and vomiting for 1 day.\u201d She had a previous history of gallstones. The initial diagnosis upon admission was biliary acute pancreatitis. During the emergency endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, anatomical abnormalities were discovered. Intraoperative endoscopic ultrasonography led to a diagnosis of complex PBM (JSPBM, type D)\u2005+\u2005choledochal cyst (Todani, Ic)\u2005+\u2005incomplete pancreatic divisum\u2005+\u2005early chronic pancreatitis. These diagnoses were confirmed by postoperative magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. After multiple conservative treatments such as ERCP with accessory pancreatic duct stent placement, the patient underwent surgical treatment in April 2021, which included \u201claparoscopic left hemihepatectomy\u2005+\u2005choledochal cyst excision\u2005+\u2005cholecystectomy\u2005+\u2005hepatic portal cholangioplasty.\u201d The patient has not experienced any abdominal pain since the surgery and is currently under regular follow-up. Endoscopic ultrasound is effective for the diagnoses of complex PBM and incomplete pancreatic divisum. ERCP with pancreatic duct stent placement and surgical procedure is reliable for relieving the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The management of acute mercury vapor poisoning remains unclear, particularly in acute lung injury. We present a case of mercury vapor poisoning resulting from the heating of cinnabar, successfully treated with high-dose corticosteroids and chelation therapy, and follow-up over 6 months. A 47-year-old female patient was admitted to the Emergency Department due to dyspnea, chest tightness, and weakness following cinnabar heating. Upon admission, she presented with tachypnea and respiratory failure. During the first 5 days, the respiratory failure rapidly progressed, requiring high-flow nasal cannula support, and showed no improvement with broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics and 80\u2005mg daily IV methylprednisolone. Total blood and urinary mercury levels were measured to confirm the diagnosis. Upon confirmation of acute pneumonitis due to mercury vapor poisoning, the patient was administered high-dose methylprednisolone (500\u2005mg IV per day) and chelation therapy, which led to subsequent improvement. Six months after discharge, the patient completely recovered, as evidenced by chest imaging and pulmonary function tests. Heating elemental mercury can cause pneumonitis, leading to acute respiratory failure. A detailed history is crucial for diagnosis.

The traditional treatment guidelines for early TNBC are based on a multimodal approach integrating chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation and are associated with low overall survival and high relapse rates. Therefore, the approach to treating early TNBC has shifted towards neoadjuvant treatment (NAC), given to the patient before surgery and which aims to reduce tumour size, reduce the risk of recurrence, and improve the pathological complete response (pCR) rate. However, recent studies have shown that NAC is associated with only 30% of patients achieving pCR. Thus, novel predictive biomarkers are essential if treatment decisions are to be optimised and chemotherapy toxicities minimised. Given the heterogeneity of TNBC, mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies offer valuable tools for the discovery of targetable biomarkers for prognosis and prediction of toxicity. These biomarkers can serve as critical targets for therapeutic intervention. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of TNBC diagnosis and treatment, highlighting the need for a new approach. Specifically, it highlights how mass spectrometry-based can address key unmet clinical needs by identifying novel protein biomarkers to distinguish and early prognostication between TNBC patient groups who are being treated with NAC. By integrating proteomic insights, we anticipate enhanced treatment personalisation, improved clinical outcomes, and ultimately, increased survival rates for TNBC patients.",

Most were male (87.7%), aged 35\u2005years or less (55.4%), working in tertiary care hospitals (68.4%) and undertaking 51\u2013100 child consultations every day (45%). Only 15% reported obtaining training on antibiotic usage, AMR and/or antimicrobial stewardship. Only 7.6% confirmed functional antimicrobial stewardship programmes in their institutions. Most had adequate knowledge of antibiotic use and AMR. However, key issues were not fully understood with only 27.4% believing antibiotics were being overused among children. Paediatricians with less experience, and who undertook fewer consultations per day, had significantly lower knowledge scores. Most participants were prepared to initiate antimicrobial stewardship programmes; however, perceived barriers included a lack of online learning sources, treatment guidelines and support from hospital administration. Paediatricians had appropriate knowledge about antibiotic use and AMR although concerns with antibiotic use. Important barriers to integrating antimicrobial stewardship programmes were identified, which need addressing for these to become routine.",

            "Among 3 forms of mercury, elemental mercury vapor presents the highest threat due to its potential to cause acute pneumonitis. The management of acute mercury vapor poisoning remains unclear, particularly in acute lung injury. We present a case of mercury vapor poisoning resulting from the heating of cinnabar, successfully treated with high-dose corticosteroids and chelation therapy, and follow-up over 6 months. A 47-year-old female patient was admitted to the Emergency Department due to dyspnea, chest tightness, and weakness following cinnabar heating. Upon admission, she presented with tachypnea and respiratory failure. During the first 5 days, the respiratory failure rapidly progressed, requiring high-flow nasal cannula support, and showed no improvement with broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics and 80\u2005mg daily IV methylprednisolone. Total blood and urinary mercury levels were measured to confirm the diagnosis. Upon confirmation of acute pneumonitis due to mercury vapor poisoning, the patient was administered high-dose methylprednisolone (500\u2005mg IV per day) and chelation therapy, which led to subsequent improvement. Six months after discharge, the patient completely recovered, as evidenced by chest imaging and pulmonary function tests. Heating elemental mercury can cause pneumonitis, leading to acute respiratory failure. A detailed history is crucial for diagnosis. High-dose methylprednisolone should be considered in patients who do not respond to lower doses. Patients should be monitored afterward to detect residual pulmonary fibrotic changes.",
            "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents a significant medical challenge due to its highly invasive nature, high rate of metastasis, and lack of drug-targetable receptors, which together lead to poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The traditional treatment guidelines for early TNBC are based on a multimodal approach integrating chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation and are associated with low overall survival and high relapse rates. Therefore, the approach to treating early TNBC has shifted towards neoadjuvant treatment (NAC), given to the patient before surgery and which aims to reduce tumour size, reduce the risk of recurrence, and improve the pathological complete response (pCR) rate. However, recent studies have shown that NAC is associated with only 30% of patients achieving pCR. Thus, novel predictive biomarkers are essential if treatment decisions are to be optimised and chemotherapy toxicities minimised. Given the heterogeneity of TNBC, mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies offer valuable tools for the discovery of targetable biomarkers for prognosis and prediction of toxicity. These biomarkers can serve as critical targets for therapeutic intervention. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of TNBC diagnosis and treatment, highlighting the need for a new approach. Specifically, it highlights how mass spectrometry-based can address key unmet clinical needs by identifying novel protein biomarkers to distinguish and early prognostication between TNBC patient groups who are being treated with NAC. By integrating proteomic insights, we anticipate enhanced treatment personalisation, improved clinical outcomes, and ultimately, increased survival rates for TNBC patients."

            "Neurodegenerative disorders encompass a group of age\u2010related conditions characterized by the gradual decline in both the structure and functionality of the central nervous system (CNS). RNA modifications, arising from the epitranscriptome or RNA\u2010modifying protein mutations, have recently been observed to contribute significantly to neurodegenerative disorders. Specific modifications like N6\u2010methyladenine (m6A), N1\u2010methyladenine (m1A), 5\u2010methylcytosine (m5C), pseudouridine and adenosine\u2010to\u2010inosine (A\u2010to\u2010I) play key roles, with their regulators serving as crucial therapeutic targets. These epitranscriptomic changes intricately control gene expression, influencing cellular functions and contributing to disease pathology. Dysregulation of RNA metabolism, affecting mRNA processing and noncoding RNA biogenesis, is a central factor in these diseases. This review underscores the complex relationship between RNA modifications and neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing the influence of RNA modification and the epitranscriptome, exploring the function of RNA modification enzymes in neurodegenerative processes, investigating the functional consequences of RNA modifications within neurodegenerative pathways, and evaluating the potential therapeutic advancements derived from assessing the epitranscriptome.",

The detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may provide further insight in prognosis as well as help in decision of adjuvant therapies. We aim to show that detection of ctDNA after definitive therapy in oligometastatic CRC is associated with worse outcomes. A single centre prospective study included patients with oligometastatic CRC treated with surgery or radiation with definitive intent. Plasma samples were collected before procedure and 4 weeks after, prior to adjuvant chemotherapy. Plasma samples were analyzed using a tumor-naive assay focusing on genomic and methylation alterations (Guardant Reveal). Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan Meier method. A total of 25 patients were included: 19 were evaluated at baseline and post-treatment. ctDNA detection at baseline was not associated with any clinicopathological characteristics, neither OS nor DFS. In contrast, patients with ctDNA detection post-treatment had worse OS [hazard ratio (HR): 11.28; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31\u201397.05] and a trend to shorter DFS (HR: 2.97; 95% CI: 0.97\u20139.06).

This study assessed the effect of upper eyelid blepharoplasty, subjectively through questionnaires, and objectively through tear film stability and production. This non-randomized, prospective, interventional study consecutively recruited the right eyes of patients with dermatochalasis who underwent bilateral upper eyelid blepharoplasty at a tertiary center. Preoperative assessments included a standardized ophthalmic examination, ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire, Schirmer\u2019s test I, tear break-up time (TBUT) test, and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) to measure tear meniscus height (TMH) and tear meniscus area (TMA). Postoperative evaluations were conducted at 1, 3, and 6 months. At the final follow-up, scar quality and patient satisfaction were assessed using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. Fifty eyes of 50 patients with a mean (standard deviation) age of 47.1 (1.6) years were included.

            "The integrity of the genome is maintained by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins that recognize and repair base mismatches and insertion/deletion errors generated during DNA replication and recombination. A defective MMR system results in genome-wide instability and the progressive accumulation of mutations. Tumors exhibiting deficient MMR (dMMR) and/or high levels of microsatellite instability (termed \u201cmicrosatellite instability high\u201d, or MSI-H) have been shown to possess fundamental differences in clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics, distinguishing them from their \u201cmicrosatellite stable\u201d (MSS) counterparts. Molecularly, they are defined by a high mutational burden, genetic instability, and a distinctive immune profile. Their distinct genetic and immunological profiles have made dMMR/MSI-H tumors particularly amenable to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The ongoing development of biomarker-driven therapies and the evaluation of novel combinations of immune-based therapies, with or without the use of conventional cytotoxic treatment regimens, continue to refine treatment strategies with the goals of maximizing therapeutic efficacy and survival outcomes in this distinct patient population. Moreover, the resultant knowledge of the mechanisms by which these features are suspected to render these tumors more responsive, overall, to immunotherapy may provide information regarding the potential optimization of this therapeutic approach in tumors with proficient MMR (pMMR)/MSS tumors."

The 2021 Family and Youth Protection Law further restricted access to reproductive health services in an effort to boost birth rates. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the reasons women sought abortions in an illegal context, based on their own experiences. This exploratory qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 46 women in Kermanshah, Iran, between April and August 2024. All participants had experienced incomplete abortions after undergoing unsafe procedures. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and thematic analysis with MAXQDA 10 software to identify key themes in the women's experiences. To ensure the study's rigor, we applied Guba and Lincoln\u2019s criteria, including credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability. Five main themes emerged from the interviews: economic hardship, pursuit of a prosperous life, unstable marital relationships, health and fertility issues, and cultural factors. Economic challenges, such as unemployment and lack of basic necessities, were the most frequently cited reasons for seeking unsafe abortions. Health issues, including unplanned pregnancies and fear of fetal anomalies, also played a significant role, alongside cultural stigmas related to age, illegitimacy, and gender preferences. This study sheds light on the multifaceted factors driving unsafe abortions in Iran following pronatalist policy changes. A holistic approach is recommended to address the interconnected economic, social, and cultural challenges that contribute to this issue. By implementing such comprehensive strategies, policymakers and stakeholders can work to reduce the prevalence of unsafe abortion practices and foster improved health and well-being for women.",

A retrospective quantitative analysis was conducted by merging healthcare billing records with cause of death data. The term \u201cCOVID-19 associated death\u201d was defined as any death occurring within a defined timeframe following a confirmed contact with COVID-19. This category includes individuals who died directly due to COVID-19, with COVID-19 as a contributing factor, or as an aftermath of a COVID-19 infection, as well as those who died from other causes but had previously contracted COVID-19. This broader definition provides a more comprehensive measure of excess mortality compared to the officially confirmed COVID-19 deaths attributed to the virus. We identified 35,399 COVID-19 associated deaths during the 3-year pandemic in Slovakia compared to 21,395 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. The identification of COVID-19 associated deaths with our methodology offers a more accurate explanation for the notably high excess mortality observed in Slovakia (31,789 deaths) during the pandemic, relative to the EU27. Given the high level of excess mortality, the officially confirmed deaths are likely underestimated, and the presented methodology provides a more precise measure of mortality. Additionally, healthcare billing records prove valuable in identifying these deaths at the individual patient level using claims data of health insurance companies, which is crucial for implementing targeted preventive measures and improving preparedness for future pandemics.",

Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01).

Constructing a CKD kidney atlas using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can provide deeper insights into the composition and functional changes of immune cells in CKD, facilitating the discovery of new therapeutic targets. We processed and integrated scRNA-seq datasets from healthy and CKD kidneys from three independent cohorts using the same approach (including 42 normal samples and 23 chronic kidney disease samples). Subsequently, we conducted gene enrichment and intercellular communication analysis to construct an immune cell atlas of the kidneys in CKD patients. We identified nine major kidney cell clusters. Further clustering analysis of different immune cell clusters revealed that, compared to normal kidneys, CKD patients\u2019 kidneys had decreased CD16+ NK cells while CD4+ naive helper T cells and CCR7+ DC increased. Partial activation of the WNT signaling pathway was observed in T cells and NK cells of CKD patients, while some metabolism-related genes were inhibited. Myeloid cell subgroups also exhibited abnormal signaling pathway alterations. Additionally, we discovered a unique population of SPP1 macrophages in CKD, which are recruited by chemokines released from aPT and aTAL cell subpopulations. These SPP1 macrophages may promote cellular fibrosis through the signaling of SPP1, FN1, and various receptors. We established a human CKD kidney immune cell atlas and identified SPP1 macrophages as a unique cell type in CKD.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",

            "In Iran, restrictive abortion laws have led to widespread unsafe abortions, posing significant health risks. The 2021 Family and Youth Protection Law further restricted access to reproductive health services in an effort to boost birth rates. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the reasons women sought abortions in an illegal context, based on their own experiences. This exploratory qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 46 women in Kermanshah, Iran, between April and August 2024. All participants had experienced incomplete abortions after undergoing unsafe procedures. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and thematic analysis with MAXQDA 10 software to identify key themes in the women's experiences. To ensure the study's rigor, we applied Guba and Lincoln\u2019s criteria, including credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability. Five main themes emerged from the interviews: economic hardship, pursuit of a prosperous life, unstable marital relationships, health and fertility issues, and cultural factors. Economic challenges, such as unemployment and lack of basic necessities, were the most frequently cited reasons for seeking unsafe abortions. Health issues, including unplanned pregnancies and fear of fetal anomalies, also played a significant role, alongside cultural stigmas related to age, illegitimacy, and gender preferences. This study sheds light on the multifaceted factors driving unsafe abortions in Iran following pronatalist policy changes. A holistic approach is recommended to address the interconnected economic, social, and cultural challenges that contribute to this issue. By implementing such comprehensive strategies, policymakers and stakeholders can work to reduce the prevalence of unsafe abortion practices and foster improved health and well-being for women.",

            "Propose a methodology to identify COVID-19 associated deaths using healthcare billing records and evaluate its effectiveness by comparing the results with excess mortality data from 2020 to 2022 and confirmed COVID-19 deaths. A retrospective quantitative analysis was conducted by merging healthcare billing records with cause of death data. The term \u201cCOVID-19 associated death\u201d was defined as any death occurring within a defined timeframe following a confirmed contact with COVID-19. This category includes individuals who died directly due to COVID-19, with COVID-19 as a contributing factor, or as an aftermath of a COVID-19 infection, as well as those who died from other causes but had previously contracted COVID-19. This broader definition provides a more comprehensive measure of excess mortality compared to the officially confirmed COVID-19 deaths attributed to the virus. We identified 35,399 COVID-19 associated deaths during the 3-year pandemic in Slovakia compared to 21,395 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. The identification of COVID-19 associated deaths with our methodology offers a more accurate explanation for the notably high excess mortality observed in Slovakia (31,789 deaths) during the pandemic, relative to the EU27. Given the high level of excess mortality, the officially confirmed deaths are likely underestimated, and the presented methodology provides a more precise measure of mortality. Additionally, healthcare billing records prove valuable in identifying these deaths at the individual patient level using claims data of health insurance companies, which is crucial for implementing targeted preventive measures and improving preparedness for future pandemics.",

Despite global efforts to reduce their prevalence, follow\u2010up studies are needed to see if the measures are successful. Since most infants in Norway are breastfed for the first 6 months of life, monitoring POP contamination in breastmilk is important for children's health and development. This study aims to evaluate the current levels of various POPs in women's breastmilk in Innlandet County, Norway. A cross\u2010sectional study was conducted measuring concentrations of 35 different POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlordanes (ChlDs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), Mirex, and brominated flame retardants in 120 breastmilk samples. The study analysed the impact of maternal age, parity, pre\u2010pregnancy BMI, and infant age on POPs levels and compared the estimated daily intake per body weight of infants to existing health guidelines. The detected percentages for PCBs were 100%, for DDTs 98.3%, and for ChlDs 98.3%. The highest median concentration was found for \u03a3PCBs (26.9\u2009ng/g lw). Maternal age, parity, and infant age were significant determinants of POP concentrations. Most infants exceeded the health\u2010based guidance values for \u03a3PCB, and 6.4% percent did so for \u03a3HCHs. Despite lower POPs concentrations in breastmilk than in earlier studies, many breastfed infants are still exposed to levels exceeding health\u2010based guidance values. Although the study's design had limitations, the study provides updated population\u2010based data on POPs in breastmilk.

            "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.",
            "The ideal vaccines for combating diseases that may emerge in the future require more than simply inactivating a few pathogenic strains. This study aims to provide a peptide-based multi-epitope vaccine effective against various severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 strains. To design the vaccine, a library of peptides from the spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope structural proteins of various strains was prepared. Then, the final vaccine structure was optimized using the fully protected epitopes and the fynomer scaffold. Using bioinformatics tools, the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, physicochemical properties, population coverage, and secondary and three-dimensional structures of the vaccine candidate were evaluated. The bioinformatic analyses confirmed the high quality of the vaccine. According to further investigations, this structure is similar to native protein and there is a stable and strong interaction between vaccine and receptors. Based on molecular dynamics simulation, structural compactness and stability in binding were also observed. In addition, the immune simulation showed that the vaccine can stimulate immune responses similar to real conditions.

            "Introduction Anemia during pregnancy can lead to poor pregnancy outcomes, increasing maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Timely detection and management can lead to improved pregnancy outcomes. Objective To study various fetomaternal outcomes in severe anemia during pregnancy. Methods It is a prospective observational study conducted on 102 pregnant females, who presented with severe anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) < 7 gm/dL) between February 2020 and March 2021. Results In this study, 50% of patients presented before term (<37 weeks of gestation). Patients predominantly belonged to the rural population (n = 71, or 69.61%), the majority were multigravidas (81.37%), and 56.86% belonged to the upper-lower socioeconomic class. The mean age at presentation was 26.55 \u00b1 4.99 years. Among maternal outcomes, abruption was seen in 7.84% of patients, post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) in 14.71%, sepsis in 3.92%, prolonged hospitalization in 48.04%, intensive care unit (ICU) admission in 4.90%, and maternal mortality in one patient. Additionally, 82.35% of patients went into spontaneous labor, and 76.47% of patients delivered vaginally. Among fetal and neonatal outcomes, 50% of neonates were premature, 62.75% were low birth weight (LBW), 42.16% were small for gestational age (SGA), and 22.55% of neonates were admitted to the neonatal ICU, of which two neonates expired. Stillbirth was noted in six (5.88%) babies. When the studied population was divided on the basis of the severity of anemia into two groups (Group A: very severe anemia with Hb < 4 gm/dL and Group B: severe anemia with Hb \u2265 4 gm/dL but <7 gm/dL), most of the outcomes were much worse for group A, with a statistically significant difference.\u00a0 Conclusion Not only can very severe anemia (Hb < 4 gm/dL), but also severe anemia (Hb \u2265 4 gm/dL but <7 gm/dL), adversely affect both maternal and fetal outcomes if not diagnosed and optimized on time.",
            "The immune system plays a crucial role in the development of kidney diseases. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can lead to various complications, potentially affecting multiple systems throughout the body. Currently, the description of the immune system in human CKD is not comprehensive enough. Constructing a CKD kidney atlas using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can provide deeper insights into the composition and functional changes of immune cells in CKD, facilitating the discovery of new therapeutic targets. We processed and integrated scRNA-seq datasets from healthy and CKD kidneys from three independent cohorts using the same approach (including 42 normal samples and 23 chronic kidney disease samples). Subsequently, we conducted gene enrichment and intercellular communication analysis to construct an immune cell atlas of the kidneys in CKD patients. We identified nine major kidney cell clusters. Further clustering analysis of different immune cell clusters revealed that, compared to normal kidneys, CKD patients\u2019 kidneys had decreased CD16+ NK cells while CD4+ naive helper T cells and CCR7+ DC increased. Partial activation of the WNT signaling pathway was observed in T cells and NK cells of CKD patients, while some metabolism-related genes were inhibited. Myeloid cell subgroups also exhibited abnormal signaling pathway alterations. Additionally, we discovered a unique population of SPP1 macrophages in CKD, which are recruited by chemokines released from aPT and aTAL cell subpopulations. These SPP1 macrophages may promote cellular fibrosis through the signaling of SPP1, FN1, and various receptors. We established a human CKD kidney immune cell atlas and identified SPP1 macrophages as a unique cell type in CKD. The interaction between SPP1 macrophages and damaged cells may serve as a potential therapeutic target for treating CKD in the future.",

We further confirmed that changes in gut microbiota succession patterns were significantly related to the metabolic phenotypes of peripartum dairy cows. These findings provide valuable insights for developing health management strategies for peripartum ruminants.",
            "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",

            "In recent years, advancements in immunosuppressive medications and post-transplant management have led to a significant decrease in acute rejection rates in renal allografts and consequent improvement in short-term graft survival. In contrast, recent data have shown an increased incidence of post-transplant glomerular diseases, which currently represent a leading cause of allograft loss. Although pathogenesis is not fully understood, growing evidence supports the role of inherited and immunological factors and has identified potential pre- and post-transplant predictors. In this review, we illustrate recent advancements in the pathogenesis of post-transplant glomerular disease and the role of risk factors and immunological triggers. In addition, we discuss potential prevention and management strategies."

Traditional breath-held imaging protocols, however, pose challenges for patients with arrhythmias or limited breath-holding capacity.

M-DIP employs a spatial dictionary to synthesize a time-dependent template image, which is further refined using time-dependent deformation fields that model cardiac and respiratory motion. Unlike prior DIP-based methods, M-DIP simultaneously captures physiological motion and frame-to-frame content variations, making it applicable to a wide range of dynamic applications. We validate M-DIP using simulated MRXCAT cine phantom data as well as free-breathing real-time cine and single-shot late gadolinium enhancement data from clinical patients. Comparative analyses against state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised approaches demonstrate M-DIP\u2019s performance and versatility. M-DIP achieved better image quality metrics on phantom data, as well as higher reader scores for in-vivo patient data.",

We used Merative\u2122 MarketScan\u00ae Commercial Database data from 2007\u20132020. The cumulative total costs evaluated from the healthcare sector perspective were patient, clinician, and system/facility costs. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the sociodemographic characteristics of the cohort and a multivariable regression model to estimate the association between each treatment option (radiation, surgery, conservative management) and costs with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to account for potential selection bias.

Cumulative total and OOP costs were significantly higher for radiation (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and for surgery (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) at Years 1, 3, and 5 compared to conservative management. For a typical patient, total cumulative cost estimates for conservative management at Years 1/3/5 were: $15,896/$33,436/$48,110 and the cumulative patient OOP costs were: $2,003/$4,540/$6,621.

We examined changes in the geographical range size and abundance of 165 bird species breeding in Japan during the past 40 years, as well as temperature niche changes in the past 20 years. Higher temperatures were recorded within the ranges of non-native species than in those of native species, and we detected range-size expansion and increased abundance among non-native species. Although open-land species exhibited range reductions from the 1970s to the 1990s, many recovered and the ranges of only a few species declined after this period. Nevertheless, the abundance of open-land species did decline, despite range-size recovery; similar inconsistencies were detected for waterbirds and raptors. Analysis of long-term temperatures suggested that species left warmest areas within their distributions while maximum temperatures experienced by species during the survey years did not change systematically. Birds in warm regions may be facing a crisis, with attrition of native bird communities and expansion of non-native species. It is necessary to establish efficient measures to prevent further expansions of non-native species and conservation measures of native species within managed areas in warm regions with few intact habitats.

Indeed, they regulate key processes for the proper functioning of the organism and affect the course of human pathologies. Altered expression of individual miRNAs has been shown in most human cancers, endowed with oncogenic or suppressor potential. Additionally, miRNAs have shown a promising potential as cancer markers. Not only miRNAs are present in various body fluids, such as serum and plasma, they also have high biological stability of miRNAs that in turn facilitates their detection. For these reasons, the use of miRNAs detection as non-invasive prognostic and predictive biomarkers in cancer provides new perspectives and strategies for personalized medicine and cancer therapy. This review summarizes the current knowledge supporting the utility of miRNAs as novel early diagnostic and prognostic tool, with a special focus on the effectiveness of miRNAs of the liquid biopsies in the diagnosis of urogenital cancers. In conclusion, we rightly state that circulating miRNAs and therefore liquid biopsy have the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis, monitoring and even treatment of urological tumors, entering clinical practice as a more accurate, less invasive and more suitable diagnostic tool for patient follow-up compared to current methodologies.

Understanding the optimal frequency for rock breaking under ultrasonic vibration can significantly reduce the cost of rock breaking and extend the service life of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) cutters. This is important for practical engineering applications. This study presents a three-dimensional finite element model of rock breaking by a PDC cutter under ultrasonic vibration. The model was established using ABAQUS software and used to simulate the dynamic rock breaking process of the PDC cutter. A comparative analysis was performed between conventional rock breaking and rock breaking under ultrasonic vibration. According to the result, ultrasonic vibratory rock breaking is more likely to cause damage to the rock when a PDC cutter is used, particularly at a vibration frequency of 40 kHz. As the ultrasonic vibration frequency (20\u201340kHz) increases, the mechanical specific energy (MSE) initially decreases and then increases. The MSE reaches a minimum value at a frequency of 20\u201325 kHz, representing a decrease of 15.52%\u201322.24% compared with conventional rock breaking, which can significantly improve the rock breaking efficiency and reduce the drilling cost. The temperature of the PDC cutter increases significantly under ultrasonic vibration compared with conventional rock breaking. Additionally, the temperature of the PDC cutter increases gradually with an increase in the vibration frequency.

The cumulative total costs for radiation at Years 1/3/5 were: $65,397/$77,859/$91,497 and the cumulative OOP costs were: $3,151/$5,481/$7,504. For all years, the cumulative costs of radiation were highest, followed by surgery and conservative management, respectively. Radiation as the first treatment modality had higher costs compared to surgery and conservative management at the 3 time points. These cost estimates support non-metastatic prostate cancer treatment related cost transparency. These estimates can help researchers evaluate costs and facilitate patient-clinician cost conversations.",
            "The new managerial approach demands the profound examination of capacities, resources, and facilities in social institutions and organizations and optimum and systemic utilization of capacities such as individuals\u2019 abilities, expertise, and skills within the framework of social institutions. This approach will thus empower the community, which is the most appropriate platform for sustainable development, and improve systemic and integrated management. The study is designed systematically to identify the capacities of social institutions to empower the existing capacities and plan management and educational programs in a better manner to use these capacities within communities. This systematic review study is conducted until February 15, 2024. The PRISMA system was used to track the review process and findings. Databases were searched for relevant articles, and the STROBE checklist was used to evaluate the quality of the articles. The community-based social organizations will still face budgetary challenges and costs in their capacity-building efforts. As such, advanced management techniques such as teamwork, collaboration and coordination between departments, innovative thinking, brainstorming, or even the use of program evaluation and analytical actions can help reduce possible challenges. This calls for the availability of exact management models and planners in both government systems and people-centered systems to coordinate such capacities. This will seek to shed more light on the important role of social institutions and hence serve to give a clearer understanding of challenges, opportunities, and supportive actions for such institutions to contribute to better government system management.",
            "Understanding the current status of biodiversity is crucial to preventing its loss in a changing world. We examined changes in the geographical range size and abundance of 165 bird species breeding in Japan during the past 40 years, as well as temperature niche changes in the past 20 years. Higher temperatures were recorded within the ranges of non-native species than in those of native species, and we detected range-size expansion and increased abundance among non-native species. Although open-land species exhibited range reductions from the 1970s to the 1990s, many recovered and the ranges of only a few species declined after this period. Nevertheless, the abundance of open-land species did decline, despite range-size recovery; similar inconsistencies were detected for waterbirds and raptors. Analysis of long-term temperatures suggested that species left warmest areas within their distributions while maximum temperatures experienced by species during the survey years did not change systematically. Birds in warm regions may be facing a crisis, with attrition of native bird communities and expansion of non-native species. It is necessary to establish efficient measures to prevent further expansions of non-native species and conservation measures of native species within managed areas in warm regions with few intact habitats.

Two reviewers independently screened abstracts, reviewed full texts, and extracted data from all studies that presented associations between physical characteristics and apnea\u2010hypopnea index (AHI). A total of 35 studies representing 13,854 patients were included in this review. The mean difference between high AHI and low AHI groups was 4.09\u2009kg/m Several physical exams have strong evidence in the literature supporting their strength at differentiating patients with and without OSA. These should be used routinely among providers who treat OSA, regardless of specialty, to help guide decisions about recommending a sleep study and selecting appropriate treatment. Other physical characteristics may be better assessed through advanced exam techniques or require more research and standardization in the way they are assessed by practitioners.",
            "Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has shown similar or improved clinical outcomes compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at low risk for surgical mortality. This cost-utility analysis compared TAVI with SAPIEN 3 versus SAVR in symptomatic severe aortic stenosis patients at low risk of surgical mortality from the perspective of the Swedish healthcare system. A published, two-stage, Markov-based cost-utility model that captured clinical outcomes from the  Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated according to Recommended Therapies TAVI with SAPIEN 3 resulted in lifetime costs per patient of 940,541 Swedish krona (SEK) and lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient of 7.16, whilst SAVR resulted in lifetime costs and QALYs per patient of 821,380 SEK and 6.81 QALYs, respectively. Compared with SAVR, TAVI offered an incremental improvement of +0.35 QALY per patient at an increased cost of +119,161 SEK per patient over a lifetime horizon, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 343,918 SEK per QALY gained. TAVI with SAPIEN 3 is a cost-effective option versus SAVR for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at low risk for surgical mortality treated in the Swedish healthcare setting. These findings may inform policy decisions in Sweden for the management of this patient group.",
            "Low vision (LV) is a significant public health challenge with profound effects on patients and their families. In Saudi Arabia, studies indicate a high prevalence of LV, yet low vision services (LVS) remain limited, with gaps in optometrist knowledge, training, and service accessibility. This study evaluates the current state of LV services, documents optometrist involvement, and identifies barriers to delivering LVS. A nationwide, cross-sectional study surveyed 275 optometrists using a validated, self-administered electronic questionnaire. Awareness, clinical practices, referral patterns, and perceived barriers were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression analyzed awareness levels and barriers, with statistical significance set at p<0.05. Moderate awareness of the WHO definition of LV was observed (70.1%), significantly higher among those with formal training (90.1%, p<0.001). Only 36.4% provided LV services, primarily in the central region. Low vision cases constituted 1% of patient loads for most participants (44.4%). Key barriers included device unavailability (68.4%), insufficient training (65.8%), and high costs (50.9%). Diabetic retinopathy (70.9%), glaucoma (63.3%), and hereditary conditions (46.5%) were leading causes of LV. Critical gaps in LV care include insufficient awareness, uneven service distribution, and financial/training-related barriers. Enhancing education, improving affordability, and fostering multidisciplinary care are essential. Region-specific interventions are urgently needed to ensure equitable access to LVS across Saudi Arabia.",
            "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding, single-stranded RNAs molecules modulating gene expression thanks to their ability to bind mRNAs. Indeed, they regulate key processes for the proper functioning of the organism and affect the course of human pathologies. Altered expression of individual miRNAs has been shown in most human cancers, endowed with oncogenic or suppressor potential. Additionally, miRNAs have shown a promising potential as cancer markers. Not only miRNAs are present in various body fluids, such as serum and plasma, they also have high biological stability of miRNAs that in turn facilitates their detection. For these reasons, the use of miRNAs detection as non-invasive prognostic and predictive biomarkers in cancer provides new perspectives and strategies for personalized medicine and cancer therapy. This review summarizes the current knowledge supporting the utility of miRNAs as novel early diagnostic and prognostic tool, with a special focus on the effectiveness of miRNAs of the liquid biopsies in the diagnosis of urogenital cancers. In conclusion, we rightly state that circulating miRNAs and therefore liquid biopsy have the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis, monitoring and even treatment of urological tumors, entering clinical practice as a more accurate, less invasive and more suitable diagnostic tool for patient follow-up compared to current methodologies. With the progress of scientific research and the implementation of advanced technologies that also exploit artificial intelligence, the future of oncological diagnosis, especially for urological tumors, could be increasingly oriented towards less invasive approaches and based on precision medicine, tailored for the specific patient.",
            "Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technologies provide unprecedented resolution representing transcriptomics at the level of single cell. One of the biggest challenges in scRNA-seq data analysis is the cell type annotation, which is usually inferred by cell separation approaches. In-silico algorithms that accurately identify individual cell types in ongoing single-cell sequencing studies are crucial for unlocking cellular heterogeneity and understanding the biological basis of diseases. In this study, we focus on robustly identifying cell types in single-cell RNA sequencing data; we conduct a comparative analysis using methods established in biology, like Seurat, Leiden, and WGCNA, as well as Infomap, statistical inference via Stochastic Block Models (SBM), and single-cell Graph Neural Networks (scGNN). We also analyze preprocessing pipelines to identify and optimize key components in the process. Leveraging two independent datasets, PBMC and ROSMAP, we employ clustering algorithms on cell-cell networks derived from gene expression data. Our findings reveal that while clusters detected by WGCNA exhibit limited correspondence with cell types, those identified by multiresolution Infomap and Leiden, and SBM show a closer alignment, with Infomap standing out as a particularly effective approach. Infomap notably offers valuable insights for the precise characterization of cellular landscapes related to neurodegenration and immunology in scRNA-seq.",

This technique was performed using either fluoroscopy or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). The procedure was completed successfully in both cases, with no complications reported. The use of a 0.025\u2005inch GMS-1 guidewire with an electrocautery technique enables effective transseptal puncture without the need for a needle or fluoroscopy. This novel approach offers a safe, efficient, and zero-fluoroscopic alternative for TSP.",
            "Ultrasonic vibration technology has significant potential for breaking hard rocks. Understanding the optimal frequency for rock breaking under ultrasonic vibration can significantly reduce the cost of rock breaking and extend the service life of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) cutters. This is important for practical engineering applications. This study presents a three-dimensional finite element model of rock breaking by a PDC cutter under ultrasonic vibration. The model was established using ABAQUS software and used to simulate the dynamic rock breaking process of the PDC cutter. A comparative analysis was performed between conventional rock breaking and rock breaking under ultrasonic vibration. According to the result, ultrasonic vibratory rock breaking is more likely to cause damage to the rock when a PDC cutter is used, particularly at a vibration frequency of 40 kHz. As the ultrasonic vibration frequency (20\u201340kHz) increases, the mechanical specific energy (MSE) initially decreases and then increases. The MSE reaches a minimum value at a frequency of 20\u201325 kHz, representing a decrease of 15.52%\u201322.24% compared with conventional rock breaking, which can significantly improve the rock breaking efficiency and reduce the drilling cost. The temperature of the PDC cutter increases significantly under ultrasonic vibration compared with conventional rock breaking. Additionally, the temperature of the PDC cutter increases gradually with an increase in the vibration frequency. These results provide theoretical support for the use of ultrasonic vibration technology.",
            "Methods to call, analyze and visualize copy number variations (CNVs) from massive parallel sequencing data have been widely adopted in clinical practice and genetic research. To enable a streamlined analysis of CNV data, comprehensive annotations and good visualizations are indispensable. The ability to detect single exon CNVs is another important feature for genetic testing. Nonetheless, most available open-source tools come with limitations in at least one of these areas. One additional drawback is that available tools deliver data in an unstructured and static format which requires subsequent visualization and formatting efforts. Here we present CNVizard, an interactive Streamlit app allowing a comprehensive visualization of CNVkit data. Furthermore, combining CNVizard with the CNVand pipeline allows the annotation and visualization of CNV or SV VCF files from any CNV caller.

            "Fungal endocarditis (FE) is a rare form of infective endocarditis. Compared to bacterial endocarditis, FE develops more slowly and insidiously, with nonspecific clinical manifestations, making diagnosis more challenging. Cases presenting with low back pain as the initial symptom are exceedingly rare, leading to a high risk of misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. A 61-year-old male was admitted due to recurrent low back pain accompanied by fever for 2 months. He had no history of invasive procedures or immunosuppressive therapy. The patient was diagnosed with FE. The patient underwent surgical treatment, during which the excrescence was removed, and mitral valve replacement was performed. Postoperatively, he received a full course of antifungal therapy. Postoperatively, the patient experienced relief from low back pain and was afebrile. He was discharged after completing antifungal treatment and, upon follow-up after 1 year, had no recurrence of low back pain. In this case, the patient initially presented with low back pain, which, despite the presence of fever and other signs of infection, did not readily suggest a cardiac etiology. This case highlights the importance of not being misled by superficial symptoms and underscores the need for comprehensive and accurate physical examinations and targeted investigations for proper diagnosis.",

The Cytiva Nucleon PhytoPure and the Macherey-Nagel NucleoBond HMW DNA kits were selected because the former requires lower amounts of starting material and the latter utilizes gentler methods to maximize DNA length, albeit at a higher requirement for input material. The Cytiva Nucleon PhytoPure kit successfully recovered HMW DNA for half of our fungal species by increasing the amount of RNase A treatment and adding in a proteinase K treatment. To reduce the impact of pigmentation development, which occurs toward later stages of culturing, extractions were run in quadruplicate to increase overall DNA concentration. We also adapted the Macherey-Nagel NucleoBond HMW DNA kit for high-quality HMW DNA by grinding the sample to a fine powder, overnight lysis, and splitting the sample before washing the precipitated DNA. For both kits, precipitated DNA was spooled out pre-washing, ensuring a higher percentage of high-integrity long strands. The Macherey-Nagel protocol offers advantages over the first through the utilization of gravity columns that provide gentler treatment, yielding >50% of high-purity DNA strands exceeding 40 kbp. The limitation of this method is the requirement for a large quantity of starting material (1 g).

To overcome this obstacle, an in vitro model has been established using homogentisic acid (HGA) to simulate AKU conditions. This model employed immortalized C20/A4 human chondrocytes and serves as a dependable platform for studying AKU pathogenesis.

Furthermore, investigations into inflammatory processes during HGA exposure revealed notable oxidative stress, as indicated by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation. Additionally, the model demonstrated HGA\u2010induced inflammatory responses, evidenced by increased production of nitric oxide, overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase\u20102. These findings underscore the model's utility in studying inflammation associated with AKU. Moreover, analysis of serum amyloid A and serum amyloid P proteins revealed a potential interaction, corroborating evidence of amyloid fibril formation.

Recent studies have shown that shifts in the diapause stage precede social evolution in wasps and bees; however, the genomic basis remains unknown. Given the overlap in molecular pathways that regulate diapause and lifespan, we hypothesized that the evolutionary loss of developmental diapause may lead to extended lifespan among adults, which is a prerequisite for the evolution of eusociality. To test whether the loss of prepupal diapause is followed by genomic changes associated with lifespan extension, we compared 27 bee genomes with or without prepupal diapause. Our results point to several potential mechanisms for lifespan extension in species lacking prepupal diapause, including the loss of the growth hormone PTTH and its receptor TORSO, along with convergent selection in genes known to regulate lifespan in animals. Specifically, we observed purifying selection of prolongevity genes and relaxed selection of antilongevity genes within the IIS/TOR pathway in species that have lost prepupal diapause. Changes in selection pressures on this pathway may lead to the evolution of new phenotypes, such as lifespan extension and altered responses to nutritional signals that are crucial for social evolution.",

            "This manuscript details two modified protocols for the isolation of long-stranded or high molecular weight (HMW) DNA from Magnaporthaceae (Ascomycota) fungal mycelium intended for whole genome sequencing. The Cytiva Nucleon PhytoPure and the Macherey-Nagel NucleoBond HMW DNA kits were selected because the former requires lower amounts of starting material and the latter utilizes gentler methods to maximize DNA length, albeit at a higher requirement for input material. The Cytiva Nucleon PhytoPure kit successfully recovered HMW DNA for half of our fungal species by increasing the amount of RNase A treatment and adding in a proteinase K treatment. To reduce the impact of pigmentation development, which occurs toward later stages of culturing, extractions were run in quadruplicate to increase overall DNA concentration. We also adapted the Macherey-Nagel NucleoBond HMW DNA kit for high-quality HMW DNA by grinding the sample to a fine powder, overnight lysis, and splitting the sample before washing the precipitated DNA. For both kits, precipitated DNA was spooled out pre-washing, ensuring a higher percentage of high-integrity long strands. The Macherey-Nagel protocol offers advantages over the first through the utilization of gravity columns that provide gentler treatment, yielding >50% of high-purity DNA strands exceeding 40 kbp. The limitation of this method is the requirement for a large quantity of starting material (1 g). By triaging samples based on the rate of growth relative to the accumulation of secondary metabolites, our methodologies hold promise for yielding reliable and high-quality HMW DNA from a variety of fungal samples, improving sequencing outcomes. \nKey features\n \u2022 Modified protocols for the extraction of high molecular weight fungal DNA suitable for long-read whole genome sequencing. \u2022 Approximately 4 h to complete four samples in parallel (excluding lysis time). \u2022 Optimized for the mycelium of Magnaporthaceae fungi, harvested before melanin (or secondary metabolite) buildup, but readily adaptable for other ascomycetes.",

This report aims to emphasize the importance of considering AMNs in the differential diagnosis of atypical pelvic symptoms, especially when initial evaluations suggest gynecological issues. A 56-year-old female with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia and a total vaginal hysterectomy performed over 20 years prior for abnormal uterine bleeding due to fibroids presented to her gynecologist with a three-week history of vaginal discharge and pelvic pain. Initial gynecological assessments were unremarkable, prompting a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which revealed a markedly dilated, fluid-filled appendix, indicative of a mucinous neoplasm. The patient underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, which confirmed a low-grade AMN with clear margins. Post-surgical follow-up showed no recurrence, and a surveillance colonoscopy one year later revealed a benign tubular adenoma. This case highlights the need to consider AMNs in the differential diagnosis of pelvic symptoms, particularly when initial gynecological evaluations do not identify a clear cause. AMNs can present with symptoms that overlap with those of gynecological conditions, making accurate diagnosis challenging. Effective management through early recognition and surgical intervention is important to prevent complications.

The 2021 Family and Youth Protection Law further restricted access to reproductive health services in an effort to boost birth rates. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the reasons women sought abortions in an illegal context, based on their own experiences. This exploratory qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 46 women in Kermanshah, Iran, between April and August 2024. All participants had experienced incomplete abortions after undergoing unsafe procedures. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and thematic analysis with MAXQDA 10 software to identify key themes in the women's experiences. To ensure the study's rigor, we applied Guba and Lincoln\u2019s criteria, including credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability. Five main themes emerged from the interviews: economic hardship, pursuit of a prosperous life, unstable marital relationships, health and fertility issues, and cultural factors. Economic challenges, such as unemployment and lack of basic necessities, were the most frequently cited reasons for seeking unsafe abortions. Health issues, including unplanned pregnancies and fear of fetal anomalies, also played a significant role, alongside cultural stigmas related to age, illegitimacy, and gender preferences. This study sheds light on the multifaceted factors driving unsafe abortions in Iran following pronatalist policy changes. A holistic approach is recommended to address the interconnected economic, social, and cultural challenges that contribute to this issue. By implementing such comprehensive strategies, policymakers and stakeholders can work to reduce the prevalence of unsafe abortion practices and foster improved health and well-being for women.",

Indeed, they regulate key processes for the proper functioning of the organism and affect the course of human pathologies. Altered expression of individual miRNAs has been shown in most human cancers, endowed with oncogenic or suppressor potential. Additionally, miRNAs have shown a promising potential as cancer markers. Not only miRNAs are present in various body fluids, such as serum and plasma, they also have high biological stability of miRNAs that in turn facilitates their detection. For these reasons, the use of miRNAs detection as non-invasive prognostic and predictive biomarkers in cancer provides new perspectives and strategies for personalized medicine and cancer therapy. This review summarizes the current knowledge supporting the utility of miRNAs as novel early diagnostic and prognostic tool, with a special focus on the effectiveness of miRNAs of the liquid biopsies in the diagnosis of urogenital cancers. In conclusion, we rightly state that circulating miRNAs and therefore liquid biopsy have the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis, monitoring and even treatment of urological tumors, entering clinical practice as a more accurate, less invasive and more suitable diagnostic tool for patient follow-up compared to current methodologies. With the progress of scientific research and the implementation of advanced technologies that also exploit artificial intelligence, the future of oncological diagnosis, especially for urological tumors, could be increasingly oriented towards less invasive approaches and based on precision medicine, tailored for the specific patient.",

We begin by defining what silence is and what a robust right to silence entails. We then argue that the right to silence offers two politically salient epistemic benefits. The first is that, if the right to silence is maintained, we can avoid the epistemic harm that may be caused when an individual is compelled to lie in public. The second is that the right to silence can protect marginalised individuals against the epistemic injustices that may arise when others are likely to misconstrue their speech.",

Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques.

A 56-year-old female with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia and a total vaginal hysterectomy performed over 20 years prior for abnormal uterine bleeding due to fibroids presented to her gynecologist with a three-week history of vaginal discharge and pelvic pain. Initial gynecological assessments were unremarkable, prompting a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which revealed a markedly dilated, fluid-filled appendix, indicative of a mucinous neoplasm. The patient underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, which confirmed a low-grade AMN with clear margins. Post-surgical follow-up showed no recurrence, and a surveillance colonoscopy one year later revealed a benign tubular adenoma. This case highlights the need to consider AMNs in the differential diagnosis of pelvic symptoms, particularly when initial gynecological evaluations do not identify a clear cause.

Furthermore, a systematic review of 14 related cases described in previous studies to analyze the characteristics of metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC) is presented. In total, 14 publications were identified for systematic review. Among these patients, 7 had squamous cell carcinoma. The median age of the patients at the time of initial diagnosis was 49.8 years, and the mean interval between the identification of the primary tumor and metastasis was 46 months. Several clinical manifestations were observed depending on the site of metastasis. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration was revealed as one of the most effective methods for diagnosing mPC. In conclusion, there is currently no consensus regarding subsequent treatment plans. Pancreatic metastases originating from cervical cancer are infrequent and necessitate careful consideration along with individualized treatment approaches.",
            "In Iran, restrictive abortion laws have led to widespread unsafe abortions, posing significant health risks. The 2021 Family and Youth Protection Law further restricted access to reproductive health services in an effort to boost birth rates. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the reasons women sought abortions in an illegal context, based on their own experiences. This exploratory qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 46 women in Kermanshah, Iran, between April and August 2024. All participants had experienced incomplete abortions after undergoing unsafe procedures. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and thematic analysis with MAXQDA 10 software to identify key themes in the women's experiences. To ensure the study's rigor, we applied Guba and Lincoln\u2019s criteria, including credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability. Five main themes emerged from the interviews: economic hardship, pursuit of a prosperous life, unstable marital relationships, health and fertility issues, and cultural factors. Economic challenges, such as unemployment and lack of basic necessities, were the most frequently cited reasons for seeking unsafe abortions. Health issues, including unplanned pregnancies and fear of fetal anomalies, also played a significant role, alongside cultural stigmas related to age, illegitimacy, and gender preferences. This study sheds light on the multifaceted factors driving unsafe abortions in Iran following pronatalist policy changes. A holistic approach is recommended to address the interconnected economic, social, and cultural challenges that contribute to this issue. By implementing such comprehensive strategies, policymakers and stakeholders can work to reduce the prevalence of unsafe abortion practices and foster improved health and well-being for women.",
            "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding, single-stranded RNAs molecules modulating gene expression thanks to their ability to bind mRNAs. Indeed, they regulate key processes for the proper functioning of the organism and affect the course of human pathologies. Altered expression of individual miRNAs has been shown in most human cancers, endowed with oncogenic or suppressor potential. Additionally, miRNAs have shown a promising potential as cancer markers. Not only miRNAs are present in various body fluids, such as serum and plasma, they also have high biological stability of miRNAs that in turn facilitates their detection. For these reasons, the use of miRNAs detection as non-invasive prognostic and predictive biomarkers in cancer provides new perspectives and strategies for personalized medicine and cancer therapy. This review summarizes the current knowledge supporting the utility of miRNAs as novel early diagnostic and prognostic tool, with a special focus on the effectiveness of miRNAs of the liquid biopsies in the diagnosis of urogenital cancers. In conclusion, we rightly state that circulating miRNAs and therefore liquid biopsy have the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis, monitoring and even treatment of urological tumors, entering clinical practice as a more accurate, less invasive and more suitable diagnostic tool for patient follow-up compared to current methodologies. With the progress of scientific research and the implementation of advanced technologies that also exploit artificial intelligence, the future of oncological diagnosis, especially for urological tumors, could be increasingly oriented towards less invasive approaches and based on precision medicine, tailored for the specific patient.",
            "While much ink has been spilt over the political importance of speech, much less has been dedicated to the political importance of silence. This article seeks to fill that gap. We propose the need for a robust, democratic right to silence in public life and argue that there are politically salient epistemic reasons for recognising that right. We begin by defining what silence is and what a robust right to silence entails. We then argue that the right to silence offers two politically salient epistemic benefits. The first is that, if the right to silence is maintained, we can avoid the epistemic harm that may be caused when an individual is compelled to lie in public. The second is that the right to silence can protect marginalised individuals against the epistemic injustices that may arise when others are likely to misconstrue their speech.",
            "The seminal vesicles are an accessory structure of the male reproductive system. The most common pathology associated with the seminal vesicles is infective, and patients may present with haematospermia, pain, and subfertility. Patients presenting with unilateral ureteric obstruction secondary to seminal vesiculitis are rare, and there are very few reported cases in the literature. This case report aims to review the presentation and management of such a case.\nA 59-year-old male presented to the emergency department with right-sided abdominal pain, vomiting, haematuria, and reduced urinary output. Blood tests showed raised inflammatory markers, hyperkalaemia, and a significant acute kidney injury with a creatinine of 695 \u00b5mol/L and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 7 from a normal baseline. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) imaging of the renal tracts identified an atrophic left kidney and a large soft tissue lesion at the level of the distal third of the right ureter, concerning for a primary ureteric malignancy. Notably, urine samples sent for cytology were reported as negative for malignancy. Following drainage and recovery from the acute episode, a timely outpatient ureteroscopy revealed no abnormalities of the ureter, and a subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) concluded right-sided seminal vesiculitis as the cause of this patient\u2019s presentation.\nThis case report demonstrates seminal vesiculitis as a rare cause of ureteric obstruction. It can mimic upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and highlights the importance of a definitive diagnosis in patients with suspected upper renal tract transitional cell carcinoma.",
            "We report the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy with a history of recurrent and severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy with an uncommon clinical presentation. This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

              "content": "Ramp lesions are longitudinal lesions of the meniscocapsular complex of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. These lesions are poorly recognized, difficult to diagnose, and require specific arthroscopic exploration. Ramp lesions are typically associated with anterior cruciate ligament rupture and have important biomechanical consequences as they result in increased anterior tibial translation and external rotation. Suture hook repair through the posteromedial portal is safe and provides a high healing rate. Spontaneous healing of ramp lesions is rarely observed, and repair is indicated for all lesions with the involvement of meniscotibial ligament. The choice of a posteromedial repair technique with vertical suture performed under visual control allows restoration of the continuity of meniscotibial ligament and effective healing of these lesions. Standardized arthroscopic exploration with systematic visualization of the posteromedial compartment using the transnotch technique is a crucial point to diagnose these lesions. The use of transillumination and a needle allows to palpate the lesion with the tip of the needle in case of doubt (hidden lesion) before performing the posteromedial portal safely. By using the transnotch vision and by introducing the instruments through the posteromedial portal, debridement with the shaver and repair with the hook of the lesion are performed under visual control. Vertical repair is performed by taking care to pass the hook through the meniscotibial ligament by perforating the deep face of the capsular portion and anterior portion of the ramp lesion. Similarly, it is recommended not to catch too much meniscal tissue on the anterior margin side to remain in the red zone and not to perforate the meniscus in the avascular zone to avoid secondary lesions caused by the \u201ccheese wire\u201d effect of the sutures in the white zone. This technique has allowed us to reduce our percentage of secondary meniscectomy after ramp lesion repair from 25% using a standard arthroscopic exploration and meniscal repair technique through the anterior portal to 11.3% using a arthroscopic exploration and repair technique through the posteromedial portal at 4 years of follow-up. Systematic use of the transnotch vision and repair through the posteromedial portal are recommended for the management of these lesions, which demonstrate serious mechanical and clinical consequences.",

Some common issues when addressing these injuries surgically include the \u201cbungee-cord\u201d effect seen with implants that sit too far from the tibial plateau surface and loss of tension on the sutures after cycling of the knee after the repair. This video will discuss the presentation of a patient with a medial meniscal root repair treated with a novel technique to counteract these aforementioned issues. Based on the patient\u2019s medial meniscal root tear and minimal arthritis seen on radiograph, he was indicated for a meniscal root repair to prevent meniscal extrusion and reinforce normal meniscal hoop stresses to limit progression of his arthritis. This technique uses a novel re-tensionable all-suture anchor through a transtibial tunnel with 2 repair sutures through the meniscal root that sits just below the tibial plateau, allowing the surgeon the ability to re-tension the implant after cycling the knee. Arthroscopic repair of the medial meniscal root allowed the patient to return to his previous level of activity. In this case, arthroscopic medial meniscal root repair can yield good results in patients to get them back to their previous level of activity while minimizing the chance of rapid arthritic progression that is typically seen with nonoperative management of these injuries.

              "content": "Patellar instability, often associated with medial patellofemoral ligament rupture, is prevalent in adolescents. Risk factors include trochlear dysplasia, patella alta, abnormal patellar tilt, and increased tibial tubercle to trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance. A variety of surgical options are available for addressing patellar instability, and the selection of each technique should be tailored to the unique pathoanatomy of each patient. Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLR) is indicated for patients with patellar instability, and tibial tubercle osteotomy (TTO) is indicated for patients with a TT-TG >20 mm. An anterior midline incision is performed to expose the patella, patellar tendon, and tibial tubercle. Diagnostic arthroscopy is performed to assess patellar engagement and cartilage integrity, followed by the TTO. Three guidewires are placed with 15\u00b0 of obliquity, to guide a 6-cm osteotomy, from medial to lateral and from proximal to distal. A distal cortical hinge must be left intact. A 15-mm medial resection of the tibial tubercle is performed to avoid protrusion against the skin, which is followed by medialization of the tubercle and fixation with K-wires until dynamic testing ensures proper alignment and definitive fixation is achieved with cannulated headless screws. A lateral retinacular lengthening is performed to balance patellar forces. MPFLR is executed using a semitendinosus allograft. The graft is anchored to the patella and drawn through a surgically created plane to the medial femoral condyle. The femoral tunnel is created under fluoroscopy guidance, and the graft is then passed and secured. Graft tension and patellar mobility are adjusted according to dynamic testing. Once patellar stability is achieved and maintained through range of motion, the graft is then fixed. Patients can expect improved clinical outcomes with a high return-to-sports rate following both isolated MPFLR and concomitant TTO. The combination of MPFLR + TTO significantly reduces revision rate, compared to isolated MPFLR in patients with increased TT-TG distance, and enhances postoperative patellofemoral tracking. MPFLR + TTO improves patellofemoral tracking and corrects patellar instability, substantially improving postoperative outcomes compared to MPFLR alone. Patients with patellar instability and an increased TT-TG may be effectively treated with MPFLR + TTO.

The aim of this study was to review the clinical indications for HEF in the management of acute and chronic knee dislocations (KD), tibiofemoral subluxations and knee fracture\u2010dislocations. Five databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, Scopus and SPORTDiscus, were systematically searched.

The most common primary indication for HEF was acute or chronic KD. The most common secondary indications included combined osseous and ligamentous deficiency, associated vascular or soft\u2010tissue injury, status post extensive capsular release for arthrofibrosis, and associated extensor mechanism disruption.

The use of osteotomies to correct malalignment and fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) to address cartilage lesions and patellofemoral dysplasia is a viable treatment option for carefully selected patients. The patient is a 22-year-old woman with medial patellar instability caused by iatrogenic distal femoral external rotation and uncontained grade IV patellofemoral lesions. The patient was indicated for OCA because the lesions were too large for an osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS) and were uncontained and not amenable to autologous chondrocyte implantation. Bipolar OCA also addresses the patient\u2019s patellofemoral dysplasia by restoring a more morphologically normal patellofemoral joint. The external rotation and mild varus deformity are corrected with a biplanar distal femoral osteotomy. Correction of malalignment is necessary prior to OCA transplantation to avoid abnormal graft loading and thereby decrease the risk of graft failure. (1) Diagnostic arthroscopy and fluoroscopic examination under anesthesia. (2) Lateral closing wedge de-rotational distal femoral osteotomy. (3) Bipolar OCA with tibial tubercle osteotomy and removal of hardware. In this case, the patient had significant improvement in her symptoms and had full knee range of motion with a normal gait at 3 months after surgery. Depending on a patient\u2019s preoperative function and the specific pathology, full recovery can take considerably longer. A successful outcome is considered return to activities of daily living without significant pain. Return to higher level athletic activities is significantly more unpredictable. Graft survival of bipolar patellofemoral OCA is variable, and the literature is limited by the small number of procedures performed, but published series range from 60% to 85% at 5 years. A successful outcome in these unique, complex cases depends on good patient selection, preoperative planning, and surgical execution. Patellar instability can be reliably treated when the predisposing anatomical factors are appropriately corrected. Bipolar OCA can provide significant improvement in pain and function, but continues to have the highest rate of graft failure compared with other sites within the knee, and should be considered a salvage operation for patients with significant limitations in activities of daily living.

The position and size of original femoral and tibial tunnels are critical in the surgical decision-making in the setting of revision ACL reconstruction. This video presents a case of stage I revision ACL reconstruction with the use of allograft bone dowels due to increased size and poor position of original fixation tunnels. Indications for staging revision ACL reconstruction include significant tunnel osteolysis or dilation (>14 mm), or any situation in which the previous bone tunnels will interfere with anatomic graft placement and fixation. The patient is placed in the supine position with a standard setup for knee arthroscopy, including lateral thigh post and foot stop for maintained knee flexion at 90\u00b0. After diagnostic arthroscopy, the ACL graft remnant is debrided. The femoral tunnel is then debrided and re-cannulated, followed by reaming with cannulated reamers until adequate cortical chatter is achieved, ensuring the presence of a bleeding rim of bone throughout the tunnel to confirm that the correct diameter reamer has been reached. The appropriately sized bone dowel is inserted along the guide pin until fully seated and flush with lateral wall of the notch. This process is then repeated for the tibial tunnel, accessing the tunnel from the previous incision along the medial tibia. This video presents a technique to achieve adequate bone grafting of previously used tunnels that are not suitable for single-stage revision ACL reconstruction. Patients undergo second-stage revision ACL reconstruction at roughly 4 to 6 months following stage I, when bone graft has fully incorporated on radiographs. Stage I revision ACL reconstruction with tunnel grafting using allograft bone dowels is a minimally invasive method of grafting previously used fixation tunnels to allow for anatomic second-stage graft placement and fixation.

PRP combined with ESWT resulted in faster reduction of knee pain than PRP alone at the 1-month follow-up. Serum IL-33 showed no significant difference at the 12-month follow-up. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-15, and IL-17 increased at the 12-month follow-up, potentially due to the additional training. However, the athletes did not report any discomfort or injuries, and no abnormalities were detected by ultrasonography after study. We demonstrated improvements in pain and functional scores, as well as knee injury protection in athletes, following 12\u00a0months of PRP and PRP with ESWT treatments. The study analyzed the therapeutic effect of PRP injection alone and combining PRP injection with ESWT for chronic patellar tendinopathy. Our results showed that combined treatment can facilitate the pain relief early than PRP alone and is a safety treatment modality. No adverse effect was noted in our study.

              "content": "Previous literature has found that hip magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has lower accuracy and reliability in preoperative diagnosis of cartilage and labral pathology compared with knee and shoulder MRI. This is a notable limitation, as MRI findings play a significant role in the determination for surgical intervention in femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) and aid in surgical planning, intraoperative cartilage management, and in postoperative rehabilitation expectations. Hip arthroscopy is most commonly utilized for the treatment of FAIS and associated labral tears and chondral pathology of varying grades, particularly at the chondrolabral junction. Given the difficulty in assessing chondrolabral pathology on preoperative MRI, we present our preferred method of correlating MRI to intraoperative findings at the chondrolabral junction. Using preoperative MRI and the Outerbridge classification system, we describe our method to assess cartilage injuries and chondrolabral junction pathology in patients who undergo hip arthroscopy for FAIS. We correlate chondral injuries with preoperative MRI to aid surgeons in interpreting the degree of chondral injury from MRI and corresponding surgical findings. Given that MRI of the hip is neither as accurate nor as reliable as MRI of the knee or shoulder, an understanding of how to correlate preoperative MRI with intraoperative appearance can better prepare the surgeon for findings at the chondrolabral junction of the hip. The absence of findings on MRI does not rule out the possibility of cartilage or labral pathology. Intraoperatively, hip cartilage is assessed using either the Outerbridge or Beck classification systems. These classification systems require direct visualization of the hip joint, and full assessment of the chondrolabral junction and associated pathology may not be possible until intra-articular work is complete. While MRI evaluation of the hip is difficult due to the depth of the hip joint, location of the hip relative to the MR magnet, and thinness of the acetabular cartilage, it is a useful tool for preoperative hip joint cartilage assessment, though not as accurate as knee and shoulder MRIs. Understanding the correlation between preoperative hip MRI and intraoperative chondrolabral pathology can aid the surgeon in preparation for hip arthroscopy in the treatment of FAIS.",

Here we show that the depletion of tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), causes synthetic dosage lethality (SDL) in MAD2-overexpressing cells, and we term this cell death MAD2-overexpressing interphase cell death (MOID). The induction of MOID depends on PML and DAXX mediating mitochondrial AIFM1-release. MAD2, TSG101, and AIF-PML-DAXX axis regulate mitochondria, PML nuclear bodies (NBs), and autophagy with close inter-dependent protein stability in survival cells. Loss of C-terminal phosphorylation(s) of TSG101 and closed (C-)MAD2-overexpression contribute to induce MOID. In survival cells, both MAD2 and TSG101 localize at PML NBs in interphase, and TSG101 Y390 phosphorylation is required for localization of TSG101 to PML NBs. PML release from PML NBs through PML deSUMOylation contributes to induce MOID. The post-transcriptional/translational cell death machinery and the non-canonical transcriptional regulation are intricately linked to MOID, and ER-MAM, may serve as a crucial intersection for MOID signaling.",

            "Ramp lesions are longitudinal lesions of the meniscocapsular complex of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. These lesions are poorly recognized, difficult to diagnose, and require specific arthroscopic exploration. Ramp lesions are typically associated with anterior cruciate ligament rupture and have important biomechanical consequences as they result in increased anterior tibial translation and external rotation. Suture hook repair through the posteromedial portal is safe and provides a high healing rate. Spontaneous healing of ramp lesions is rarely observed, and repair is indicated for all lesions with the involvement of meniscotibial ligament. The choice of a posteromedial repair technique with vertical suture performed under visual control allows restoration of the continuity of meniscotibial ligament and effective healing of these lesions. Standardized arthroscopic exploration with systematic visualization of the posteromedial compartment using the transnotch technique is a crucial point to diagnose these lesions. The use of transillumination and a needle allows to palpate the lesion with the tip of the needle in case of doubt (hidden lesion) before performing the posteromedial portal safely. By using the transnotch vision and by introducing the instruments through the posteromedial portal, debridement with the shaver and repair with the hook of the lesion are performed under visual control. Vertical repair is performed by taking care to pass the hook through the meniscotibial ligament by perforating the deep face of the capsular portion and anterior portion of the ramp lesion. Similarly, it is recommended not to catch too much meniscal tissue on the anterior margin side to remain in the red zone and not to perforate the meniscus in the avascular zone to avoid secondary lesions caused by the \u201ccheese wire\u201d effect of the sutures in the white zone. This technique has allowed us to reduce our percentage of secondary meniscectomy after ramp lesion repair from 25% using a standard arthroscopic exploration and meniscal repair technique through the anterior portal to 11.3% using a arthroscopic exploration and repair technique through the posteromedial portal at 4 years of follow-up. Systematic use of the transnotch vision and repair through the posteromedial portal are recommended for the management of these lesions, which demonstrate serious mechanical and clinical consequences.",
            "Medial meniscal root repairs are devastating injuries that can cause long-term knee problems if not properly addressed. Some common issues when addressing these injuries surgically include the \u201cbungee-cord\u201d effect seen with implants that sit too far from the tibial plateau surface and loss of tension on the sutures after cycling of the knee after the repair. This video will discuss the presentation of a patient with a medial meniscal root repair treated with a novel technique to counteract these aforementioned issues. Based on the patient\u2019s medial meniscal root tear and minimal arthritis seen on radiograph, he was indicated for a meniscal root repair to prevent meniscal extrusion and reinforce normal meniscal hoop stresses to limit progression of his arthritis. This technique uses a novel re-tensionable all-suture anchor through a transtibial tunnel with 2 repair sutures through the meniscal root that sits just below the tibial plateau, allowing the surgeon the ability to re-tension the implant after cycling the knee. Arthroscopic repair of the medial meniscal root allowed the patient to return to his previous level of activity. In this case, arthroscopic medial meniscal root repair can yield good results in patients to get them back to their previous level of activity while minimizing the chance of rapid arthritic progression that is typically seen with nonoperative management of these injuries.

            "Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is the most serious type of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) and can be easily confused with other disorders, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombocytopenia syndromes. Timely diagnosis of CAPS poses considerable challenges due to its rarity and the fact that clinicians often lack knowledge of the disease. A 21-year-old patient was 32 weeks and 5 days pregnant when she presented to the hospital with a 7-hour history of sudden onset of left-sided limb weakness with no apparent cause.

            "Patellar instability, often associated with medial patellofemoral ligament rupture, is prevalent in adolescents. Risk factors include trochlear dysplasia, patella alta, abnormal patellar tilt, and increased tibial tubercle to trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance. A variety of surgical options are available for addressing patellar instability, and the selection of each technique should be tailored to the unique pathoanatomy of each patient. Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLR) is indicated for patients with patellar instability, and tibial tubercle osteotomy (TTO) is indicated for patients with a TT-TG >20 mm. An anterior midline incision is performed to expose the patella, patellar tendon, and tibial tubercle. Diagnostic arthroscopy is performed to assess patellar engagement and cartilage integrity, followed by the TTO. Three guidewires are placed with 15\u00b0 of obliquity, to guide a 6-cm osteotomy, from medial to lateral and from proximal to distal. A distal cortical hinge must be left intact. A 15-mm medial resection of the tibial tubercle is performed to avoid protrusion against the skin, which is followed by medialization of the tubercle and fixation with K-wires until dynamic testing ensures proper alignment and definitive fixation is achieved with cannulated headless screws. A lateral retinacular lengthening is performed to balance patellar forces. MPFLR is executed using a semitendinosus allograft. The graft is anchored to the patella and drawn through a surgically created plane to the medial femoral condyle. The femoral tunnel is created under fluoroscopy guidance, and the graft is then passed and secured. Graft tension and patellar mobility are adjusted according to dynamic testing. Once patellar stability is achieved and maintained through range of motion, the graft is then fixed. Patients can expect improved clinical outcomes with a high return-to-sports rate following both isolated MPFLR and concomitant TTO. The combination of MPFLR + TTO significantly reduces revision rate, compared to isolated MPFLR in patients with increased TT-TG distance, and enhances postoperative patellofemoral tracking. MPFLR + TTO improves patellofemoral tracking and corrects patellar instability, substantially improving postoperative outcomes compared to MPFLR alone. Patients with patellar instability and an increased TT-TG may be effectively treated with MPFLR + TTO.

            "While rigid knee\u2010spanning external fixation is more commonly utilized in the treatment of complex knee injuries compared to hinged external fixation (HEF), HEF has the added benefit of providing stability while also permitting early controlled range of motion. However, there is limited existing literature on the indications for HEF of the knee. The aim of this study was to review the clinical indications for HEF in the management of acute and chronic knee dislocations (KD), tibiofemoral subluxations and knee fracture\u2010dislocations. Five databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, Scopus and SPORTDiscus, were systematically searched. Included studies were those that involved comparative or non\u2010comparative evaluation of patients with an HEF applied for an acute or chronic KD, tibiofemoral subluxation or knee fracture\u2010dislocation. Fourteen studies ranging from 1998 to 2023 met inclusion criteria, with a total of 184 knees treated with HEF for an acute or chronic KD, tibiofemoral subluxation, or knee fracture\u2010dislocation. The most common primary indication for HEF was acute or chronic KD. The most common secondary indications included combined osseous and ligamentous deficiency, associated vascular or soft\u2010tissue injury, status post extensive capsular release for arthrofibrosis, and associated extensor mechanism disruption. While uncommon, HEF is a valuable option in the treatment of complex knee injuries where both stability and controlled mobilization are essential. Due to limitations in the available evidence, further high\u2010quality research is needed to establish guidelines for the utilization of HEF about the knee. Level IV.",
            "Patellar instability with symptomatic cartilage lesions in young patients is a challenging problem to treat. The use of osteotomies to correct malalignment and fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) to address cartilage lesions and patellofemoral dysplasia is a viable treatment option for carefully selected patients. The patient is a 22-year-old woman with medial patellar instability caused by iatrogenic distal femoral external rotation and uncontained grade IV patellofemoral lesions. The patient was indicated for OCA because the lesions were too large for an osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS) and were uncontained and not amenable to autologous chondrocyte implantation. Bipolar OCA also addresses the patient\u2019s patellofemoral dysplasia by restoring a more morphologically normal patellofemoral joint. The external rotation and mild varus deformity are corrected with a biplanar distal femoral osteotomy. Correction of malalignment is necessary prior to OCA transplantation to avoid abnormal graft loading and thereby decrease the risk of graft failure. (1) Diagnostic arthroscopy and fluoroscopic examination under anesthesia. (2) Lateral closing wedge de-rotational distal femoral osteotomy. (3) Bipolar OCA with tibial tubercle osteotomy and removal of hardware. In this case, the patient had significant improvement in her symptoms and had full knee range of motion with a normal gait at 3 months after surgery. Depending on a patient\u2019s preoperative function and the specific pathology, full recovery can take considerably longer. A successful outcome is considered return to activities of daily living without significant pain. Return to higher level athletic activities is significantly more unpredictable. Graft survival of bipolar patellofemoral OCA is variable, and the literature is limited by the small number of procedures performed, but published series range from 60% to 85% at 5 years. A successful outcome in these unique, complex cases depends on good patient selection, preoperative planning, and surgical execution. Patellar instability can be reliably treated when the predisposing anatomical factors are appropriately corrected. Bipolar OCA can provide significant improvement in pain and function, but continues to have the highest rate of graft failure compared with other sites within the knee, and should be considered a salvage operation for patients with significant limitations in activities of daily living.

            "When evaluating a patient with a failed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, a detailed history and physical examination is paramount. The position and size of original femoral and tibial tunnels are critical in the surgical decision-making in the setting of revision ACL reconstruction. This video presents a case of stage I revision ACL reconstruction with the use of allograft bone dowels due to increased size and poor position of original fixation tunnels. Indications for staging revision ACL reconstruction include significant tunnel osteolysis or dilation (>14 mm), or any situation in which the previous bone tunnels will interfere with anatomic graft placement and fixation. The patient is placed in the supine position with a standard setup for knee arthroscopy, including lateral thigh post and foot stop for maintained knee flexion at 90\u00b0. After diagnostic arthroscopy, the ACL graft remnant is debrided. The femoral tunnel is then debrided and re-cannulated, followed by reaming with cannulated reamers until adequate cortical chatter is achieved, ensuring the presence of a bleeding rim of bone throughout the tunnel to confirm that the correct diameter reamer has been reached. The appropriately sized bone dowel is inserted along the guide pin until fully seated and flush with lateral wall of the notch. This process is then repeated for the tibial tunnel, accessing the tunnel from the previous incision along the medial tibia. This video presents a technique to achieve adequate bone grafting of previously used tunnels that are not suitable for single-stage revision ACL reconstruction. Patients undergo second-stage revision ACL reconstruction at roughly 4 to 6 months following stage I, when bone graft has fully incorporated on radiographs. Stage I revision ACL reconstruction with tunnel grafting using allograft bone dowels is a minimally invasive method of grafting previously used fixation tunnels to allow for anatomic second-stage graft placement and fixation.

            "Patellar tendinopathy, also known as jumper\u2019s knee, can significantly impact the quality of daily life for patients due to the associated pain. A randomized controlled trial was investigated the clinical, sonographic, and serum cytokine markers in patellar tendinopathy of athletes following platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or PRP with extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) treatments. Our aims to investigate and compare therapeutic effects of PRP versus a combination of PRP with ESWT for treating patellar tendinopathy. A total of 33 athletes with patellar tendinopathy were randomized into two groups. PRP\u2009+\u2009Sham (PS) group received intraarticular injection of autologous PRP (5\u00a0mL) once and sham ESWT. PRP\u2009+\u2009ESWT (PE) group received intraarticular injection of autologous PRP once and after 1\u00a0week ESWT (0.2\u00a0mJ/mm Autologous PRP injection and its combination with ESWT are both effective treatments for chronic patellar tendinopathy in athletes. PRP combined with ESWT resulted in faster reduction of knee pain than PRP alone at the 1-month follow-up. Serum IL-33 showed no significant difference at the 12-month follow-up. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-15, and IL-17 increased at the 12-month follow-up, potentially due to the additional training. However, the athletes did not report any discomfort or injuries, and no abnormalities were detected by ultrasonography after study. We demonstrated improvements in pain and functional scores, as well as knee injury protection in athletes, following 12\u00a0months of PRP and PRP with ESWT treatments. The study analyzed the therapeutic effect of PRP injection alone and combining PRP injection with ESWT for chronic patellar tendinopathy. Our results showed that combined treatment can facilitate the pain relief early than PRP alone and is a safety treatment modality. No adverse effect was noted in our study.

            "Previous literature has found that hip magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has lower accuracy and reliability in preoperative diagnosis of cartilage and labral pathology compared with knee and shoulder MRI. This is a notable limitation, as MRI findings play a significant role in the determination for surgical intervention in femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) and aid in surgical planning, intraoperative cartilage management, and in postoperative rehabilitation expectations. Hip arthroscopy is most commonly utilized for the treatment of FAIS and associated labral tears and chondral pathology of varying grades, particularly at the chondrolabral junction. Given the difficulty in assessing chondrolabral pathology on preoperative MRI, we present our preferred method of correlating MRI to intraoperative findings at the chondrolabral junction. Using preoperative MRI and the Outerbridge classification system, we describe our method to assess cartilage injuries and chondrolabral junction pathology in patients who undergo hip arthroscopy for FAIS. We correlate chondral injuries with preoperative MRI to aid surgeons in interpreting the degree of chondral injury from MRI and corresponding surgical findings. Given that MRI of the hip is neither as accurate nor as reliable as MRI of the knee or shoulder, an understanding of how to correlate preoperative MRI with intraoperative appearance can better prepare the surgeon for findings at the chondrolabral junction of the hip. The absence of findings on MRI does not rule out the possibility of cartilage or labral pathology. Intraoperatively, hip cartilage is assessed using either the Outerbridge or Beck classification systems. These classification systems require direct visualization of the hip joint, and full assessment of the chondrolabral junction and associated pathology may not be possible until intra-articular work is complete. While MRI evaluation of the hip is difficult due to the depth of the hip joint, location of the hip relative to the MR magnet, and thinness of the acetabular cartilage, it is a useful tool for preoperative hip joint cartilage assessment, though not as accurate as knee and shoulder MRIs. Understanding the correlation between preoperative hip MRI and intraoperative chondrolabral pathology can aid the surgeon in preparation for hip arthroscopy in the treatment of FAIS.",
            "Overexpression of mitotic arrest deficiency 2 (MAD2/MAD2L1), a pivotal component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), resulted in many types of cancer. Here we show that the depletion of tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), causes synthetic dosage lethality (SDL) in MAD2-overexpressing cells, and we term this cell death MAD2-overexpressing interphase cell death (MOID). The induction of MOID depends on PML and DAXX mediating mitochondrial AIFM1-release. MAD2, TSG101, and AIF-PML-DAXX axis regulate mitochondria, PML nuclear bodies (NBs), and autophagy with close inter-dependent protein stability in survival cells. Loss of C-terminal phosphorylation(s) of TSG101 and closed (C-)MAD2-overexpression contribute to induce MOID. In survival cells, both MAD2 and TSG101 localize at PML NBs in interphase, and TSG101 Y390 phosphorylation is required for localization of TSG101 to PML NBs. PML release from PML NBs through PML deSUMOylation contributes to induce MOID. The post-transcriptional/translational cell death machinery and the non-canonical transcriptional regulation are intricately linked to MOID, and ER-MAM, may serve as a crucial intersection for MOID signaling.",
            "This study aims to present a case of cerebellar dysplastic ganglioneuroma, which is commonly referred to as Lhermitte\u2013Duclos disease (LDD). Furthermore, the study aims to provide an extensive review of the essential aspects of LDD, thereby providing essential information for its accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. A 54-year-old woman was admitted with symptoms of headache, facial numbness, and a visible cerebellar mass. Imaging studies revealed specific features such as the \u201ctiger stripe sign\u201d on magnetic resonance imaging, including hydrocephalus compression and abnormal vasculature. The diagnosis of LDD was made. The cerebellar mass was resected via a paracentral approach. The patient underwent surgery for a cerebellar dysplastic ganglion cell tumor (WHO grade I), confirmed by postoperative pathology. Despite sub-complete resection with minor residuals, the patient experienced significant improvement in symptoms. A postoperative computed tomography scan revealed a large cavity with frontal lobe hemorrhage. PTEN gene testing was recommended but declined due to financial constraints. The patient was discharged without complications. LDD presents both benign and tumor characteristics, with a low likelihood of malignancy. Total resection is the recommended treatment, although challenges in complete excision may lead to recurrence. The importance of considering Cowden syndrome and genetic testing, particularly the PTEN gene, in patients with LDD, is emphasized. Long-term follow-up care is crucial for monitoring recurrence and related conditions.",

However, the volume and complexity of EHR messages have increased health workers' cognitive load, impeding effective care delivery and contributing to burnout. To understand these potential detriments resulting from EHR communication, we analyzed EHR messages sent between patients and health workers at Emory Healthcare, a large academic healthcare system in Atlanta, Georgia. We quantified the burden of messages interacted with by each health worker type and visualized the communication patterns using graph theory. Our analysis included 76,694 conversations comprising 144,369 messages sent between 47,460 patients and 3,749 health workers across 85 healthcare specialties. On average, nurses/certified nursing assistants/medical assistants (nurses/CNA/MA) interacted with the most messages (350), followed by non-physician practitioners (NPP) (241), physicians (166), and support staff (155), with the average conversation involving 10.51 interactions before resolution. Network analysis of the communication flow revealed that each health worker was connected to approximately two other health workers (average degree = 2.10). In message sending, support staff led in closeness centrality (0.44), followed by nurses/CNA/MA (0.41), highlighting their key role in fast information spread. For message reception, nurses/CNA/MA (0.51) and support staff (0.41) also had the highest values, underscoring their vital role in the communication network on the receiving end as well. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of applying graph theory to understand communication dynamics between patients and health workers and highlights the burden of EHR-based messaging.",

To explore primary care clinicians' information\u2010seeking behaviour at point\u2010of\u2010care, focusing on when and how they seek answers to clinical questions. Semi\u2010structured interviews were conducted with 45 clinicians after clinical sessions to investigate their information\u2010seeking habits. Follow\u2010up interviews were conducted after a week for those intending to address unanswered queries. Two thirds of clinicians encountered questions during care, with nearly three quarters resolving them during the session. Colleagues, guidelines and online platforms were common information sources, with smartphones being used to access Google, WhatsApp or UpToDate\u00ae. Facilitators included reliable sources and the drive to confirm knowledge, while barriers included ineffective search methods and high workload. Despite challenges, most clinicians expressed satisfaction with their information\u2010seeking process. The findings underscore the increasing use of smartphones for accessing clinical information among Singaporean primary care clinicians and suggest the need for tailored training programmes and guidelines to optimise information\u2010seeking practices.

While most of these studies used task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there is an increasing interest in resting-state fMRI to characterize aberrant network dynamics involved in this and other MDD-associated symptoms. It has been proposed that activity during the resting-state represents characteristics of brain-wide functional organization, which could be highly relevant for the efficient execution of cognitive tasks. However, the dynamics linking resting-state properties and task-evoked activity remain poorly understood. Therefore, the present study investigated the association between spontaneous activity as indicated by the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) at rest and activity during an emotional n-back task. 60 patients diagnosed with an acute MDD episode, and 52 healthy controls underwent the fMRI scanning procedure. Within both groups, positive correlations between spontaneous activity at rest and task-activation were found in core regions of the central-executive network (CEN), whereas spontaneous activity correlated negatively with task-deactivation in regions of the default mode network (DMN). Compared to healthy controls, patients showed a decreased rest-task correlation in the left prefrontal cortex (CEN) and an increased negative correlation in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (DMN). Interestingly, no significant group-differences within those regions were found solely at rest or during the task. The results underpin the potential value and importance of resting-state markers for the understanding of dysfunctional network dynamics and neural substrates of cognitive processing.",

To optimise trial implementation, we investigated contextual fit with key local stakeholders. We used scenario\u2010based interviews with 17 health workers and four district managers to explore perceived feasibility. Eighteen policymakers were also surveyed to explore policy coherence, demand, acceptability, evidence needs, opportunities and risks. The Bowen feasibility framework and an access to health care framework were adapted and applied. Health workers perceived the MAMI Care Pathway as feasible to implement with support to access services and provide care. The approach is acceptable, given consistency with national policies, local protocols and potential to improve routine care quality. Demand for more comprehensive, preventive and person\u2010centred outpatient care was driven by concerns about unmet, hidden and costly care burden for health services and families. Inpatient care only for severe wasting treatment is inaccessible and unacceptable. Support for routine and expanded components, especially maternal mental health, is needed for successful implementation. Wider contextual factors may affect implementation fidelity and strength. Policymakers cautiously welcomed the approach, which resonates with national commitments, policies and plans but need evidence on how it can work within varied, complex contexts without further system overstretch. A responsive, pragmatic randomised controlled trial will generate the most useful evidence for policymakers. Findings have informed trial preparation and implementation, including a realist evaluation to contextualise outcomes.",

They completed self\u2010reported questionnaires to assess subjective sleep and emotional distress. A sleep diary was used to evaluate subjective sleep parameters. All participants performed the emotional Stroop task (three blocks each of negative emotional, sleep\u2010related, and neutral words) during functional magnetic resonance imaging assessments. We compared brain activation during the emotional Stroop task between the two groups. We also analysed the correlations between altered neural activation and sleep variables. Less neural activation was detected in the right anterior prefrontal cortex of patients with chronic insomnia disorder than in controls when performing the emotional Stroop task with negative emotional words. The decrease in neural activation was negatively correlated with scores on Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, and Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale. In contrast, they were positively correlated with subjective total sleep time and sleep efficiency as reported in sleep diaries. A decrease in right anterior prefrontal cortex activity under the negative emotional words condition of the emotional Stroop task in patients with chronic insomnia disorder suggests a failure of top\u2010down inhibition of negative emotional stimuli.

Anxiety and depression are common among individuals undergoing ART, highlighting the need for integrated mental health support, especially for women who face heightened risk of psychiatric disorders during their reproductive years. Despite the importance of psychiatric care, there is limited knowledge regarding the use of psychiatric medications among individuals undergoing ART. Following a pre-written protocol (osf.io/egxw8/), we systematically searched electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, PsycInfo, Scopus) up to 15.02.2025 to identify any study focused on psychopharmacotherapy among people undergoing ART. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, performed data extraction, and resolved conflicts through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. We synthesized data using descriptive analysis and performed analysis within the following subgroups: (1) group of medication according to Neuroscience-based Nomenclature (NbN) classes; (2) indication for using a specific medication (psychiatric / non-psychiatric). We included 29 studies published in 31 papers. Psychiatric medications were primarily administered for the treatment of depression (n=12/29 studies, 41.38%) and anxiety disorders (n=8/29, 27.59%). Among all groups of medication serotonin reuptake inhibitors were the most commonly studied class of medications (n=15/29 studies, 51.72%), with fluoxetine being the most frequently used medication (n=8/29, 27.59%). Among medications for anxiety, GABA Positive Allosteric Modulators with midazolam occurred the most frequently (n=6/29, 20.69%). Medications for psychosis included single drugs: olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, haloperidol, and promethazine. Among medications that could be used in bipolar disorder there were: valproic acid, lithium, and lamotrigine. The most commonly reported endpoints in the studies were psychiatric symptom severity (n=11/29, 37.93%) and ART efficacy (n=10/29, 34.48%). Evidence on the use of psychopharmacotherapy in ART primarily concerns women. Available literature indicates that psychopharmacotherapy for individuals undergoing ART frequently involves medications commonly used in general psychiatric practice, with a tendency toward lower dosing and a preference for serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, this observation should be interpreted cautiously, as current evidence remains limited and further research is warranted to establish treatment patterns more conclusively.

This educational paper from the International League Against Epilepsy's (ILAE) Big Data Commission aims to help clinicians caring for people with epilepsy become familiar with how Big Data is collected and processed, how they are applied to studies using AI, and outline the immense potential positive impact Big Data can have on diagnosis and management.",
            "The electronic health record (EHR) has greatly expanded healthcare communication between patients and health workers. However, the volume and complexity of EHR messages have increased health workers' cognitive load, impeding effective care delivery and contributing to burnout. To understand these potential detriments resulting from EHR communication, we analyzed EHR messages sent between patients and health workers at Emory Healthcare, a large academic healthcare system in Atlanta, Georgia. We quantified the burden of messages interacted with by each health worker type and visualized the communication patterns using graph theory. Our analysis included 76,694 conversations comprising 144,369 messages sent between 47,460 patients and 3,749 health workers across 85 healthcare specialties. On average, nurses/certified nursing assistants/medical assistants (nurses/CNA/MA) interacted with the most messages (350), followed by non-physician practitioners (NPP) (241), physicians (166), and support staff (155), with the average conversation involving 10.51 interactions before resolution. Network analysis of the communication flow revealed that each health worker was connected to approximately two other health workers (average degree = 2.10). In message sending, support staff led in closeness centrality (0.44), followed by nurses/CNA/MA (0.41), highlighting their key role in fast information spread. For message reception, nurses/CNA/MA (0.51) and support staff (0.41) also had the highest values, underscoring their vital role in the communication network on the receiving end as well. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of applying graph theory to understand communication dynamics between patients and health workers and highlights the burden of EHR-based messaging.",
            "Clinicians' information\u2010seeking behaviours impact patient care quality. Earlier studies indicated that barriers to accessing information deter clinicians from seeking answers to clinical questions. To explore primary care clinicians' information\u2010seeking behaviour at point\u2010of\u2010care, focusing on when and how they seek answers to clinical questions. Semi\u2010structured interviews were conducted with 45 clinicians after clinical sessions to investigate their information\u2010seeking habits. Follow\u2010up interviews were conducted after a week for those intending to address unanswered queries. Two thirds of clinicians encountered questions during care, with nearly three quarters resolving them during the session. Colleagues, guidelines and online platforms were common information sources, with smartphones being used to access Google, WhatsApp or UpToDate\u00ae. Facilitators included reliable sources and the drive to confirm knowledge, while barriers included ineffective search methods and high workload. Despite challenges, most clinicians expressed satisfaction with their information\u2010seeking process. The findings underscore the increasing use of smartphones for accessing clinical information among Singaporean primary care clinicians and suggest the need for tailored training programmes and guidelines to optimise information\u2010seeking practices. Insights from this study can inform the development of training programmes and guidelines aimed at improving information\u2010seeking practices among primary care clinicians, potentially enhancing patient care quality.",
            "Previous investigations have revealed performance deficits and altered neural processes during working-memory (WM) tasks in major depressive disorder (MDD). While most of these studies used task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there is an increasing interest in resting-state fMRI to characterize aberrant network dynamics involved in this and other MDD-associated symptoms. It has been proposed that activity during the resting-state represents characteristics of brain-wide functional organization, which could be highly relevant for the efficient execution of cognitive tasks. However, the dynamics linking resting-state properties and task-evoked activity remain poorly understood. Therefore, the present study investigated the association between spontaneous activity as indicated by the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) at rest and activity during an emotional n-back task. 60 patients diagnosed with an acute MDD episode, and 52 healthy controls underwent the fMRI scanning procedure. Within both groups, positive correlations between spontaneous activity at rest and task-activation were found in core regions of the central-executive network (CEN), whereas spontaneous activity correlated negatively with task-deactivation in regions of the default mode network (DMN). Compared to healthy controls, patients showed a decreased rest-task correlation in the left prefrontal cortex (CEN) and an increased negative correlation in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (DMN). Interestingly, no significant group-differences within those regions were found solely at rest or during the task. The results underpin the potential value and importance of resting-state markers for the understanding of dysfunctional network dynamics and neural substrates of cognitive processing.",
            "An integrated care pathway to manage small and nutritionally at\u2010risk infants under 6 months (u6m) and their mothers (MAMI Care Pathway) is consistent with 2023 WHO malnutrition guidelines and is being tested in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in Ethiopia. To optimise trial implementation, we investigated contextual fit with key local stakeholders. We used scenario\u2010based interviews with 17 health workers and four district managers to explore perceived feasibility. Eighteen policymakers were also surveyed to explore policy coherence, demand, acceptability, evidence needs, opportunities and risks. The Bowen feasibility framework and an access to health care framework were adapted and applied. Health workers perceived the MAMI Care Pathway as feasible to implement with support to access services and provide care. The approach is acceptable, given consistency with national policies, local protocols and potential to improve routine care quality. Demand for more comprehensive, preventive and person\u2010centred outpatient care was driven by concerns about unmet, hidden and costly care burden for health services and families. Inpatient care only for severe wasting treatment is inaccessible and unacceptable. Support for routine and expanded components, especially maternal mental health, is needed for successful implementation. Wider contextual factors may affect implementation fidelity and strength. Policymakers cautiously welcomed the approach, which resonates with national commitments, policies and plans but need evidence on how it can work within varied, complex contexts without further system overstretch. A responsive, pragmatic randomised controlled trial will generate the most useful evidence for policymakers. Findings have informed trial preparation and implementation, including a realist evaluation to contextualise outcomes.",

            "This study investigated the altered neural activation underlying cognitive control under emotional and sleep\u2010related interference conditions and its role in subjective sleep disturbance in patients with chronic insomnia disorder. In total, 48 patients with chronic insomnia disorder, and 48 age\u2010, sex\u2010 and body mass index\u2010matched controls were included in this study. They completed self\u2010reported questionnaires to assess subjective sleep and emotional distress. A sleep diary was used to evaluate subjective sleep parameters. All participants performed the emotional Stroop task (three blocks each of negative emotional, sleep\u2010related, and neutral words) during functional magnetic resonance imaging assessments. We compared brain activation during the emotional Stroop task between the two groups. We also analysed the correlations between altered neural activation and sleep variables. Less neural activation was detected in the right anterior prefrontal cortex of patients with chronic insomnia disorder than in controls when performing the emotional Stroop task with negative emotional words. The decrease in neural activation was negatively correlated with scores on Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, and Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale. In contrast, they were positively correlated with subjective total sleep time and sleep efficiency as reported in sleep diaries. A decrease in right anterior prefrontal cortex activity under the negative emotional words condition of the emotional Stroop task in patients with chronic insomnia disorder suggests a failure of top\u2010down inhibition of negative emotional stimuli. This failure induces disinhibition of cognitive hyperarousal, manifested as rumination or intrusive worries, and potentially causing subjective sleep disturbances.",

            "Emergency physicians have the highest rates of burnout among all specialties. Existing burnout tools include the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and single\u2010item measures from the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). While both were designed to measure burnout, how they conceptualize this phenomenon differs and their agreement is unclear. Given the close conceptual relationship between emotional regulation strategies such as distancing and distraction with the MBI subscale of depersonalization, we examined agreement between the two inventories and association with emotional regulation strategies as a lens to explore the conceptualization of burnout. We conducted a cross\u2010sectional survey of adult and pediatric emergency physicians and trainees in Canada. Survey questions were pretested using written feedback and cognitive interviews. \u201cFrequent use\u201d of an emotional regulation strategy was \u201cmost\u201d or \u201call\u201d shifts (\u22654 on 5\u2010point Likert scale). Burnout was defined as mean \u226550/100 on the CBI and scoring \u22655 (out of 7) on at least one of the single\u2010item measures from the MBI. Associations with burnout were examined using multivariable logistic regression. Of 147 respondents, 44.2% were positive for burnout on the CBI and 44.9% on the single\u2010item measures from the MBI. Disagreement was 21.1% overall, ranging from 12.5% for older (\u226555\u2009years) physicians to 30.2% for younger (<35\u2009years) physicians. Use of distraction and use of distancing were strongly associated with burnout on the single\u2010item measures (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 14.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4\u201360.8]) and CBI (aOR 10.1, 95% CI 2.5\u201339.8, respectively. Despite near\u2010equal rates of burnout, agreement between the CBI and single\u2010item measures from the MBI varies and was lower for younger emergency physicians/trainees. While emotional regulation strategies were felt to be important in supporting a career in emergency medicine, they were strongly associated with burnout.

            "Health and health behaviors in midlife are important determinants of healthy aging. There is evidence of unmet needs for health-promoting information for women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and women with low literacy. This study aimed to (1) develop accessible short, animated videos viewable and downloadable from YouTube aimed at promoting positive health behaviors in women in midlife and (2) evaluate their accessibility, acceptability, understanding, and usability and whether this was influenced by the level of education or socioeconomic disadvantage. In collaboration with a video production company, a multidisciplinary team of academics and health professionals developed 2 short, animated videos on self-management of menopause health and 2 promoting joint health. Their accessibility, acceptability, understanding, and usability to women were evaluated in an anonymous web-based survey. A total of 490 women viewed the videos and responded to the survey. Of these, 353 (72%) completed all questions. Almost all (from 321/353, 91% to 334/363, 92%) agreed that the information in the videos was \u201cvery easy to understand.\u201d The proportions reporting that all or some of the information in the video was new to them varied between videos from 36% (137/386) to 66% (233/353), the reported likelihood of using the practical tips offered in the videos varied from 70% (271/386) to 89% (331/373), and between 61% (235/386) and 70% (263/373) of respondents stated that they would recommend the videos to others.

            "One in six people experience infertility, often leading couples to seek Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), which can be emotionally taxing. Anxiety and depression are common among individuals undergoing ART, highlighting the need for integrated mental health support, especially for women who face heightened risk of psychiatric disorders during their reproductive years. Despite the importance of psychiatric care, there is limited knowledge regarding the use of psychiatric medications among individuals undergoing ART. Following a pre-written protocol (osf.io/egxw8/), we systematically searched electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, PsycInfo, Scopus) up to 15.02.2025 to identify any study focused on psychopharmacotherapy among people undergoing ART. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, performed data extraction, and resolved conflicts through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. We synthesized data using descriptive analysis and performed analysis within the following subgroups: (1) group of medication according to Neuroscience-based Nomenclature (NbN) classes; (2) indication for using a specific medication (psychiatric / non-psychiatric). We included 29 studies published in 31 papers. Psychiatric medications were primarily administered for the treatment of depression (n=12/29 studies, 41.38%) and anxiety disorders (n=8/29, 27.59%). Among all groups of medication serotonin reuptake inhibitors were the most commonly studied class of medications (n=15/29 studies, 51.72%), with fluoxetine being the most frequently used medication (n=8/29, 27.59%). Among medications for anxiety, GABA Positive Allosteric Modulators with midazolam occurred the most frequently (n=6/29, 20.69%). Medications for psychosis included single drugs: olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, haloperidol, and promethazine. Among medications that could be used in bipolar disorder there were: valproic acid, lithium, and lamotrigine. The most commonly reported endpoints in the studies were psychiatric symptom severity (n=11/29, 37.93%) and ART efficacy (n=10/29, 34.48%). Evidence on the use of psychopharmacotherapy in ART primarily concerns women. Available literature indicates that psychopharmacotherapy for individuals undergoing ART frequently involves medications commonly used in general psychiatric practice, with a tendency toward lower dosing and a preference for serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, this observation should be interpreted cautiously, as current evidence remains limited and further research is warranted to establish treatment patterns more conclusively. The variability in study designs and reporting standards further highlights the need for standardized methodologies and improved adherence to reporting guidelines to enhance the quality and applicability of future research.

We produced monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against  S. mansoni The LFTS demonstrated a limit of detection (LoD) of 3 ng/ml. The sensitivity and specificity of the developed LFTS were found to be 96.7% and 95%, respectively, compared to 85% and 90% for the POC-CCA detection kit. The cases were divided into groups based on egg count in the stool, categorized as light, moderate, and heavy infections. The sensitivity of the LFTS in the group with light infection was higher than that of the POC-CCA. When using the KK technique (eggs per gram of stool sample [EPG]) as the reference test, the kappa value for the nano-based strips was 0.902, compared to 0.672 for the CCA strips, indicating an almost perfect agreement between KK and our developed LFTS. These results confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the LFTS compared to commercially available kits for rapid, sensitive, and early diagnosis of schistosomiasis.

In the absence of an approved ZIKV vaccine, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide an option for the prevention and treatment of ZIKV infection. Previous studies identified a potent neutralizing human mAb ZIKV-117 that reduced fetal infection and death in mice following ZIKV challenge. In this study, we report exquisite potency of ZIKV-117-LALA-YTE, which has been engineered to reduce Fc receptor binding and to extend half-life, in a titration study in rhesus macaques to protect against ZIKV challenge. We show complete protection at a dose of 0.016 mg/kg ZIKV-117-LALA-YTE, which resulted in median serum concentrations of 0.13 \u00b5g/mL. The high potency of this mAb supports its potential clinical development as a novel biotherapeutic intervention for ZIKV. In this study, we report the potency of the Zika virus (ZIKV)-specific neutralizing antibody ZIKV-117-LALA-YTE against ZIKV challenge in a titration study rhesus macaques.

To explore the impact of the pandemic on the AMS workforce in Scottish acute care hospitals. Individual, semi-structured online interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of clinical staff who had an AMS focused role in Scottish Health Boards. Interviews explored staff experiences of facilitating AMS during the pandemic. Data were analysed using inductive content analysis. Thirteen staff from seven of 15 Scotland Health Boards participated. The data revealed negative (including staff redeployment and shortages) and positive effects (including improved working relationships and use of technology) on the AMS workforce. Notably, greater appreciation of the work of the AMS team was a positive outcome. The robust qualitative methods applied in this original study have generated greater understanding of factors that impeded AMS services in Scotland during the pandemic. These findings may resonate internationally. Adaptation to technology and investment in the workforce are recommended to improve the resilience of AMS services in future crises.",

Prime boost immunization of adult IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice with the MVA-VP2 vaccine candidate induced high titers of EHDV-8-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and conferred full protection against homologous lethal challenge with EHDV-8. However, no heterologous protection was observed after lethal challenge with EHDV-6. In contrast, the MVA-VP7 vaccine candidate elicited strong cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell responses against VP7 and conferred complete protection against lethal challenge with either EHDV-8 or EHDV-6 in IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice in the absence of NAbs, being the first multiserotype vaccine candidate against EHDV. Moreover, we expressed recombinant proteins VP2 and VP7 of EHDV in the baculovirus expression system, which were used to analyze the potential DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) character of these vaccine candidates. Emergence and re-emergence of arthropod-borne viruses are major concerns for both human and animal health. The most recent example is the fast expansion of EHDV-8 through Europe. Besides, EHDV-8 relates with a high prevalence of pathologic cases in cattle populations. No vaccine is currently available in Europe, and vaccine research against this arboviral disease is negligible. In this work, we present novel DIVA vaccine candidates against EHDV, and most importantly, we identified the protein VP7 of EHDV as an antigen capable of inducing multiserotype protection, one of the major challenges in vaccine research against orbiviruses.",

The 2021 Family and Youth Protection Law further restricted access to reproductive health services in an effort to boost birth rates. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the reasons women sought abortions in an illegal context, based on their own experiences. This exploratory qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 46 women in Kermanshah, Iran, between April and August 2024. All participants had experienced incomplete abortions after undergoing unsafe procedures. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and thematic analysis with MAXQDA 10 software to identify key themes in the women's experiences. To ensure the study's rigor, we applied Guba and Lincoln\u2019s criteria, including credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability. Five main themes emerged from the interviews: economic hardship, pursuit of a prosperous life, unstable marital relationships, health and fertility issues, and cultural factors. Economic challenges, such as unemployment and lack of basic necessities, were the most frequently cited reasons for seeking unsafe abortions. Health issues, including unplanned pregnancies and fear of fetal anomalies, also played a significant role, alongside cultural stigmas related to age, illegitimacy, and gender preferences. This study sheds light on the multifaceted factors driving unsafe abortions in Iran following pronatalist policy changes. A holistic approach is recommended to address the interconnected economic, social, and cultural challenges that contribute to this issue. By implementing such comprehensive strategies, policymakers and stakeholders can work to reduce the prevalence of unsafe abortion practices and foster improved health and well-being for women.",

A retrospective quantitative analysis was conducted by merging healthcare billing records with cause of death data. The term \u201cCOVID-19 associated death\u201d was defined as any death occurring within a defined timeframe following a confirmed contact with COVID-19. This category includes individuals who died directly due to COVID-19, with COVID-19 as a contributing factor, or as an aftermath of a COVID-19 infection, as well as those who died from other causes but had previously contracted COVID-19. This broader definition provides a more comprehensive measure of excess mortality compared to the officially confirmed COVID-19 deaths attributed to the virus. We identified 35,399 COVID-19 associated deaths during the 3-year pandemic in Slovakia compared to 21,395 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. The identification of COVID-19 associated deaths with our methodology offers a more accurate explanation for the notably high excess mortality observed in Slovakia (31,789 deaths) during the pandemic, relative to the EU27. Given the high level of excess mortality, the officially confirmed deaths are likely underestimated, and the presented methodology provides a more precise measure of mortality. Additionally, healthcare billing records prove valuable in identifying these deaths at the individual patient level using claims data of health insurance companies, which is crucial for implementing targeted preventive measures and improving preparedness for future pandemics.",

Since most infants in Norway are breastfed for the first 6 months of life, monitoring POP contamination in breastmilk is important for children's health and development. This study aims to evaluate the current levels of various POPs in women's breastmilk in Innlandet County, Norway. A cross\u2010sectional study was conducted measuring concentrations of 35 different POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlordanes (ChlDs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), Mirex, and brominated flame retardants in 120 breastmilk samples. The study analysed the impact of maternal age, parity, pre\u2010pregnancy BMI, and infant age on POPs levels and compared the estimated daily intake per body weight of infants to existing health guidelines. The detected percentages for PCBs were 100%, for DDTs 98.3%, and for ChlDs 98.3%. The highest median concentration was found for \u03a3PCBs (26.9\u2009ng/g lw).

We then predicted total and OOP costs defined by sample mode characteristics. This cohort included 74,324 patients. Cumulative total and OOP costs were significantly higher for radiation (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and for surgery (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) at Years 1, 3, and 5 compared to conservative management.

The study is designed systematically to identify the capacities of social institutions to empower the existing capacities and plan management and educational programs in a better manner to use these capacities within communities. This systematic review study is conducted until February 15, 2024. The PRISMA system was used to track the review process and findings. Databases were searched for relevant articles, and the STROBE checklist was used to evaluate the quality of the articles. The community-based social organizations will still face budgetary challenges and costs in their capacity-building efforts. As such, advanced management techniques such as teamwork, collaboration and coordination between departments, innovative thinking, brainstorming, or even the use of program evaluation and analytical actions can help reduce possible challenges. This calls for the availability of exact management models and planners in both government systems and people-centered systems to coordinate such capacities. This will seek to shed more light on the important role of social institutions and hence serve to give a clearer understanding of challenges, opportunities, and supportive actions for such institutions to contribute to better government system management.",

The Cytiva Nucleon PhytoPure and the Macherey-Nagel NucleoBond HMW DNA kits were selected because the former requires lower amounts of starting material and the latter utilizes gentler methods to maximize DNA length, albeit at a higher requirement for input material. The Cytiva Nucleon PhytoPure kit successfully recovered HMW DNA for half of our fungal species by increasing the amount of RNase A treatment and adding in a proteinase K treatment. To reduce the impact of pigmentation development, which occurs toward later stages of culturing, extractions were run in quadruplicate to increase overall DNA concentration. We also adapted the Macherey-Nagel NucleoBond HMW DNA kit for high-quality HMW DNA by grinding the sample to a fine powder, overnight lysis, and splitting the sample before washing the precipitated DNA. For both kits, precipitated DNA was spooled out pre-washing, ensuring a higher percentage of high-integrity long strands. The Macherey-Nagel protocol offers advantages over the first through the utilization of gravity columns that provide gentler treatment, yielding >50% of high-purity DNA strands exceeding 40 kbp. The limitation of this method is the requirement for a large quantity of starting material (1 g). By triaging samples based on the rate of growth relative to the accumulation of secondary metabolites, our methodologies hold promise for yielding reliable and high-quality HMW DNA from a variety of fungal samples, improving sequencing outcomes. \nKey features\n \u2022 Modified protocols for the extraction of high molecular weight fungal DNA suitable for long-read whole genome sequencing. \u2022 Approximately 4 h to complete four samples in parallel (excluding lysis time). \u2022 Optimized for the mycelium of Magnaporthaceae fungi, harvested before melanin (or secondary metabolite) buildup, but readily adaptable for other ascomycetes.",

This report aims to emphasize the importance of considering AMNs in the differential diagnosis of atypical pelvic symptoms, especially when initial evaluations suggest gynecological issues. A 56-year-old female with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia and a total vaginal hysterectomy performed over 20 years prior for abnormal uterine bleeding due to fibroids presented to her gynecologist with a three-week history of vaginal discharge and pelvic pain. Initial gynecological assessments were unremarkable, prompting a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which revealed a markedly dilated, fluid-filled appendix, indicative of a mucinous neoplasm. The patient underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, which confirmed a low-grade AMN with clear margins. Post-surgical follow-up showed no recurrence, and a surveillance colonoscopy one year later revealed a benign tubular adenoma. This case highlights the need to consider AMNs in the differential diagnosis of pelvic symptoms, particularly when initial gynecological evaluations do not identify a clear cause. AMNs can present with symptoms that overlap with those of gynecological conditions, making accurate diagnosis challenging. Effective management through early recognition and surgical intervention is important to prevent complications.

Recent studies have shown that shifts in the diapause stage precede social evolution in wasps and bees; however, the genomic basis remains unknown. Given the overlap in molecular pathways that regulate diapause and lifespan, we hypothesized that the evolutionary loss of developmental diapause may lead to extended lifespan among adults, which is a prerequisite for the evolution of eusociality. To test whether the loss of prepupal diapause is followed by genomic changes associated with lifespan extension, we compared 27 bee genomes with or without prepupal diapause. Our results point to several potential mechanisms for lifespan extension in species lacking prepupal diapause, including the loss of the growth hormone PTTH and its receptor TORSO, along with convergent selection in genes known to regulate lifespan in animals. Specifically, we observed purifying selection of prolongevity genes and relaxed selection of antilongevity genes within the IIS/TOR pathway in species that have lost prepupal diapause. Changes in selection pressures on this pathway may lead to the evolution of new phenotypes, such as lifespan extension and altered responses to nutritional signals that are crucial for social evolution.",

These lesions are poorly recognized, difficult to diagnose, and require specific arthroscopic exploration. Ramp lesions are typically associated with anterior cruciate ligament rupture and have important biomechanical consequences as they result in increased anterior tibial translation and external rotation. Suture hook repair through the posteromedial portal is safe and provides a high healing rate. Spontaneous healing of ramp lesions is rarely observed, and repair is indicated for all lesions with the involvement of meniscotibial ligament. The choice of a posteromedial repair technique with vertical suture performed under visual control allows restoration of the continuity of meniscotibial ligament and effective healing of these lesions. Standardized arthroscopic exploration with systematic visualization of the posteromedial compartment using the transnotch technique is a crucial point to diagnose these lesions. The use of transillumination and a needle allows to palpate the lesion with the tip of the needle in case of doubt (hidden lesion) before performing the posteromedial portal safely. By using the transnotch vision and by introducing the instruments through the posteromedial portal, debridement with the shaver and repair with the hook of the lesion are performed under visual control. Vertical repair is performed by taking care to pass the hook through the meniscotibial ligament by perforating the deep face of the capsular portion and anterior portion of the ramp lesion. Similarly, it is recommended not to catch too much meniscal tissue on the anterior margin side to remain in the red zone and not to perforate the meniscus in the avascular zone to avoid secondary lesions caused by the \u201ccheese wire\u201d effect of the sutures in the white zone. This technique has allowed us to reduce our percentage of secondary meniscectomy after ramp lesion repair from 25% using a standard arthroscopic exploration and meniscal repair technique through the anterior portal to 11.3% using a arthroscopic exploration and repair technique through the posteromedial portal at 4 years of follow-up. Systematic use of the transnotch vision and repair through the posteromedial portal are recommended for the management of these lesions, which demonstrate serious mechanical and clinical consequences.",

Some common issues when addressing these injuries surgically include the \u201cbungee-cord\u201d effect seen with implants that sit too far from the tibial plateau surface and loss of tension on the sutures after cycling of the knee after the repair. This video will discuss the presentation of a patient with a medial meniscal root repair treated with a novel technique to counteract these aforementioned issues. Based on the patient\u2019s medial meniscal root tear and minimal arthritis seen on radiograph, he was indicated for a meniscal root repair to prevent meniscal extrusion and reinforce normal meniscal hoop stresses to limit progression of his arthritis. This technique uses a novel re-tensionable all-suture anchor through a transtibial tunnel with 2 repair sutures through the meniscal root that sits just below the tibial plateau, allowing the surgeon the ability to re-tension the implant after cycling the knee. Arthroscopic repair of the medial meniscal root allowed the patient to return to his previous level of activity. In this case, arthroscopic medial meniscal root repair can yield good results in patients to get them back to their previous level of activity while minimizing the chance of rapid arthritic progression that is typically seen with nonoperative management of these injuries.

Risk factors include trochlear dysplasia, patella alta, abnormal patellar tilt, and increased tibial tubercle to trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance. A variety of surgical options are available for addressing patellar instability, and the selection of each technique should be tailored to the unique pathoanatomy of each patient. Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLR) is indicated for patients with patellar instability, and tibial tubercle osteotomy (TTO) is indicated for patients with a TT-TG >20 mm. An anterior midline incision is performed to expose the patella, patellar tendon, and tibial tubercle. Diagnostic arthroscopy is performed to assess patellar engagement and cartilage integrity, followed by the TTO. Three guidewires are placed with 15\u00b0 of obliquity, to guide a 6-cm osteotomy, from medial to lateral and from proximal to distal. A distal cortical hinge must be left intact. A 15-mm medial resection of the tibial tubercle is performed to avoid protrusion against the skin, which is followed by medialization of the tubercle and fixation with K-wires until dynamic testing ensures proper alignment and definitive fixation is achieved with cannulated headless screws. A lateral retinacular lengthening is performed to balance patellar forces. MPFLR is executed using a semitendinosus allograft. The graft is anchored to the patella and drawn through a surgically created plane to the medial femoral condyle. The femoral tunnel is created under fluoroscopy guidance, and the graft is then passed and secured. Graft tension and patellar mobility are adjusted according to dynamic testing. Once patellar stability is achieved and maintained through range of motion, the graft is then fixed. Patients can expect improved clinical outcomes with a high return-to-sports rate following both isolated MPFLR and concomitant TTO. The combination of MPFLR + TTO significantly reduces revision rate, compared to isolated MPFLR in patients with increased TT-TG distance, and enhances postoperative patellofemoral tracking. MPFLR + TTO improves patellofemoral tracking and corrects patellar instability, substantially improving postoperative outcomes compared to MPFLR alone. Patients with patellar instability and an increased TT-TG may be effectively treated with MPFLR + TTO.

              "content": "The electronic health record (EHR) has greatly expanded healthcare communication between patients and health workers. However, the volume and complexity of EHR messages have increased health workers' cognitive load, impeding effective care delivery and contributing to burnout. To understand these potential detriments resulting from EHR communication, we analyzed EHR messages sent between patients and health workers at Emory Healthcare, a large academic healthcare system in Atlanta, Georgia. We quantified the burden of messages interacted with by each health worker type and visualized the communication patterns using graph theory. Our analysis included 76,694 conversations comprising 144,369 messages sent between 47,460 patients and 3,749 health workers across 85 healthcare specialties. On average, nurses/certified nursing assistants/medical assistants (nurses/CNA/MA) interacted with the most messages (350), followed by non-physician practitioners (NPP) (241), physicians (166), and support staff (155), with the average conversation involving 10.51 interactions before resolution. Network analysis of the communication flow revealed that each health worker was connected to approximately two other health workers (average degree = 2.10). In message sending, support staff led in closeness centrality (0.44), followed by nurses/CNA/MA (0.41), highlighting their key role in fast information spread. For message reception, nurses/CNA/MA (0.51) and support staff (0.41) also had the highest values, underscoring their vital role in the communication network on the receiving end as well. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of applying graph theory to understand communication dynamics between patients and health workers and highlights the burden of EHR-based messaging.",

Earlier studies indicated that barriers to accessing information deter clinicians from seeking answers to clinical questions. To explore primary care clinicians' information\u2010seeking behaviour at point\u2010of\u2010care, focusing on when and how they seek answers to clinical questions. Semi\u2010structured interviews were conducted with 45 clinicians after clinical sessions to investigate their information\u2010seeking habits. Follow\u2010up interviews were conducted after a week for those intending to address unanswered queries. Two thirds of clinicians encountered questions during care, with nearly three quarters resolving them during the session. Colleagues, guidelines and online platforms were common information sources, with smartphones being used to access Google, WhatsApp or UpToDate\u00ae. Facilitators included reliable sources and the drive to confirm knowledge, while barriers included ineffective search methods and high workload. Despite challenges, most clinicians expressed satisfaction with their information\u2010seeking process. The findings underscore the increasing use of smartphones for accessing clinical information among Singaporean primary care clinicians and suggest the need for tailored training programmes and guidelines to optimise information\u2010seeking practices. Insights from this study can inform the development of training programmes and guidelines aimed at improving information\u2010seeking practices among primary care clinicians, potentially enhancing patient care quality.",

              "content": "Previous investigations have revealed performance deficits and altered neural processes during working-memory (WM) tasks in major depressive disorder (MDD). While most of these studies used task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there is an increasing interest in resting-state fMRI to characterize aberrant network dynamics involved in this and other MDD-associated symptoms. It has been proposed that activity during the resting-state represents characteristics of brain-wide functional organization, which could be highly relevant for the efficient execution of cognitive tasks. However, the dynamics linking resting-state properties and task-evoked activity remain poorly understood. Therefore, the present study investigated the association between spontaneous activity as indicated by the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) at rest and activity during an emotional n-back task. 60 patients diagnosed with an acute MDD episode, and 52 healthy controls underwent the fMRI scanning procedure. Within both groups, positive correlations between spontaneous activity at rest and task-activation were found in core regions of the central-executive network (CEN), whereas spontaneous activity correlated negatively with task-deactivation in regions of the default mode network (DMN). Compared to healthy controls, patients showed a decreased rest-task correlation in the left prefrontal cortex (CEN) and an increased negative correlation in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (DMN). Interestingly, no significant group-differences within those regions were found solely at rest or during the task. The results underpin the potential value and importance of resting-state markers for the understanding of dysfunctional network dynamics and neural substrates of cognitive processing.",

To optimise trial implementation, we investigated contextual fit with key local stakeholders. We used scenario\u2010based interviews with 17 health workers and four district managers to explore perceived feasibility. Eighteen policymakers were also surveyed to explore policy coherence, demand, acceptability, evidence needs, opportunities and risks. The Bowen feasibility framework and an access to health care framework were adapted and applied. Health workers perceived the MAMI Care Pathway as feasible to implement with support to access services and provide care. The approach is acceptable, given consistency with national policies, local protocols and potential to improve routine care quality. Demand for more comprehensive, preventive and person\u2010centred outpatient care was driven by concerns about unmet, hidden and costly care burden for health services and families. Inpatient care only for severe wasting treatment is inaccessible and unacceptable. Support for routine and expanded components, especially maternal mental health, is needed for successful implementation. Wider contextual factors may affect implementation fidelity and strength. Policymakers cautiously welcomed the approach, which resonates with national commitments, policies and plans but need evidence on how it can work within varied, complex contexts without further system overstretch. A responsive, pragmatic randomised controlled trial will generate the most useful evidence for policymakers. Findings have informed trial preparation and implementation, including a realist evaluation to contextualise outcomes.",
