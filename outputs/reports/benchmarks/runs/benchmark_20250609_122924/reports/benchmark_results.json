              "content": "The complex physical, cognitive, and psychological consequences of stroke can disrupt a survivor's sense of pre-stroke normality and identity. This can have a substantial impact on their individual and social lives. Individual reports about life after stroke have improved our understanding of this impact. However, stroke support systems, struggling with increased demands due to a growing stroke population and guideline requirements, require deeper insights based on synthesised narratives into what can enable stroke survivors to rebuild their lives and identities positively to provide person-centred care. A qualitative study using Charmaz's Constructivist Grounded Theory (GT) method. Semi-structured interviews lasting 60\u201390\u2005min were conducted. These interviews were held at least 12 months post-stroke. Thirty participants were interviewed from across the UK (14 women, 16 men; aged 31\u201386; 1\u201325 years post-stroke). Participants reported the disruption stroke could cause to their sense of identity. The concept of liminality, that describes the ambiguous, transformative state between two distinct stages, where an individual or group exists \u201cbetwixt and between\u201d stable conditions, explains the challenge to identity post-stroke. Participants reported developing an uncertain sense of identity as they struggled to structure identity in the same way they did before stroke. This is because the participants' characteristics, traits, hobbies, or future life plans, as well as social relationships and roles, were affected by stroke. Subsequently, participants began a process of reconfiguring their identity, an often-long-term process that involved coming to terms with, and integrating, the impact of stroke on their lives. As a result, participants could enter an indefinite period of sustained liminality as they contend with long-term change and continued uncertainty. The concept of liminality, which emerged from individual stroke narratives for the first time, conveyed the adaptive and enduring nature of a stroke survivor's journey. Post-stroke liminality may continue indefinitely, sustained by a survivor's subjective individual and social situation. This new insight justifies the urgent call for long-term rehabilitation and support that is tailored towards the unique nature of a survivor's circumstances. Further work is required to understand how tailored, long-term and person-centred support can encourage survivors to positively reconfigure their identity.",

However, current research on these aspects among adolescent golfers with different handicaps remains limited. This study aimed to examine anthropometric and strength characteristics in adolescent golfers of differing handicaps and to explore their relationship with golf performance (handicap). This cross-sectional study recruited 40 adolescent golfers (25 males, 15 females) via convenience sampling, divided into low (n\u2009=\u200920) and high (n\u2009=\u200920) handicap groups. Sample size was determined by a priori power analysis. Anthropometric measures (height, shoulder width, hip, thigh, calf circumferences) and standardized strength tests (grip strength, medicine ball throws, standing long jump, countermovement jump) were assessed. Group differences were analyzed via independent t-tests, and correlations between handicap and strength metrics were analyzed using Pearson\u2019s correlation (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Golfers with low handicaps demonstrated significantly greater shoulder width (p\u2009=\u20090.033), hip, thigh, and calf circumferences (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and performed better in all strength tests (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Pearson correlation analysis indicated significant negative correlations between handicap and multiple strength metrics (r ranging from -0.324 to -0.556, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that strength variables explained approximately 60% of handicap variance. No gender comparisons were conducted. Anthropometric advantages and higher strength/explosive power are associated with better performance (lower handicap) in adolescent golfers. It is recommended that training programs for adolescent golfers emphasize strength and explosive power development to improve competitive performance.",

              "content": "In severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), sedatives are often used to control intracranial pressure (ICP), to reduce brain metabolism, to allow for other treatments such as mechanical ventilation or targeted temperature management, or to control paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\u00a0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\u00a0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\u00a0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\u00a0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points. This study is the first prospective RCT to investigate the safety of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in TBI patients.

In our preliminary studies, we found that Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture could improve neurological deficits and neuropathological damage in the perihematomal area in ICH rats. The SIRT1/FOXO1 signaling pathway has been reported to mediate antioxidant and anti\u2010neuronal apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture on oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis after ICH and the role of SIRT1/FOXO1 in acupuncture's neuroprotection.

Neurological deficits were evaluated using the modified neurological severity score (mNSS). Brain edema was evaluated using brain water content. HE staining and Nissl staining were used to evaluate neuropathological damage in the perihematomal area. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling was used to quantify neuronal apoptosis. Specific kits were used to detect the levels of SOD, CAT, GSH\u2010Px in the brain. The oxidative DNA damage was evaluated using enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay to detect the level of 8\u2010hydroxyguanosine (8\u2010OHdG). Western blot was used to evaluate the expressions of SIRT1, Ac\u2010FOXO1, FOXO1, Bcl\u20102, and Bax. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted to detect the cellular localization of SIRT1. Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture improved the neurological deficits and brain edema, reduced the pathological injury and neuronal degeneration in 3 days in the perihematomal area after ICH. Mechanistically, acupuncture reduced oxidative stress injury and neuronal apoptosis via activating SIRT1/FOXO1 pathway. The neuroprotective effects of acupuncture were abolished by injection of the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527. Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture could reduce oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, at least in part, through the SIRT1/FOXO1 signaling pathway, improving neurological deficits and neuropathological damage after ICH. These findings suggest that Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture is an effective therapy for ICH, as well as targeting SIRT1 signaling to promote neuron survival could be a potential therapeutic strategy.",

A 61-year-old male was admitted due to recurrent low back pain accompanied by fever for 2 months. He had no history of invasive procedures or immunosuppressive therapy. The patient was diagnosed with FE. The patient underwent surgical treatment, during which the excrescence was removed, and mitral valve replacement was performed. Postoperatively, he received a full course of antifungal therapy. Postoperatively, the patient experienced relief from low back pain and was afebrile. He was discharged after completing antifungal treatment and, upon follow-up after 1 year, had no recurrence of low back pain. In this case, the patient initially presented with low back pain, which, despite the presence of fever and other signs of infection, did not readily suggest a cardiac etiology. This case highlights the importance of not being misled by superficial symptoms and underscores the need for comprehensive and accurate physical examinations and targeted investigations for proper diagnosis.",

Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is reported in 20% to 50% of PTC patients, mainly in the neck, and 20% originates from recurrence. LNM of papillary thyroid carcinoma are a plausible prognostic factor to determine disease recurrence. Currently, fine needle lymph node aspiration for cytology (LN\u2010FN\u2010cytology) is the best modality to diagnose LNM but is limited by diagnostic sensitivity and sample error. Fine needle lymph node aspiration for thyroglobulin measurement (LN\u2010FNA\u2010Tg) could offer a reliable and quantitative diagnostic method for LNM. The combination of LN\u2010FNA\u2010cytology and LN\u2010FNA\u2010Tg could achieve almost 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for LNM. Both treatment guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and European Thyroid Association recommend LN\u2010FNA\u2010Tg to diagnose LNM after total thyroidectomy. Diagnostic accuracy of the LN\u2010FNA\u2010Tg depends on optimal equipment, scanning protocol, skill, and experience of operators. Normal saline is mainly used for aspiration needle wash\u2010out and buffer solution. And radioimmunoassay or immunoradiometric assay are widely used for the LN\u2010FNA\u2010Tg measurement. So far, there is no consensus about the diagnostic threshold of LN\u2010FNA\u2010Tg for positive LNM, but high LN\u2010FNA\u2010Tg, especially higher than 10 ng/mL, strongly favors LNM.",

Pullbacks were randomly divided into a training and internal test set. An additional independent dataset was used for external testing. In total, 2808 frames were used for training and 218 for internal testing. The external test set comprised 392 frames. On the internal test set, the mean Dice score across nine classes was 0.659 overall and 0.757 on the true-positive frames, ranging from 0.281 to 0.989 per class. Substantial to almost perfect agreement was achieved for frame-wise identification of both lipid (\u03ba=0.817, 95% CI 0.743\u20130.891) and calcified plaques (\u03ba=0.795, 95% CI 0.703\u20130.887).

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

A hybrid power system containing a PV station that produces 1\u00a0MW and a wind farm from type Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) that produces 9\u00a0MW is connected to STATCOM with 48 pulses at PCC bus and energized load.

Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions. In this review, we highlight current findings on the role of ILCs and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma development and pathogenesis. We also examine the underlying mechanisms regulating their function and their interplay with other immune cells. Finally, we explore current therapies targeting these cells and their effector cytokines for asthma management.",

              "content": "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is a complex neurological phenomenon that is actually very common. AMI can appear following a knee injury or knee surgery. If it is not addressed, the patient's function can be negatively affected. There is currently no specific tool for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI. Following surgery or injury to the knee, AMI causes defective activation of the quadriceps, sometimes combined with a knee extension deficit. A clinical classification of AMI has been proposed recently to help with making the diagnosis and to guide treatment. In this article, we describe how biofeedback and surface electromyography (EMG) can be used in the early diagnosis and treatment of knee AMI. Biofeedback is based on transformation of physiological variables into a visual or auditory signal. This allows the patient to learn how to control physical and bodily functions, which were previously considered as involuntary processes. This technique requires the use of a specific device that transforms the measured physiological signals\u2014neuromuscular activation in this instance\u2014into visual signals. This tool incorporates surface EMG, with electrodes connected to a measuring unit. This unit is connected to a screen that shows the neuromuscular activation in real time. Thus, EMG biofeedback can be used to help clinicians make a diagnosis and to specifically treat the AMI. We have used biofeedback in patients who have a knee injury or who have undergone knee surgery. Both the therapist and patient were able to objectively see the presence of AMI using the biofeedback device. For treatment, the therapist works with a patient by providing clear instructions and increasingly more challenging goals. We show examples of how patients were able to eliminate their AMI by using biofeedback. EMG biofeedback is a promising tool for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear and ACL reconstruction surgery. The next steps are to define thresholds and a rehabilitation protocol that will be used in a clinical trial.

However, more targeted questionnaires reveal numerous debilitating symptoms for many years. To better quantify these persistent features, we designed the  L Ant E R n A participant\u2010driven mixed\u2010methods approach to develop a clinically valid questionnaire over three stages: (1) Item generation through semi\u2010structured interviews; (2) Repeated cognitive debriefing rounds to advance comprehensibility, relevance and comprehensiveness; (3) Psychometric survey to condense the most sensitive and valid questions.

              "content": "Altered protein homeostasis through proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins is a hallmark of many cancers. Ubiquitination, coordinated by E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, involves up to 40 E2-conjugating enzymes in humans to specify substrates and ubiquitin linkages. In a screen for E2 dependencies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 N (UBE2N) emerged as the top candidate. To investigate UBE2N\u2019s role in AML, we characterized an enzymatically defective mouse model of UBE2N, revealing UBE2N\u2019s requirement in AML without an impact on normal hematopoiesis. Unlike other E2s, which mediate lysine-48 (K48) polyubiquitination and degradation of proteins, UBE2N primarily synthesizes K63-linked chains, stabilizing or altering protein function. Proteomic analyses and a whole-genome CRISPR-activation screen in pharmacologically and genetically UBE2N-inhibited AML cells unveiled a network of UBE2N-regulated proteins, many of which are implicated in cancer. UBE2N inhibition reduced their protein levels, leading to increased K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation through the immunoproteasome and revealing UBE2N activity is enriched in immunoproteasome-positive AML. Furthermore, an interactome screen identified tripartite motif\u2013containing protein 21 (TRIM21) as the E3 ligase partnering with activated UBE2N in AML to modulate UBE2N-dependent proteostasis. In conclusion, UBE2N maintains proteostasis in AML by stabilizing target proteins through K63-linked ubiquitination and prevention of K48 ubiquitin\u2013mediated degradation by the immunoproteasome. Thus, inhibition of UBE2N catalytic function suppresses leukemic cells through selective degradation of critical proteins in immunoproteasome-positive AML.",

Recently, researchers have developed various carbon dot sensors for fast and real-time Glu monitoring. In this context, we provide a comprehensive introduction to Glu and CDs for the first time. We categorize the synthetic methods for CDs and the sensing mechanisms, further classifying the applications of carbon dot probes into single-probe sensing, ratiometric sensing, and visual detection. Finally, we discuss the future development needs for CD-based Glu sensors. This review aims to offer insights into advancing Glu sensors and modern medical treatments.",

Changes in cardiovascular/metabolic-related parameters, physical manifestations of hypercortisolism, and quality of life (QoL) were evaluated across the following patient subgroups: both LNSC and mUFC controlled, only mUFC controlled, only LNSC controlled, and neither controlled. Of 160 patients included in the analysis, 85.0% had both LNSC and mUFC uncontrolled at baseline.

The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

Here we show that the depletion of tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), causes synthetic dosage lethality (SDL) in MAD2-overexpressing cells, and we term this cell death MAD2-overexpressing interphase cell death (MOID). The induction of MOID depends on PML and DAXX mediating mitochondrial AIFM1-release. MAD2, TSG101, and AIF-PML-DAXX axis regulate mitochondria, PML nuclear bodies (NBs), and autophagy with close inter-dependent protein stability in survival cells. Loss of C-terminal phosphorylation(s) of TSG101 and closed (C-)MAD2-overexpression contribute to induce MOID. In survival cells, both MAD2 and TSG101 localize at PML NBs in interphase, and TSG101 Y390 phosphorylation is required for localization of TSG101 to PML NBs. PML release from PML NBs through PML deSUMOylation contributes to induce MOID.

              "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents a significant medical challenge due to its highly invasive nature, high rate of metastasis, and lack of drug-targetable receptors, which together lead to poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The traditional treatment guidelines for early TNBC are based on a multimodal approach integrating chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation and are associated with low overall survival and high relapse rates. Therefore, the approach to treating early TNBC has shifted towards neoadjuvant treatment (NAC), given to the patient before surgery and which aims to reduce tumour size, reduce the risk of recurrence, and improve the pathological complete response (pCR) rate. However, recent studies have shown that NAC is associated with only 30% of patients achieving pCR. Thus, novel predictive biomarkers are essential if treatment decisions are to be optimised and chemotherapy toxicities minimised. Given the heterogeneity of TNBC, mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies offer valuable tools for the discovery of targetable biomarkers for prognosis and prediction of toxicity. These biomarkers can serve as critical targets for therapeutic intervention. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of TNBC diagnosis and treatment, highlighting the need for a new approach. Specifically, it highlights how mass spectrometry-based can address key unmet clinical needs by identifying novel protein biomarkers to distinguish and early prognostication between TNBC patient groups who are being treated with NAC. By integrating proteomic insights, we anticipate enhanced treatment personalisation, improved clinical outcomes, and ultimately, increased survival rates for TNBC patients.",

For clinical evaluation, halitosis and HCB were evaluated pre-gargle (baseline), immediately after gargling (treatment), and 5 days after gargling (5 days post-treatment). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows. The level of subjective improvement was statistically significantly greater in the LCE group than the saline group (p < 0.05). Compared with the saline group, the LCE group showed reduced halitosis after 5 days of application. Furthermore, halitosis statistically significantly decreased over time (p < 0.05). Moreover, the LCE group showed a statistically significant decrease in the number of all six HCBs (p < 0.05). LCE gargle was effective in reducing halitosis both subjectively and objectively, suggesting an antibacterial effect on HCBs in the oral cavity. Thus, LCE, which can be used as a safe mouthwash ingredient, can promote oral health and will be valuable for the oral healthcare product industry.

It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.",

Clinical periodontal indices were recorded at baseline and at the 6-week follow-up post-treatment. ELISA was utilised to measure IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in gingival crevicular fluid. The subgingival microbiota\u2019s composition and variations were characterised using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, while quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to analyse the changes in the red-complex bacteria in subgingival plaque. The SRP+Nd group exhibited a statistically significant reduction in record probing depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP) compared to the SRP group after treatment (p<0.05). The SRP+Nd group showed a markedly lower IL-1\u03b2 level than the SRP group (p<0.05). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in the dominant subgingival microbiota composition and level of the red-complex bacteria between the two groups (p>0.05). The adjunctive use of Nd:YAG laser with SRP demonstrates promising short-term therapeutic benefits for patients with extensive stage III/grade C periodontitis. Both SRP as a standalone treatment and its combination with Nd:YAG laser effectively facilitate a transition in the dominant bacterial community from periodontitis-associated to periodontal health-associated microbiota.",

Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.",

Changes in cardiovascular/metabolic-related parameters, physical manifestations of hypercortisolism, and quality of life (QoL) were evaluated across the following patient subgroups: both LNSC and mUFC controlled, only mUFC controlled, only LNSC controlled, and neither controlled. Of 160 patients included in the analysis, 85.0% had both LNSC and mUFC uncontrolled at baseline. At week 72, 48.6% of patients had both LNSC and mUFC controlled; these patients generally exhibited greater improvements in cardiovascular/metabolic-related parameters than those with only mUFC controlled or both LNSC and mUFC uncontrolled: systolic/diastolic blood pressure, \u22127.4%/\u22124.9%, \u22126.0%/\u22125.5%, and 2.3%/0.8%, respectively; fasting plasma glucose, \u22125.0%, \u22124.8%, and 1.9%; glycated hemoglobin, \u22125.1%, \u22124.8%, and \u22121.3%.

This can have a substantial impact on their individual and social lives. Individual reports about life after stroke have improved our understanding of this impact. However, stroke support systems, struggling with increased demands due to a growing stroke population and guideline requirements, require deeper insights based on synthesised narratives into what can enable stroke survivors to rebuild their lives and identities positively to provide person-centred care. A qualitative study using Charmaz's Constructivist Grounded Theory (GT) method. Semi-structured interviews lasting 60\u201390\u2005min were conducted. These interviews were held at least 12 months post-stroke. Thirty participants were interviewed from across the UK (14 women, 16 men; aged 31\u201386; 1\u201325 years post-stroke). Participants reported the disruption stroke could cause to their sense of identity. The concept of liminality, that describes the ambiguous, transformative state between two distinct stages, where an individual or group exists \u201cbetwixt and between\u201d stable conditions, explains the challenge to identity post-stroke. Participants reported developing an uncertain sense of identity as they struggled to structure identity in the same way they did before stroke. This is because the participants' characteristics, traits, hobbies, or future life plans, as well as social relationships and roles, were affected by stroke. Subsequently, participants began a process of reconfiguring their identity, an often-long-term process that involved coming to terms with, and integrating, the impact of stroke on their lives. As a result, participants could enter an indefinite period of sustained liminality as they contend with long-term change and continued uncertainty. The concept of liminality, which emerged from individual stroke narratives for the first time, conveyed the adaptive and enduring nature of a stroke survivor's journey. Post-stroke liminality may continue indefinitely, sustained by a survivor's subjective individual and social situation. This new insight justifies the urgent call for long-term rehabilitation and support that is tailored towards the unique nature of a survivor's circumstances. Further work is required to understand how tailored, long-term and person-centred support can encourage survivors to positively reconfigure their identity.",

This cross-sectional study recruited 40 adolescent golfers (25 males, 15 females) via convenience sampling, divided into low (n\u2009=\u200920) and high (n\u2009=\u200920) handicap groups. Sample size was determined by a priori power analysis. Anthropometric measures (height, shoulder width, hip, thigh, calf circumferences) and standardized strength tests (grip strength, medicine ball throws, standing long jump, countermovement jump) were assessed. Group differences were analyzed via independent t-tests, and correlations between handicap and strength metrics were analyzed using Pearson\u2019s correlation (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Golfers with low handicaps demonstrated significantly greater shoulder width (p\u2009=\u20090.033), hip, thigh, and calf circumferences (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and performed better in all strength tests (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Pearson correlation analysis indicated significant negative correlations between handicap and multiple strength metrics (r ranging from -0.324 to -0.556, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that strength variables explained approximately 60% of handicap variance. No gender comparisons were conducted. Anthropometric advantages and higher strength/explosive power are associated with better performance (lower handicap) in adolescent golfers. It is recommended that training programs for adolescent golfers emphasize strength and explosive power development to improve competitive performance.",

In the perspective of an international survey to analyze our practice regarding biceps management in small rotator cuff tears, the aim is to collect all the possible LHB abnormalities according to literature review, before considering that the LHB could be normal or pathologic. The SFA (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Francophone d\u2019Arthroscopie) behind its research biceps group summarized these abnormalities in a description analysis called the \u201cbiceps box\u201d concept, which was validated with a strong inter-rater reliability. The aim is to present the description analysis using a common language with short video records for each abnormality described to reproduce \u201cintraoperatively\u201d the different possible scenarios the surgeon has to encounter during arthroscopic evaluation. The description of the \u201cbiceps box\u201d concept classifies lesions of the LHB, with so-called intrinsic lesions, for which the LHB should be considered pathological: partial rupture or delamination, fissuring, lateral or medial instability or subluxation, hypertrophy with an hourglass figure; and so-called extrinsic lesions, for which the LHB should be considered healthy: damage to the pulley without bicipital instability, exposure of the articular portion of the biceps by rupture of the supraspinatus tendon, inflammation of the superficial surface of the tendon, presence of type 1 or 2 superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions, or a chondral print. We present the 10 possible scenarios with video records according to our description analysis. The LHB could be considered as a pain generator in certain situations which are still not completely clear. The indication of biceps tenotomy or tenodesis depends on the interpretation of the surgeon of these abnormalities as a pathologic or a normal condition.

This study investigates whether real-life 360-degree VR can enhance medical students' interest in neurosurgery and serve as an effective educational tool. Methods:\u00a0A VR-based educational program was developed using 360-degree video footage captured with Insta360 Pro cameras installed in the emergency department, operating room, and angiography suite. The content was incorporated into a neurosurgical clinical training course for 85 fifth-year medical students at the International University of Health and Welfare Narita Hospital in Narita, Japan. Students viewed the VR content through synchronized head-mounted displays. After the session, an anonymous questionnaire assessed usability, immersion, comprehension, enjoyment, and interest in neurosurgery. A paired samples t-test was used to compare students' interest in neurosurgery before and after the session. Results:\u00a0High levels of satisfaction were reported with regard to usability (95%) and immersion (97.6%). Most students agreed that the VR session improved their understanding (92.9%) and was enjoyable (95%). Interest in neurosurgery increased significantly following the session, with affirmative responses rising from 22 (26%) to 52 (61%) students (t=6.77; df=84; p<0.0001).

            "The complex physical, cognitive, and psychological consequences of stroke can disrupt a survivor's sense of pre-stroke normality and identity. This can have a substantial impact on their individual and social lives. Individual reports about life after stroke have improved our understanding of this impact. However, stroke support systems, struggling with increased demands due to a growing stroke population and guideline requirements, require deeper insights based on synthesised narratives into what can enable stroke survivors to rebuild their lives and identities positively to provide person-centred care. A qualitative study using Charmaz's Constructivist Grounded Theory (GT) method. Semi-structured interviews lasting 60\u201390\u2005min were conducted. These interviews were held at least 12 months post-stroke. Thirty participants were interviewed from across the UK (14 women, 16 men; aged 31\u201386; 1\u201325 years post-stroke). Participants reported the disruption stroke could cause to their sense of identity. The concept of liminality, that describes the ambiguous, transformative state between two distinct stages, where an individual or group exists \u201cbetwixt and between\u201d stable conditions, explains the challenge to identity post-stroke. Participants reported developing an uncertain sense of identity as they struggled to structure identity in the same way they did before stroke. This is because the participants' characteristics, traits, hobbies, or future life plans, as well as social relationships and roles, were affected by stroke. Subsequently, participants began a process of reconfiguring their identity, an often-long-term process that involved coming to terms with, and integrating, the impact of stroke on their lives. As a result, participants could enter an indefinite period of sustained liminality as they contend with long-term change and continued uncertainty. The concept of liminality, which emerged from individual stroke narratives for the first time, conveyed the adaptive and enduring nature of a stroke survivor's journey. Post-stroke liminality may continue indefinitely, sustained by a survivor's subjective individual and social situation. This new insight justifies the urgent call for long-term rehabilitation and support that is tailored towards the unique nature of a survivor's circumstances. Further work is required to understand how tailored, long-term and person-centred support can encourage survivors to positively reconfigure their identity.",
            "The athletic performance of adolescent golfers is influenced by various factors, among which strength qualities and anthropometric characteristics are key. However, current research on these aspects among adolescent golfers with different handicaps remains limited. This study aimed to examine anthropometric and strength characteristics in adolescent golfers of differing handicaps and to explore their relationship with golf performance (handicap). This cross-sectional study recruited 40 adolescent golfers (25 males, 15 females) via convenience sampling, divided into low (n\u2009=\u200920) and high (n\u2009=\u200920) handicap groups. Sample size was determined by a priori power analysis. Anthropometric measures (height, shoulder width, hip, thigh, calf circumferences) and standardized strength tests (grip strength, medicine ball throws, standing long jump, countermovement jump) were assessed. Group differences were analyzed via independent t-tests, and correlations between handicap and strength metrics were analyzed using Pearson\u2019s correlation (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Golfers with low handicaps demonstrated significantly greater shoulder width (p\u2009=\u20090.033), hip, thigh, and calf circumferences (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and performed better in all strength tests (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Pearson correlation analysis indicated significant negative correlations between handicap and multiple strength metrics (r ranging from -0.324 to -0.556, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that strength variables explained approximately 60% of handicap variance. No gender comparisons were conducted. Anthropometric advantages and higher strength/explosive power are associated with better performance (lower handicap) in adolescent golfers. It is recommended that training programs for adolescent golfers emphasize strength and explosive power development to improve competitive performance.",

            "Considering the long head of biceps (LHB) management, important cultural differences exist among the surgeons around the world, especially when repairing small isolated distal supraspinatus tears under arthroscopy. In the perspective of an international survey to analyze our practice regarding biceps management in small rotator cuff tears, the aim is to collect all the possible LHB abnormalities according to literature review, before considering that the LHB could be normal or pathologic. The SFA (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Francophone d\u2019Arthroscopie) behind its research biceps group summarized these abnormalities in a description analysis called the \u201cbiceps box\u201d concept, which was validated with a strong inter-rater reliability. The aim is to present the description analysis using a common language with short video records for each abnormality described to reproduce \u201cintraoperatively\u201d the different possible scenarios the surgeon has to encounter during arthroscopic evaluation. The description of the \u201cbiceps box\u201d concept classifies lesions of the LHB, with so-called intrinsic lesions, for which the LHB should be considered pathological: partial rupture or delamination, fissuring, lateral or medial instability or subluxation, hypertrophy with an hourglass figure; and so-called extrinsic lesions, for which the LHB should be considered healthy: damage to the pulley without bicipital instability, exposure of the articular portion of the biceps by rupture of the supraspinatus tendon, inflammation of the superficial surface of the tendon, presence of type 1 or 2 superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions, or a chondral print. We present the 10 possible scenarios with video records according to our description analysis. The LHB could be considered as a pain generator in certain situations which are still not completely clear. The indication of biceps tenotomy or tenodesis depends on the interpretation of the surgeon of these abnormalities as a pathologic or a normal condition. The next step is to use these videos in an international survey to assess cultural differences regarding the management and eventually find a consensus regarding treatment options for each abnormality.

            "Stroke ranks as the second leading cause of mortality and the third leading cause of disability globally. Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is a prevalent complication following acute ischemic stroke, imposing substantial burdens on patients, families, and society. This study aimed to explore the potential of circulating immune-inflammatory markers as predictors of PSCI. Conducted as a prospective observational cohort study from June 2023 to August 2024 at the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, it included patients experiencing their first acute ischemic stroke within 72 h of symptom onset.

            "This conceptual analysis focuses on opportunities to advance research and current hypotheses of perceptual development by examining what is presently known and unknown about perceptual specialization in a Multiracial context during the first year of life. The impact of being raised in a Multiracial family or community is discussed to further characterize the development of perceptual expertise for faces and languages. Historical and present-day challenges faced by researchers in defining what race is, identifying Multiracial individuals or contexts, and how to study perceptual and cognitive processes in this population are discussed. We propose to leverage current data from developmental Multilingual populations as a guide for future research questions and hypotheses characterizing perceptual specialization based on face race for Multiracial/Multiethnic individuals and contexts. Variability of input and the pattern of specialization are two factors identified from the developmental Multilingual literature that are likely useful for studying Multiracial contexts and development. Several methodological considerations are proposed in hopes of facilitating research questions and practices that are reflective of and informed by the diversity of experiences and social complexities within Multiracial populations.",
            "Background: Traditional surgical education faces challenges such as limited visibility, physical space constraints, and restricted access for students. Virtual reality (VR) technology offers a promising alternative, especially with real-life 360-degree video, which can recreate immersive clinical experiences. This study investigates whether real-life 360-degree VR can enhance medical students' interest in neurosurgery and serve as an effective educational tool. Methods:\u00a0A VR-based educational program was developed using 360-degree video footage captured with Insta360 Pro cameras installed in the emergency department, operating room, and angiography suite. The content was incorporated into a neurosurgical clinical training course for 85 fifth-year medical students at the International University of Health and Welfare Narita Hospital in Narita, Japan. Students viewed the VR content through synchronized head-mounted displays. After the session, an anonymous questionnaire assessed usability, immersion, comprehension, enjoyment, and interest in neurosurgery. A paired samples t-test was used to compare students' interest in neurosurgery before and after the session. Results:\u00a0High levels of satisfaction were reported with regard to usability (95%) and immersion (97.6%). Most students agreed that the VR session improved their understanding (92.9%) and was enjoyable (95%). Interest in neurosurgery increased significantly following the session, with affirmative responses rising from 22 (26%) to 52 (61%) students (t=6.77; df=84; p<0.0001). Conclusion: Real-life 360-degree VR is an effective supplementary tool for neurosurgical education. It offers immersive experiences that can enhance student engagement, understanding, and interest in neurosurgery. Broader implementation of this technology may address declining interest in the specialty and enrich clinical education.",
            "At present, the conventional methods for diagnosing cerebral edema in clinical practice are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can evaluate the location and degree of peripheral cerebral edema, but cannot realize quantification. When patients have symptoms of diffuse cerebral edema or high cranial pressure, CT or MRI often suggests that cerebral edema is lagging and cannot be dynamically monitored in real time. Intracranial pressure monitoring is the gold standard, but it is an invasive operation with high cost and complications. For clinical purposes, the ideal cerebral edema monitoring should be non-invasive, real-time, bedside, and continuous dynamic monitoring. The disturbance coefficient (DC) was used in this study to dynamically monitor the occurrence, development, and evolution of cerebral edema in patients with cerebral hemorrhage in real time, and review head CT or MRI to evaluate the development of the disease and guide further treatment, so as to improve the prognosis of patients with cerebral hemorrhage.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and water contact angle measurements were used to validate the influence of nanoparticles on the composite membrane (PVDF/Ag-ZnO) structure. Conversely, morphology (porosity, surface rigorosity), hydrophilicity, and permeability were analyzed through contact angle, image analysis, and flux measurement. In addition, the membranes were tested for antimicrobial activity against  E. coli w w",

In this study, starting from a core@shell Au nanotriangle (AuNT)@Pd nanostructure, the formation of a phase\u2010separated bi\u2010metallic Au\u2500Pd NP system at high temperature is reported, despite the fact that Au and Pd are miscible in the entire composition and temperature range. In situ TEM heating of bare AuNT@Pd core@shell structures up to 1000\u00a0\u00b0C is performed. Between 400 and 800\u00a0\u00b0C, an initial alloy formation is observed. Notably, higher initial loading of Pd increases the melting temperature of the bi\u2010metallic system. However, the most important observation is the separation of the nanostructure into Au and Pd phases at temperatures above 850 \u00b0C for high Pd doping. The extent of Pd separation depends on the amount of initial Pd loading. A Janus Au\u2500Pd nanostructure is formed at the end of the thermal treatments at 1000\u00a0\u00b0C.

Different roles of MYB TFs have been suggested such as regulation of cellular growth and differentiation, hormonal signaling, mediating abiotic stress responses, etc. To gain significant insights, a comprehensive in-silico analysis of OsMYB TF was carried out in comparison with 21 dicot MYB TFs and 10 monocot MYB TFs.

The phylogenetic relationship was also studied, which resulted in the classification of proteins into four basic groups: groups A, B, C, and D. The protein motif analysis identified several conserved sequences responsible for cellular activities. The gene structure analysis suggested that proteins that were present in the same class, showed similar intron-exon structures.

Machine learning has proven to be an important tool in this context. Numerous studies have investigated its potential for predicting yields under different conditions. Among these algorithms, Random Forest (RF) has gained prominence due to its ability to manage large data sets with high dimensions, as well as its ability to uncover complicated non-linear relationships and interactions between variables. RF is particularly suitable for scenarios with categorical variables and missing data. Given the complex web of management practices and their nonlinear effects on yield prediction, it is important to investigate new machine learning algorithms.

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling was used to quantify neuronal apoptosis. Specific kits were used to detect the levels of SOD, CAT, GSH\u2010Px in the brain. The oxidative DNA damage was evaluated using enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay to detect the level of 8\u2010hydroxyguanosine (8\u2010OHdG). Western blot was used to evaluate the expressions of SIRT1, Ac\u2010FOXO1, FOXO1, Bcl\u20102, and Bax. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted to detect the cellular localization of SIRT1. Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture improved the neurological deficits and brain edema, reduced the pathological injury and neuronal degeneration in 3 days in the perihematomal area after ICH. Mechanistically, acupuncture reduced oxidative stress injury and neuronal apoptosis via activating SIRT1/FOXO1 pathway.

The goal of this research was to compare the anorectic responses to these five mycotoxins and relate these effects to proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-18 (IL-18) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) following intraperitoneal (IP) and oral exposure to a common dose at 2.5\u202fmg/kg BW in mice. Plasma IL-18 and IL-6 were elevated within 1\u20132\u202fh and returned to basal levels at 6\u202fh after exposure to DON, 3-ADON and 15-ADON. FX promoted IL-18 expression at 6\u202fh. Whereas, FX only promoted IL-6 at 6\u202fh. When NIV was injected intraperitoneally, IL-18 started to rise at 1\u202fh and peaked at 6\u202fh. Whereas, NIV only promoted IL-18 at 2\u202fh following oral exposure. IP exposure to NIV induced an increase in IL-6 that occurred only at 2\u202fh. No effect on IL-6 when exposed orally to NIV. In conclusion, the data indicate that IL-18 and IL-6 play critical roles in anorectic response induced by DON and its four congeners 3-ADON, 15-ADON, NIV, FX.",

To enhance crop productivity, molecular approaches have been used to determine the key regulators affecting stress-related phenomena. MYB transcription factors (TF) have been reported as one of the promising defensive proteins against the unfavorable conditions that plants must face. Different roles of MYB TFs have been suggested such as regulation of cellular growth and differentiation, hormonal signaling, mediating abiotic stress responses, etc. To gain significant insights, a comprehensive in-silico analysis of OsMYB TF was carried out in comparison with 21 dicot MYB TFs and 10 monocot MYB TFs. Their chromosomal location, gene structure, protein domain, and motifs were analyzed. The phylogenetic relationship was also studied, which resulted in the classification of proteins into four basic groups: groups A, B, C, and D. The protein motif analysis identified several conserved sequences responsible for cellular activities. The gene structure analysis suggested that proteins that were present in the same class, showed similar intron-exon structures.

            "Understanding accurate methods for predicting yields in complex agricultural systems is critical for effective nutrient management and crop growth. Machine learning has proven to be an important tool in this context. Numerous studies have investigated its potential for predicting yields under different conditions. Among these algorithms, Random Forest (RF) has gained prominence due to its ability to manage large data sets with high dimensions, as well as its ability to uncover complicated non-linear relationships and interactions between variables. RF is particularly suitable for scenarios with categorical variables and missing data. Given the complex web of management practices and their nonlinear effects on yield prediction, it is important to investigate new machine learning algorithms. In this context, our study focused on the evaluation of gradient boosting methods, particularly Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), as potential candidates for yield estimation of the maize hybrid Zhengdan 958. Our aim was not only to evaluate and compare these algorithms with existing approaches, but also to comprehensively analyze the resulting model uncertainties. Our approach includes comparing multiple machine learning algorithms, developing and selecting suitable features, fine-tuning the models by training and adjusting the hyperparameters, and visualizing the results.

            "Pastoralists and national parks are key stakeholders in the management and conservation of natural and protected habitats. In Ethiopia, Afar pastoralists migrate seasonally with their livestock in search for grazing and water areas. Livestock are also a source of infectious diseases that can spread into wildlife populations when pastoralists encroach into unfenced national parks. The interactions between pastoralists and national parks, as well as the subsequent impacts, remain insufficiently understood in Afar. Two structured questionnaire surveys were conducted in 2021, including 300 pastoralist households in seven woredas of Afar, and 58 staff from three national parks (Awash, Alidegi and Yangudi Rassa). They captured pastoralist movements and livestock diseases as well as the perception of national park staff regarding challenges resulting from pastoral encroachment into parks. Among the pastoralists, 74.7% migrated with their livestock for a mean 3.5\u00a0months per year, during which time, 90% of respondents reported contact with other livestock herds, and over 80% with wildlife. A third (34.2%) reported disease outbreaks in their village prior to migration. Pastoralists traveled long distances, crossing woreda, regional or national boundaries. All 58-park respondents reported pastoralists with livestock inside their park and their close contact with wildlife. Additionally, 69% reported the presence of domestic dogs. Wildlife displacement, habitat loss and dog attacks on wildlife were perceived as the main threat caused by the presence of pastoralists, whereas diseases were only mentioned by 15.5%.

The SIRT1/FOXO1 signaling pathway has been reported to mediate antioxidant and anti\u2010neuronal apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture on oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis after ICH and the role of SIRT1/FOXO1 in acupuncture's neuroprotection. ICH rat models were established by autologous tail blood (50 \u00b5L) infusion into the caudate nucleus.

Neurological deficits were evaluated using the modified neurological severity score (mNSS). Brain edema was evaluated using brain water content. HE staining and Nissl staining were used to evaluate neuropathological damage in the perihematomal area. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling was used to quantify neuronal apoptosis. Specific kits were used to detect the levels of SOD, CAT, GSH\u2010Px in the brain. The oxidative DNA damage was evaluated using enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay to detect the level of 8\u2010hydroxyguanosine (8\u2010OHdG). Western blot was used to evaluate the expressions of SIRT1, Ac\u2010FOXO1, FOXO1, Bcl\u20102, and Bax. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted to detect the cellular localization of SIRT1. Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture improved the neurological deficits and brain edema, reduced the pathological injury and neuronal degeneration in 3 days in the perihematomal area after ICH. Mechanistically, acupuncture reduced oxidative stress injury and neuronal apoptosis via activating SIRT1/FOXO1 pathway. The neuroprotective effects of acupuncture were abolished by injection of the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527. Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture could reduce oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, at least in part, through the SIRT1/FOXO1 signaling pathway, improving neurological deficits and neuropathological damage after ICH. These findings suggest that Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture is an effective therapy for ICH, as well as targeting SIRT1 signaling to promote neuron survival could be a potential therapeutic strategy.",

It highlights the importance of timely elective hernia management in lowering emergency presentations and any related complications. Background Abdominal wall hernias are common surgical conditions that can present electively or as emergencies, with emergency cases being associated with higher complication rates. In recent years, there has been an increase in emergency hernia presentations, leading to a greater number of urgent surgeries. These emergency operations have been linked to higher rates of post-op complications and re-interventions due to factors like bowel obstruction, strangulation, and delayed intervention. Therefore, research and analysis of post-op outcomes are essential to highlight the potential role of elective hernia management in reducing the burden of emergency cases. Methods This study was a single-institution retrospective study that looked at patient data over a 10-year period and involved patients who presented with abdominal wall hernias on an emergency basis and underwent surgical repair. Data were collected on patient demographics, presenting symptoms, hernia type, surgical technique, use of mesh reinforcement, post-op complications, re-intervention rates, and length of hospital stay. The database was developed and analysed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and the results were considered significant at p<0.005. Results Over a 10-year period, 239 patients presented with emergency abdominal wall hernias, with 238 undergoing surgical repair; one patient died before surgery. Most repairs were performed using an open approach (93%, n=221), while 7% (n=17) were laparoscopic. Primary repair was conducted in 47% of cases (n=111), and mesh reinforcement was used in 53% (n=127). The overall recurrence rate was low (2%, n=4), with higher recurrence observed only in primary repairs. Mesh repairs had a higher incidence of post-op complications (56%, n=37) compared to primary repairs (44%, n=29). Patients who underwent mesh repair had an average hospital stay of eight days compared to those with primary repair (nine days). Inguinal, umbilical, and femoral hernias were the most common types observed, accounting for over 76% of cases. In total, 6% of patients (n=15) required bowel resections, highlighting the complexity of these cases. Most patients (72%, n=172) experienced no complications, but some of the most common post-op complications were wound dehiscence (7%, n=17), post-op collection (7%, n=16), delayed recovery (3%, n=8), and recurrence (2%, n=4). Conclusion It has been observed that a greater number of post-op complications and longer hospital stays are linked to emergency hernia procedures, especially when mesh repair is utilised. Although the recurrence rate of mesh repairs is lower than that of primary repair, the increased risk of complications highlights the significance of cautious surgical planning and patient selection. In conclusion, this study highlights the benefits of elective hernia management in reducing emergency presentations and the unfavourable consequences that may arise from it. These results support the importance of pre-op optimisation, especially for high-risk patients, and add to the debate on the best surgical techniques.",

Previous research reports that strabismic adults with a psychosocial influence of the condition may benefit from preoperative psychosocial support, although what such support should consist of is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to describe strabismic adults' expectations of psychosocial support from healthcare professionals. The study has a qualitative descriptive design. It included 12 semi\u2010structured interviews with purposefully recruited patients who had experienced the psychosocial influences of strabismus. The data were analyzed by inductive content analysis. Strabismic adult patients described their expectations for psychosocial support, consisting of education about strabismus, genuine encounters with strabismus experts, accessible support, and available peer support. The participants explained that strabismus specialists should provide tailored education for patients, the public, and other healthcare professionals. They shared that strabismus professionals should ask about patients' psychosocial well\u2010being\u2014that by intently listening, openly discussing, and validating patients' experiences, they could support their well\u2010being.

            "A new type of position-sensitive detectors is gaining attention in the neutron community. They are scintillator based detectors that detect the scintillation light on an individual photon basis via an image intensifier and a fast image sensor. Their readout operates in event mode i.e. it produces information about individual neutron interactions, reconstructed from the sensor data, thus enabling to achieve superior spatial and temporal resolutions compared to regular detectors. Although the development of current detectors is focused on neutrons, the concept is also applicable to the detection of other particles such as high-energy photons. This document provides a description on how these detectors are built, how they operate, and what their characteristics are. An example of a detector implementation based on a Timepix3 chip is described to illustrate the detector concept. This includes a detailed description of the algorithm that reconstructs the neutron interactions from the sensor data, one of the core components that sets it apart from established scintillator-based imaging detectors. Energy-resolved epithermal neutron radiography was performed at the ISIS EMMA beamline with this detector, illustrating some of the fundamental differences in the data that can be produced with the new type of detector compared to more established types of scintillator based neutron detectors. The term LumaCam is proposed to refer to this new class of position-sensitive event-mode detectors.",
            "Aims This study aims to analyse the type of repair and post-op outcomes for individuals who underwent surgical intervention and presented with symptomatic abdominal wall hernia as an emergency. It highlights the importance of timely elective hernia management in lowering emergency presentations and any related complications. Background Abdominal wall hernias are common surgical conditions that can present electively or as emergencies, with emergency cases being associated with higher complication rates. In recent years, there has been an increase in emergency hernia presentations, leading to a greater number of urgent surgeries. These emergency operations have been linked to higher rates of post-op complications and re-interventions due to factors like bowel obstruction, strangulation, and delayed intervention. Therefore, research and analysis of post-op outcomes are essential to highlight the potential role of elective hernia management in reducing the burden of emergency cases. Methods This study was a single-institution retrospective study that looked at patient data over a 10-year period and involved patients who presented with abdominal wall hernias on an emergency basis and underwent surgical repair. Data were collected on patient demographics, presenting symptoms, hernia type, surgical technique, use of mesh reinforcement, post-op complications, re-intervention rates, and length of hospital stay. The database was developed and analysed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and the results were considered significant at p<0.005. Results Over a 10-year period, 239 patients presented with emergency abdominal wall hernias, with 238 undergoing surgical repair; one patient died before surgery.

Patients who underwent mesh repair had an average hospital stay of eight days compared to those with primary repair (nine days). Inguinal, umbilical, and femoral hernias were the most common types observed, accounting for over 76% of cases. In total, 6% of patients (n=15) required bowel resections, highlighting the complexity of these cases. Most patients (72%, n=172) experienced no complications, but some of the most common post-op complications were wound dehiscence (7%, n=17), post-op collection (7%, n=16), delayed recovery (3%, n=8), and recurrence (2%, n=4).

              "content": "In severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), sedatives are often used to control intracranial pressure (ICP), to reduce brain metabolism, to allow for other treatments such as mechanical ventilation or targeted temperature management, or to control paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\u00a0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\u00a0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\u00a0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\u00a0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points. This study is the first prospective RCT to investigate the safety of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in TBI patients.

Oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis play essential roles in ICH, determining neuronal survival. In our preliminary studies, we found that Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture could improve neurological deficits and neuropathological damage in the perihematomal area in ICH rats. The SIRT1/FOXO1 signaling pathway has been reported to mediate antioxidant and anti\u2010neuronal apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture on oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis after ICH and the role of SIRT1/FOXO1 in acupuncture's neuroprotection. ICH rat models were established by autologous tail blood (50 \u00b5L) infusion into the caudate nucleus. EX527, SIRT1\u2010specific inhibitor\u00a0was\u00a0intraperitoneally\u00a0administered 3 days before ICH.\u00a0Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin\u00a0acupuncture treatment was performed once a day for 30 min after ICH. Neurological deficits were evaluated using the modified neurological severity score (mNSS). Brain edema was evaluated using brain water content. HE staining and Nissl staining were used to evaluate neuropathological damage in the perihematomal area. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling was used to quantify neuronal apoptosis. Specific kits were used to detect the levels of SOD, CAT, GSH\u2010Px in the brain. The oxidative DNA damage was evaluated using enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay to detect the level of 8\u2010hydroxyguanosine (8\u2010OHdG). Western blot was used to evaluate the expressions of SIRT1, Ac\u2010FOXO1, FOXO1, Bcl\u20102, and Bax. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted to detect the cellular localization of SIRT1. Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture improved the neurological deficits and brain edema, reduced the pathological injury and neuronal degeneration in 3 days in the perihematomal area after ICH. Mechanistically, acupuncture reduced oxidative stress injury and neuronal apoptosis via activating SIRT1/FOXO1 pathway. The neuroprotective effects of acupuncture were abolished by injection of the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527. Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture could reduce oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, at least in part, through the SIRT1/FOXO1 signaling pathway, improving neurological deficits and neuropathological damage after ICH. These findings suggest that Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture is an effective therapy for ICH, as well as targeting SIRT1 signaling to promote neuron survival could be a potential therapeutic strategy.",

However, recent research has suggested that vital pulp therapy (VPT) may be a less invasive option in these cases. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the outcomes of VPT, using hydraulic calcium silicate cements (HCSCs) including complete and partial pulpotomies in permanent posterior teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. The PRISMA recommendations were adhered to. The search approach used electronic databases from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and grey literature. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, ROBINS-I, and Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tools were used to evaluate the quality of the selected studies. The initial database search turned up 142 papers, of which 3 prospective cohort studies and 9 randomised controlled trials were selected for analysis. For three, seven, and two articles, the risk of bias was rated as \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cserious,\u201d \u201cfair,\u201d and \u201clow,\u201d respectively.

Although the intra-operative pulp assessment is essential for VPT treatments, most studies did not provide a thorough account of this process or the time required to achieve haemostasis. Three studies reported sample sizes that were < 23 teeth. The 12 studies that were analysed revealed successful VPT procedures using HCSCs in permanent posterior teeth that had symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, with radiographic success rates ranging from 81% to 90%.

Integer-arithmetic-only quantization is an important approach in quantization and holds great significance for hardware deployment with limited resources. However, existing methods represented by IAO face challenges when balancing hardware efficiency and accuracy. They suffer from significant accuracy loss and the multipliers in element-wise layers are not constrained to be power-of-2. These issues limit the utilization of hardware resources. In this paper, we explore integer-arithmetic-only quantization and introduce two techniques: re-quantization and re-scale. Our approach ensures that inference in an 8-bit quantized network involves only 8-bit multiply-accumulate operations and bit-shifting. We compare our method with previous integer-arithmetic-only approaches and demonstrate that our approach not only accelerates inference speed and reduces resource consumption but also achieves minimal performance degradation. For the commonly used ResNet-50, our int8 model exhibits only a 0.5% drop in Top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming previous integer-arithmetic-only methods. Moreover, the proposed method frees up digital signal processing resources and improve parallelism, achieving an improvement of approximately 27% in frames per second and reducing inference time by 27.09 ms (19%). This showcases the practical value and effectiveness of our proposed method in improving the overall efficiency of model inference.",

Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported.

            "In severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), sedatives are often used to control intracranial pressure (ICP), to reduce brain metabolism, to allow for other treatments such as mechanical ventilation or targeted temperature management, or to control paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\u00a0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\u00a0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\u00a0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\u00a0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points.

            "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a significant global disease with high mortality and disability. As of now, there is no effective therapy available. Oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis play essential roles in ICH, determining neuronal survival. In our preliminary studies, we found that Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture could improve neurological deficits and neuropathological damage in the perihematomal area in ICH rats. The SIRT1/FOXO1 signaling pathway has been reported to mediate antioxidant and anti\u2010neuronal apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture on oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis after ICH and the role of SIRT1/FOXO1 in acupuncture's neuroprotection. ICH rat models were established by autologous tail blood (50 \u00b5L) infusion into the caudate nucleus. EX527, SIRT1\u2010specific inhibitor\u00a0was\u00a0intraperitoneally\u00a0administered 3 days before ICH.\u00a0Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin\u00a0acupuncture treatment was performed once a day for 30 min after ICH. Neurological deficits were evaluated using the modified neurological severity score (mNSS). Brain edema was evaluated using brain water content. HE staining and Nissl staining were used to evaluate neuropathological damage in the perihematomal area. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling was used to quantify neuronal apoptosis. Specific kits were used to detect the levels of SOD, CAT, GSH\u2010Px in the brain. The oxidative DNA damage was evaluated using enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay to detect the level of 8\u2010hydroxyguanosine (8\u2010OHdG). Western blot was used to evaluate the expressions of SIRT1, Ac\u2010FOXO1, FOXO1, Bcl\u20102, and Bax. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted to detect the cellular localization of SIRT1. Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture improved the neurological deficits and brain edema, reduced the pathological injury and neuronal degeneration in 3 days in the perihematomal area after ICH. Mechanistically, acupuncture reduced oxidative stress injury and neuronal apoptosis via activating SIRT1/FOXO1 pathway. The neuroprotective effects of acupuncture were abolished by injection of the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527. Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture could reduce oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, at least in part, through the SIRT1/FOXO1 signaling pathway, improving neurological deficits and neuropathological damage after ICH. These findings suggest that Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture is an effective therapy for ICH, as well as targeting SIRT1 signaling to promote neuron survival could be a potential therapeutic strategy.",

            "Nonsurgical root canal therapy (NSRCT) is indicated for management of permanent teeth diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. However, recent research has suggested that vital pulp therapy (VPT) may be a less invasive option in these cases. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the outcomes of VPT, using hydraulic calcium silicate cements (HCSCs) including complete and partial pulpotomies in permanent posterior teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. The PRISMA recommendations were adhered to. The search approach used electronic databases from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and grey literature. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, ROBINS-I, and Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tools were used to evaluate the quality of the selected studies. The initial database search turned up 142 papers, of which 3 prospective cohort studies and 9 randomised controlled trials were selected for analysis. For three, seven, and two articles, the risk of bias was rated as \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cserious,\u201d \u201cfair,\u201d and \u201clow,\u201d respectively. The success rates for VPT using HCSCs typically ranged from 78% to 90% one to five years following VPT. The results of the VPT and NSRCT were equivalent at one and five years, according to two articles. Although the intra-operative pulp assessment is essential for VPT treatments, most studies did not provide a thorough account of this process or the time required to achieve haemostasis. Three studies reported sample sizes that were < 23 teeth. The 12 studies that were analysed revealed successful VPT procedures using HCSCs in permanent posterior teeth that had symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, with radiographic success rates ranging from 81% to 90%. Two articles claimed that the results of VPT and root canal therapy were equivalent. When considering VPT as an alternative to NSRCT, appropriate case selection and outcome criteria must be created. This data highlights the need for additional studies contrasting the longer-term effects of different treatment regimens.",

            "Quantization is a widely adopted technique in model deployment as it offers a favorable trade-off between computational overhead and performance loss. Integer-arithmetic-only quantization is an important approach in quantization and holds great significance for hardware deployment with limited resources. However, existing methods represented by IAO face challenges when balancing hardware efficiency and accuracy. They suffer from significant accuracy loss and the multipliers in element-wise layers are not constrained to be power-of-2. These issues limit the utilization of hardware resources. In this paper, we explore integer-arithmetic-only quantization and introduce two techniques: re-quantization and re-scale. Our approach ensures that inference in an 8-bit quantized network involves only 8-bit multiply-accumulate operations and bit-shifting. We compare our method with previous integer-arithmetic-only approaches and demonstrate that our approach not only accelerates inference speed and reduces resource consumption but also achieves minimal performance degradation. For the commonly used ResNet-50, our int8 model exhibits only a 0.5% drop in Top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming previous integer-arithmetic-only methods. Moreover, the proposed method frees up digital signal processing resources and improve parallelism, achieving an improvement of approximately 27% in frames per second and reducing inference time by 27.09 ms (19%). This showcases the practical value and effectiveness of our proposed method in improving the overall efficiency of model inference.",
            "Previous studies have shown an association between the thalamocortical dysconnectivity and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Whether a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine may change thalamocortical connectivity among patients with TRD is unclear. Whether these changes in thalamocortical connectivity is associated with the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine treatment is also unclear. Two resting-state functional MRIs were collected in two clinical trials of 48 patients with TRD (clinical trial 1; 32 receiving ketamine, 16 receiving a normal saline placebo) and 48 patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation (clinical trial 2; 24 receiving ketamine, 24 receiving midazolam), respectively. All participants underwent rs-fMRI before and 3 days after infusion. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) was analyzed in the left/right thalamus. FCs between the bilateral thalamus and right middle frontal cortex (BA46) and between the left thalamus and left anterior paracingulate gyrus (BA8) increased among patients in the ketamine group in clinical trials 1 and 2, respectively.

The management of acute mercury vapor poisoning remains unclear, particularly in acute lung injury. We present a case of mercury vapor poisoning resulting from the heating of cinnabar, successfully treated with high-dose corticosteroids and chelation therapy, and follow-up over 6 months. A 47-year-old female patient was admitted to the Emergency Department due to dyspnea, chest tightness, and weakness following cinnabar heating. Upon admission, she presented with tachypnea and respiratory failure. During the first 5 days, the respiratory failure rapidly progressed, requiring high-flow nasal cannula support, and showed no improvement with broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics and 80\u2005mg daily IV methylprednisolone. Total blood and urinary mercury levels were measured to confirm the diagnosis. Upon confirmation of acute pneumonitis due to mercury vapor poisoning, the patient was administered high-dose methylprednisolone (500\u2005mg IV per day) and chelation therapy, which led to subsequent improvement. Six months after discharge, the patient completely recovered, as evidenced by chest imaging and pulmonary function tests. Heating elemental mercury can cause pneumonitis, leading to acute respiratory failure. A detailed history is crucial for diagnosis. High-dose methylprednisolone should be considered in patients who do not respond to lower doses. Patients should be monitored afterward to detect residual pulmonary fibrotic changes.",

            "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a form of severe acute stroke with very high mortality and disability rates. Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.",

The biological activity of HDPCs infected by LPS was measured using a cell counting kit (CCK-8), Transwell test, flow cytometry, and fluorescent quantitative PCR. The concentration of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) was evaluated using an assay kit, the levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the targeting relationship between SMAD5 and miR-152 was measured by the double-luciferase report test. The expression of cell cycle-related CyclinD1 and BAX was assessed by PCR. By plotting a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the diagnostic value of miR-152 was shown. The level of miR-152 in HDPCs induced by LPS decreased, while the level of SMAD5 increased. After overexpressing miR-152 in LPS-induced HDPCs, the viability was elevated, the apoptosis rate decreased, CyclinD1 was elevated, BAX diminished, the inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2) were inhibited, the activity of SOD increased, and the MDA content decreased. miR-152 targeted regulation of SMAD5, and SMAD5 modulated the effects of miR-152 on cell viability, apoptosis, inflammation, and the oxidative response of HDPCs. Reduced miR-152 expression was verified in patients with pulpitis, which could be a biomarker for pulpitis. miR-152 was found to be a biomarker correlated with the pathogenesis of pulpitis and the biological behaviour of HDPCs."

            "Fungal endocarditis (FE) is a rare form of infective endocarditis. Compared to bacterial endocarditis, FE develops more slowly and insidiously, with nonspecific clinical manifestations, making diagnosis more challenging. Cases presenting with low back pain as the initial symptom are exceedingly rare, leading to a high risk of misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. A 61-year-old male was admitted due to recurrent low back pain accompanied by fever for 2 months. He had no history of invasive procedures or immunosuppressive therapy. The patient was diagnosed with FE. The patient underwent surgical treatment, during which the excrescence was removed, and mitral valve replacement was performed. Postoperatively, he received a full course of antifungal therapy. Postoperatively, the patient experienced relief from low back pain and was afebrile. He was discharged after completing antifungal treatment and, upon follow-up after 1 year, had no recurrence of low back pain. In this case, the patient initially presented with low back pain, which, despite the presence of fever and other signs of infection, did not readily suggest a cardiac etiology. This case highlights the importance of not being misled by superficial symptoms and underscores the need for comprehensive and accurate physical examinations and targeted investigations for proper diagnosis.",

            "Despite advances in screening and prevention, cervical cancer (CC) remains an unresolved public health issue and poses a significant global challenge, particularly for women in low-income regions. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially with the high-risk strains, is a primary driver of cervical carcinogenesis. Emerging evidence indicates that integrating HPV testing with existing approaches, such as cervical cytology and visual inspection, offers enhanced sensitivity and specificity in CC screening. HPV infection-associated biomarkers, including HPV E6/E7 oncogenes, p16^INK4a, DNA methylation signatures, and non-coding RNAs, offer valuable insights into disease progression and the development of personalized interventions. Preventive and therapeutic vaccination against HPV, along with tertiary prevention strategies such as the use of antiviral and immune-modulating drugs for HPV-related lesions, show great clinical potential. At the mechanistic level, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and the development of organoid models for HPV infection provide new cellular and molecular insights into HPV-related CC pathogenesis. This review focuses on the crucial roles of HPV in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CC, with particular emphasis on the latest advancements in screening and disease intervention.",

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a deep learning-based multiclass semantic segmentation algorithm for OCT (OCT-AID). A reference standard was obtained through manual multiclass annotation (guidewire artefact, lumen, side branch, intima, media, lipid plaque, calcified plaque, thrombus, plaque rupture, and background) of OCT images from a representative subset of pullbacks from the PECTUS-obs study. Pullbacks were randomly divided into a training and internal test set. An additional independent dataset was used for external testing. In total, 2808 frames were used for training and 218 for internal testing. The external test set comprised 392 frames. On the internal test set, the mean Dice score across nine classes was 0.659 overall and 0.757 on the true-positive frames, ranging from 0.281 to 0.989 per class. Substantial to almost perfect agreement was achieved for frame-wise identification of both lipid (\u03ba=0.817, 95% CI 0.743\u20130.891) and calcified plaques (\u03ba=0.795, 95% CI 0.703\u20130.887).

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

Prior investigations have analyzed the overall comparative performance of LLM versions within different ophthalmology subspecialties. However, limited investigations have characterized LLM performance on image-based questions, a recent advance in LLM capabilities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (ChatGPT) versions 3.5 and 4.0 on image-based and text-only questions using oculoplastic\u00a0subspecialty questions from StatPearls and OphthoQuestions question banks. Methods: This study utilized 343 non-image questions from StatPearls, 127 images from StatPearls, and 89 OphthoQuestions. All of these questions were specific to Oculoplastics. The information collected included correctness, distribution of answers, and if an additional prompt was necessary. Text-only questions were compared between ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4.0. Also, text-only and multimodal (image-based) questions answered by ChatGPT-4.0 were compared. Results: ChatGPT-3.5 answered 56.85% (195/343) of text-only questions correctly, while ChatGPT-4.0 achieved 73.46% (252/343), showing a statistically significant difference in accuracy (p<0.05). The biserial correlation between ChatGPT-3.5 and human performance on the StatPearls question bank was 0.198, with a standard deviation of 0.195. When ChatGPT-3.5 was incorrect, the average human correctness was 49.39% (SD 26.27%), and when it was correct, human correctness averaged 57.82% (SD 30.14%) with a t-statistic of 3.57 and a p-value of 0.0004. For ChatGPT-4.0, the biserial correlation was 0.226\u00a0(SD 0.213). When ChatGPT-4.0 was incorrect, human correctness averaged 45.49% (SD 24.85%), and when it was correct, human correctness was 57.02% (SD 29.75%) with a t-statistic of 4.28 and a p-value of 0.0006. On image-only questions, ChatGPT-4.0 correctly answered 56.94% (123/216), significantly lower than its performance on text-only questions (p<0.05). Discussion and conclusion: This study shows that ChatGPT-4.0 performs better on the oculoplastic subspecialty than prior versions. However, significant challenges remain regarding accuracy, particularly when integrating image-based prompts.\u00a0While showing promise within medical education, further progress must be made regarding LLM reliability, and caution should be used until further advancement is achieved.",

              "content": "Patellar instability, often associated with medial patellofemoral ligament rupture, is prevalent in adolescents. Risk factors include trochlear dysplasia, patella alta, abnormal patellar tilt, and increased tibial tubercle to trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance. A variety of surgical options are available for addressing patellar instability, and the selection of each technique should be tailored to the unique pathoanatomy of each patient. Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLR) is indicated for patients with patellar instability, and tibial tubercle osteotomy (TTO) is indicated for patients with a TT-TG >20 mm. An anterior midline incision is performed to expose the patella, patellar tendon, and tibial tubercle. Diagnostic arthroscopy is performed to assess patellar engagement and cartilage integrity, followed by the TTO. Three guidewires are placed with 15\u00b0 of obliquity, to guide a 6-cm osteotomy, from medial to lateral and from proximal to distal. A distal cortical hinge must be left intact. A 15-mm medial resection of the tibial tubercle is performed to avoid protrusion against the skin, which is followed by medialization of the tubercle and fixation with K-wires until dynamic testing ensures proper alignment and definitive fixation is achieved with cannulated headless screws. A lateral retinacular lengthening is performed to balance patellar forces. MPFLR is executed using a semitendinosus allograft. The graft is anchored to the patella and drawn through a surgically created plane to the medial femoral condyle. The femoral tunnel is created under fluoroscopy guidance, and the graft is then passed and secured. Graft tension and patellar mobility are adjusted according to dynamic testing. Once patellar stability is achieved and maintained through range of motion, the graft is then fixed. Patients can expect improved clinical outcomes with a high return-to-sports rate following both isolated MPFLR and concomitant TTO. The combination of MPFLR + TTO significantly reduces revision rate, compared to isolated MPFLR in patients with increased TT-TG distance, and enhances postoperative patellofemoral tracking. MPFLR + TTO improves patellofemoral tracking and corrects patellar instability, substantially improving postoperative outcomes compared to MPFLR alone. Patients with patellar instability and an increased TT-TG may be effectively treated with MPFLR + TTO.

Initially described by Jones et al. in 2001, reconstruction with semitendinosus allograft via cerclage has been increasingly adopted in recent times, though this not been as well described in video journals. Operative management of AC joint separation is classically indicated in Rockwood grade IV or higher AC joint injuries and controversial for grade III separations. One such treatment is AC joint reconstruction with semitendinosus allograft as described in this 37-year-old male patient, with a grade IIIB AC joint separation. A 6-cm incision was created overlying the clavicle. No distal clavicle excision was performed, but coracoclavicular (CC) scar tissue was elevated with medial and lateral windows about the coracoid. A passing suture was placed around the coracoid, and holes were drilled in the clavicle at 17% and 31% of the total clavicle length, consistent with ratios described by Rios et al; 5-mm tunnels were created corresponding to the trapezial and conoid limbs of the CC ligaments and tapped to 5.5 mm. A semitendinosus allograft was passed and fixed with two 5.5 \u00d7 15 mm polyetheretherketone (PEEK) screws after primary fixation with a FiberTape cerclage looped around the coracoid and clavicle independently with use of a tensiometer for maximal tightening. A FiberTak was used to fix the additional graft limb at the acromion to stabilize the AC joint and reinforced on itself with 0 vicryl. The patient was placed in a sling and assigned physical therapy (PT) focusing on limiting shoulder abduction and forward flexion for the first 6 weeks. At 6 months postoperation, the patient continues to progress from PT, with low pain and near full range of motion. Although PT protocols vary widely, a full recovery is expected by 6 months, with the patient able to return to work, lifting no greater than 50 pounds. This study describes the treatment of an acute grade IV AC joint separation in a 37-year-old male patient. Further adoption of AC joint reconstruction utilizing a semitendinosus allograft via cerclage continues to be a viable option for patients requiring operative management.

We looked at what manual wheelchair training approaches exist for adults who need to use a manual wheelchair and what training helps people to do/achieve. We did a scoping review that looked at literature about manual wheelchair training programs for adult wheelchair users. We found 87 research papers and training programs that we included in our review. We recorded and analysed information from all the papers about the wheelchair training programs and outcomes for people who do these programs. We found that manual wheelchair training can be done in structured or ad hoc ways, can have different amounts of training, can be provided face\u2010to\u2010face or online, and can be given by different allied health professionals and other wheelchair users. Most training programs had short\u2010term outcomes like learning manual wheelchair skills, being able to use the wheelchair properly, and feeling confident about using a wheelchair. Some had longer term outcomes about being able to use the manual wheelchair in everyday activities. Most people who did the training programs that we looked at in this review were manual wheelchair users with spinal cord injury. Because not many wheelchair programs have been tried with people who do not have a spinal cord injury, it is hard for occupational therapists to make recommendations about training for other people who use a manual wheelchair.

The position and size of original femoral and tibial tunnels are critical in the surgical decision-making in the setting of revision ACL reconstruction. This video presents a case of stage I revision ACL reconstruction with the use of allograft bone dowels due to increased size and poor position of original fixation tunnels. Indications for staging revision ACL reconstruction include significant tunnel osteolysis or dilation (>14 mm), or any situation in which the previous bone tunnels will interfere with anatomic graft placement and fixation. The patient is placed in the supine position with a standard setup for knee arthroscopy, including lateral thigh post and foot stop for maintained knee flexion at 90\u00b0. After diagnostic arthroscopy, the ACL graft remnant is debrided. The femoral tunnel is then debrided and re-cannulated, followed by reaming with cannulated reamers until adequate cortical chatter is achieved, ensuring the presence of a bleeding rim of bone throughout the tunnel to confirm that the correct diameter reamer has been reached. The appropriately sized bone dowel is inserted along the guide pin until fully seated and flush with lateral wall of the notch. This process is then repeated for the tibial tunnel, accessing the tunnel from the previous incision along the medial tibia. This video presents a technique to achieve adequate bone grafting of previously used tunnels that are not suitable for single-stage revision ACL reconstruction. Patients undergo second-stage revision ACL reconstruction at roughly 4 to 6 months following stage I, when bone graft has fully incorporated on radiographs. Stage I revision ACL reconstruction with tunnel grafting using allograft bone dowels is a minimally invasive method of grafting previously used fixation tunnels to allow for anatomic second-stage graft placement and fixation.

The aim of this study is to report a double-row all-suture labral fixation technique using knotless anchors. Step 1: glenohumeral debridement, and preparation of the glenoid labral and Bankart. The patient is first placed in the beach-chair position and surface landmarks are created. The standard posterior portal is first created and the glenohumeral joint is evaluated. Once the lesion is identified, the relevant working anterosuperior and anteroinferior portals are established using the outside-in technique. The synovitis is debrided to allow visualization and the labrum is liberated from the anterior glenoid. The Bankart lesion fragment is liberated, and partial fragments are osteotomized. With the anterolateral portal as the viewing portal, the anterior rim of the glenoid is now decorticated using a motorized shaver and rasp to create a bleeding bony surface. Step 2: the low rim anchor (5:30 o\u2019clock).

Step 4: the knotless high rim anchor (3 o\u2019clock). Step 5: tying of sutures. The sutures from each anchor are tied in a mattress configuration, eventually creating a suture bridge over the labral repair This dual row labral repair technique allows for maximum compression and contact between the fragment and the glenoid bed, allowing healing over a contact area rather than just the rim. The other added advantage is the use of curved tip anchors which allow negotiation of difficult corners, especially in the 5 to 6 o\u2019clock position.",

            "Intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides detailed information on coronary lesions, but interpretation of OCT images is time-consuming and subject to interobserver variability. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a deep learning-based multiclass semantic segmentation algorithm for OCT (OCT-AID). A reference standard was obtained through manual multiclass annotation (guidewire artefact, lumen, side branch, intima, media, lipid plaque, calcified plaque, thrombus, plaque rupture, and background) of OCT images from a representative subset of pullbacks from the PECTUS-obs study. Pullbacks were randomly divided into a training and internal test set. An additional independent dataset was used for external testing. In total, 2808 frames were used for training and 218 for internal testing. The external test set comprised 392 frames. On the internal test set, the mean Dice score across nine classes was 0.659 overall and 0.757 on the true-positive frames, ranging from 0.281 to 0.989 per class. Substantial to almost perfect agreement was achieved for frame-wise identification of both lipid (\u03ba=0.817, 95% CI 0.743\u20130.891) and calcified plaques (\u03ba=0.795, 95% CI 0.703\u20130.887). For plaque quantification (e.g. lipid arc, calcium thickness), intraclass correlations of 0.664\u20130.884 were achieved. In the external test set, \u03ba-values for lipid and calcified plaques were 0.720 (95% CI 0.640\u20130.800) and 0.851 (95% CI 0.794\u20130.908), respectively. The developed multiclass semantic segmentation method for intracoronary OCT images demonstrated promising capabilities for various classes, while having included difficult frames, such as those containing artefacts or destabilized plaques. This algorithm is an important step towards comprehensive and standardized OCT image interpretation.",
            "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

One objective of the study was to develop a predictive model utilizing these markers to detect high-risk individuals early on. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 184 cases of patients with cirrhosis who underwent splenectomy at The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China from January 2015 to September 2023. The cohort was randomly divided into training ( n n According to univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found six prediction indexes of PVT in patients with cirrhosis after splenectomy: postoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), postoperative derived NLR (dNLR), C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR), portal vein diameter (DPV), platelet change value (PVB), and D-dimer ( p Postoperative NLR, dNLR, CAR, PVB, DPV, and D-dimer were identified as the independent risk factors of PVT in cirrhotic patients post splenectomy.

            "To explore potential caries risk indicators in 3- to 5-year-old children, and develop a simple risk-score model to screen the children at high risk of caries with decayed, filled, and missing teeth (dmft) > 2. A cross-sectional study involving 2746 children 3 to 5 years of age was conducted in Sichuan province. Children were examined for dmft index, and sociodemographic and behavioural factors were acquried through a questionnaire completed by their caregivers. A prediction model was developed by backward multivariate logistic regression, and its overfitting degree was examined with 5-fold cross-validation. A simple risk-score model was derived to screen the children with dmft > 2 at high risk of caries with the \u03b2 regression coefficient obtained from the multivariate regression model. A child\u2019s oral health status was identified as the highest risk indicator with a \u03b2 regression coefficient of 1.093. The mean area under curve (AUC) from the 5-fold cross-validation was 0.7408 (95% CI: 72.21%, 75.95%), with a bias of only ca 1%. This result allowed us to eliminate substantial overfitting of the prediction model. The AUC of the risk scoring system was 0.7455 (95% CI: 72.70%, 76.40%), which indicated good screenability. This risk score model has the advantages of simplicity, low cost and relatively high accuracy, and is suitable for use in developing countries, especially for primary screening for high risk of caries. It shows that certain child behaviours and parental attitude play an important role in dental caries among preschool children.",
            "Social media has contributed to a potentially unsafe trend of nighttime mouth taping for individuals with mouth breathing, sleep disordered breathing, or sleep apnea as a home remedy to treat these issues.

Using search terms, \u201cmouth taping, adhesive mouthpiece, porous oral patch, surgical tape, breathing mouthpiece, sleep, microsleep, breath, breathing, or mouth breathing\u201d, MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched from February 1999 to February 2024. Covidence software was used for screening and data entry performed into a data collection sheet designed  a priori. Covidence software was utilized to screen 120 articles. After 34 duplicates were removed, 86 articles were screened by two independent reviewers. Sixty-two were excluded. Twenty-four went on to full text review and 10 met inclusion criteria with a total of 213 patients. Two studies showed statistically significant improvement in established markers of sleep apnea such as apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or oxygen desaturations. Other studies showed that mouth taping offered no differences and even discussed potential risks including asphyxiation in the presence of nasal obstruction. Many studies excluded anyone with nasal obstruction or pathology. The social media trend of mouth taping for individuals with mouth breathing, sleep disordered breathing, or sleep apnea has been reviewed. Based on the data presented by these 10 different studies, it seems that there is a potentially serious risk of harm for individuals indiscriminately practicing this trend.

            "Introduction: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant interest in their potential use as medical assistive tools. Prior investigations have analyzed the overall comparative performance of LLM versions within different ophthalmology subspecialties. However, limited investigations have characterized LLM performance on image-based questions, a recent advance in LLM capabilities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (ChatGPT) versions 3.5 and 4.0 on image-based and text-only questions using oculoplastic\u00a0subspecialty questions from StatPearls and OphthoQuestions question banks. Methods: This study utilized 343 non-image questions from StatPearls, 127 images from StatPearls, and 89 OphthoQuestions. All of these questions were specific to Oculoplastics. The information collected included correctness, distribution of answers, and if an additional prompt was necessary. Text-only questions were compared between ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4.0. Also, text-only and multimodal (image-based) questions answered by ChatGPT-4.0 were compared. Results: ChatGPT-3.5 answered 56.85% (195/343) of text-only questions correctly, while ChatGPT-4.0 achieved 73.46% (252/343), showing a statistically significant difference in accuracy (p<0.05). The biserial correlation between ChatGPT-3.5 and human performance on the StatPearls question bank was 0.198, with a standard deviation of 0.195. When ChatGPT-3.5 was incorrect, the average human correctness was 49.39% (SD 26.27%), and when it was correct, human correctness averaged 57.82% (SD 30.14%) with a t-statistic of 3.57 and a p-value of 0.0004. For ChatGPT-4.0, the biserial correlation was 0.226\u00a0(SD 0.213). When ChatGPT-4.0 was incorrect, human correctness averaged 45.49% (SD 24.85%), and when it was correct, human correctness was 57.02% (SD 29.75%) with a t-statistic of 4.28 and a p-value of 0.0006. On image-only questions, ChatGPT-4.0 correctly answered 56.94% (123/216), significantly lower than its performance on text-only questions (p<0.05). Discussion and conclusion: This study shows that ChatGPT-4.0 performs better on the oculoplastic subspecialty than prior versions. However, significant challenges remain regarding accuracy, particularly when integrating image-based prompts.\u00a0While showing promise within medical education, further progress must be made regarding LLM reliability, and caution should be used until further advancement is achieved.",
            "Patellar instability, often associated with medial patellofemoral ligament rupture, is prevalent in adolescents. Risk factors include trochlear dysplasia, patella alta, abnormal patellar tilt, and increased tibial tubercle to trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance. A variety of surgical options are available for addressing patellar instability, and the selection of each technique should be tailored to the unique pathoanatomy of each patient. Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLR) is indicated for patients with patellar instability, and tibial tubercle osteotomy (TTO) is indicated for patients with a TT-TG >20 mm. An anterior midline incision is performed to expose the patella, patellar tendon, and tibial tubercle. Diagnostic arthroscopy is performed to assess patellar engagement and cartilage integrity, followed by the TTO. Three guidewires are placed with 15\u00b0 of obliquity, to guide a 6-cm osteotomy, from medial to lateral and from proximal to distal. A distal cortical hinge must be left intact. A 15-mm medial resection of the tibial tubercle is performed to avoid protrusion against the skin, which is followed by medialization of the tubercle and fixation with K-wires until dynamic testing ensures proper alignment and definitive fixation is achieved with cannulated headless screws. A lateral retinacular lengthening is performed to balance patellar forces. MPFLR is executed using a semitendinosus allograft. The graft is anchored to the patella and drawn through a surgically created plane to the medial femoral condyle. The femoral tunnel is created under fluoroscopy guidance, and the graft is then passed and secured. Graft tension and patellar mobility are adjusted according to dynamic testing. Once patellar stability is achieved and maintained through range of motion, the graft is then fixed. Patients can expect improved clinical outcomes with a high return-to-sports rate following both isolated MPFLR and concomitant TTO. The combination of MPFLR + TTO significantly reduces revision rate, compared to isolated MPFLR in patients with increased TT-TG distance, and enhances postoperative patellofemoral tracking. MPFLR + TTO improves patellofemoral tracking and corrects patellar instability, substantially improving postoperative outcomes compared to MPFLR alone. Patients with patellar instability and an increased TT-TG may be effectively treated with MPFLR + TTO.

            "Acromioclavicular (AC) joint separations occur most often in young male patients, commonly in athletes. Initially described by Jones et al. in 2001, reconstruction with semitendinosus allograft via cerclage has been increasingly adopted in recent times, though this not been as well described in video journals. Operative management of AC joint separation is classically indicated in Rockwood grade IV or higher AC joint injuries and controversial for grade III separations. One such treatment is AC joint reconstruction with semitendinosus allograft as described in this 37-year-old male patient, with a grade IIIB AC joint separation. A 6-cm incision was created overlying the clavicle. No distal clavicle excision was performed, but coracoclavicular (CC) scar tissue was elevated with medial and lateral windows about the coracoid. A passing suture was placed around the coracoid, and holes were drilled in the clavicle at 17% and 31% of the total clavicle length, consistent with ratios described by Rios et al; 5-mm tunnels were created corresponding to the trapezial and conoid limbs of the CC ligaments and tapped to 5.5 mm. A semitendinosus allograft was passed and fixed with two 5.5 \u00d7 15 mm polyetheretherketone (PEEK) screws after primary fixation with a FiberTape cerclage looped around the coracoid and clavicle independently with use of a tensiometer for maximal tightening. A FiberTak was used to fix the additional graft limb at the acromion to stabilize the AC joint and reinforced on itself with 0 vicryl. The patient was placed in a sling and assigned physical therapy (PT) focusing on limiting shoulder abduction and forward flexion for the first 6 weeks. At 6 months postoperation, the patient continues to progress from PT, with low pain and near full range of motion. Although PT protocols vary widely, a full recovery is expected by 6 months, with the patient able to return to work, lifting no greater than 50 pounds. This study describes the treatment of an acute grade IV AC joint separation in a 37-year-old male patient. Further adoption of AC joint reconstruction utilizing a semitendinosus allograft via cerclage continues to be a viable option for patients requiring operative management.

A systematic scoping review involved searching eight electronic databases and grey literature up to September 2023. Papers relating to manual wheelchair training for adults and their caregivers were included for data extraction. Eighty\u2010seven articles were included in this review. The International Classification of Functioning (ICF) was used to organise and analyse data related to intended training outcomes. Consumer consultation was not included in this review; however, the outcomes suggest that involving consumers in future wheelchair training research is critical to assure community participation outcomes. Data were extracted from 87 papers. Manual wheelchair training was delivered across diverse contexts encompassing varied support structures, trainer backgrounds, and technology and was commonly directed towards wheelchair users with spinal cord injury. Intended training outcomes most frequently mapped to the activity and participation component of the ICF ( n n n n Most existing manual wheelchair training focussed on the acquisition of individual wheelchair skill and may not facilitate generalised and long\u2010term occupational participation outcomes. Further exploration into the contexts that support occupational engagement, particularly for older adults with progressive conditions, is required to support service provision. We looked at what manual wheelchair training approaches exist for adults who need to use a manual wheelchair and what training helps people to do/achieve. We did a scoping review that looked at literature about manual wheelchair training programs for adult wheelchair users. We found 87 research papers and training programs that we included in our review. We recorded and analysed information from all the papers about the wheelchair training programs and outcomes for people who do these programs. We found that manual wheelchair training can be done in structured or ad hoc ways, can have different amounts of training, can be provided face\u2010to\u2010face or online, and can be given by different allied health professionals and other wheelchair users. Most training programs had short\u2010term outcomes like learning manual wheelchair skills, being able to use the wheelchair properly, and feeling confident about using a wheelchair. Some had longer term outcomes about being able to use the manual wheelchair in everyday activities. Most people who did the training programs that we looked at in this review were manual wheelchair users with spinal cord injury. Because not many wheelchair programs have been tried with people who do not have a spinal cord injury, it is hard for occupational therapists to make recommendations about training for other people who use a manual wheelchair. Manual wheelchair training that is done in the community and made to meet the needs of individuals may help people with using their wheelchair for their everyday activities and participate in their community.",
            "During the last two decades, extended scientific interest focused on quadrilateral plate (QLP) fractures as part of common acetabular fractures. The QLP corresponds to the medial wall of the acetabulum, and different fracture pattern of Letournel\u00b4s fracture types are associated with concomitant QLP fractures. Except anterior and posterior wall fractures, all other fracture types may be associated with QLP fractures. QLP fracture features include simple fracture lines up to highly comminuted fractures. A detailed preoperative analysis of these fractures is important to get a better understanding of intraoperative decision making. No consensus exists regarding the optimal classification and treatment of QLP fractures. Various operative approaches and treatment concepts exists depending on the specific QLP fracture type and the acetabular fracture type. Several new implants were development for optimal but often individual stabilization concepts. The gold-standard is still some medial buttressing during internal fixation predominantly using plates, but also screw fixation is considered an option. Additional dome impactions must be considered as an integral part in any QLP fracture analysis and stabilization.",

            "When evaluating a patient with a failed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, a detailed history and physical examination is paramount. The position and size of original femoral and tibial tunnels are critical in the surgical decision-making in the setting of revision ACL reconstruction. This video presents a case of stage I revision ACL reconstruction with the use of allograft bone dowels due to increased size and poor position of original fixation tunnels. Indications for staging revision ACL reconstruction include significant tunnel osteolysis or dilation (>14 mm), or any situation in which the previous bone tunnels will interfere with anatomic graft placement and fixation. The patient is placed in the supine position with a standard setup for knee arthroscopy, including lateral thigh post and foot stop for maintained knee flexion at 90\u00b0. After diagnostic arthroscopy, the ACL graft remnant is debrided. The femoral tunnel is then debrided and re-cannulated, followed by reaming with cannulated reamers until adequate cortical chatter is achieved, ensuring the presence of a bleeding rim of bone throughout the tunnel to confirm that the correct diameter reamer has been reached. The appropriately sized bone dowel is inserted along the guide pin until fully seated and flush with lateral wall of the notch. This process is then repeated for the tibial tunnel, accessing the tunnel from the previous incision along the medial tibia. This video presents a technique to achieve adequate bone grafting of previously used tunnels that are not suitable for single-stage revision ACL reconstruction. Patients undergo second-stage revision ACL reconstruction at roughly 4 to 6 months following stage I, when bone graft has fully incorporated on radiographs. Stage I revision ACL reconstruction with tunnel grafting using allograft bone dowels is a minimally invasive method of grafting previously used fixation tunnels to allow for anatomic second-stage graft placement and fixation.

            "The most common technique described for bankart repair is the single-row labral repair. Recent interest has been the use of a dual-row, double pulley technique, first described by Zhang et al and popularized by Millett et al as the \u201cbony Bankart bridge\u201d technique. The aim of this study is to report a double-row all-suture labral fixation technique using knotless anchors. Step 1: glenohumeral debridement, and preparation of the glenoid labral and Bankart. The patient is first placed in the beach-chair position and surface landmarks are created. The standard posterior portal is first created and the glenohumeral joint is evaluated. Once the lesion is identified, the relevant working anterosuperior and anteroinferior portals are established using the outside-in technique. The synovitis is debrided to allow visualization and the labrum is liberated from the anterior glenoid. The Bankart lesion fragment is liberated, and partial fragments are osteotomized. With the anterolateral portal as the viewing portal, the anterior rim of the glenoid is now decorticated using a motorized shaver and rasp to create a bleeding bony surface. Step 2: the low rim anchor (5:30 o\u2019clock). At the anterior-inferior aspect of the glenoid, the drill guide is positioned as low as possible (5:30 o\u2019clock position for the right shoulder) and about 7 to 10 mm medial to the rim of the glenoid. The first 1.8 mm single-loaded suture anchor (Q-FIX All-Suture Anchor) is then inserted via the posterior portal. Step 3: the anterior-inferior-medial (AIM) anchor (4 o\u2019clock). Step 4: the knotless high rim anchor (3 o\u2019clock). Step 5: tying of sutures. The sutures from each anchor are tied in a mattress configuration, eventually creating a suture bridge over the labral repair This dual row labral repair technique allows for maximum compression and contact between the fragment and the glenoid bed, allowing healing over a contact area rather than just the rim. The other added advantage is the use of curved tip anchors which allow negotiation of difficult corners, especially in the 5 to 6 o\u2019clock position."

However, it might be meaningful to adjust the level at which personality is measured and reported, depending on the narrowness of the scope of the criteria of interest. This study firstly explored the inter-factor correlations of the 10 personality aspects of the Work Personality Index (WPI) from an archival dataset of 4759 South African employees. An oblique lower-order model was specified to investigate the inter-factor correlations between personality aspects. Secondly, a dominance analysis was performed using a sequentially collected cross-sectional sample of 197 South African employees, to determine the relative weight that each of the 10 aspects carries when predicting five narrower dimensions of performance. The 10 aspects exhibited unique patterns in predicting narrower performance dimensions. Scientists and practitioners might, therefore, benefit from modelling relationships between personality aspects and narrower performance areas. In accordance, more nuanced selection decisions or development recommendations can be made that are specific to the work behaviours of interest. The present study is the first to explore the criterion validity of the 10 personality aspects against five performance areas in the South African context. The study underscores the importance of a more nuanced understanding of the work-related implications of narrower personality characteristics, which have practical implications for both selection decisions and developmental recommendations within organisational settings.",

The inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials and cohort studies published between June 16, 2017 and June 16, 2022, laboratory assessment of prenatal vitamin D status and evaluation of primary or mixed dentition for observation of dental caries and developmental defects of enamel. The risk of bias for randomised controlled trials was analysed according to the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess risk of bias for cohort studies. A total of 177 studies were identified, 11 were included in the data synthesis. Eight out of 11 studies were considered as high quality and the other 3 studies had moderate risk of bias. The synthesis of data revealed that the impact of prenatal vitamin D status on oral health in children is quite controversial and subsequent studies are necessary to examine whether vitamin D levels affect the risk of developing dental caries and enamel defects. The effect of prenatal vitamin D on oral health in offspring is not entirely clear. Since disturbances in dental hard tissues have a polyetiological origin, health specialists need to notify mothers about other possible risk factors and emphasise the importance of eating habits and individual oral hygiene in early childhood.",
            "Recent evidence suggests that personality could play just as important a role in the prediction of important work-related outcomes as cognitive ability. However, it might be meaningful to adjust the level at which personality is measured and reported, depending on the narrowness of the scope of the criteria of interest. This study firstly explored the inter-factor correlations of the 10 personality aspects of the Work Personality Index (WPI) from an archival dataset of 4759 South African employees. An oblique lower-order model was specified to investigate the inter-factor correlations between personality aspects. Secondly, a dominance analysis was performed using a sequentially collected cross-sectional sample of 197 South African employees, to determine the relative weight that each of the 10 aspects carries when predicting five narrower dimensions of performance. The 10 aspects exhibited unique patterns in predicting narrower performance dimensions. Scientists and practitioners might, therefore, benefit from modelling relationships between personality aspects and narrower performance areas. In accordance, more nuanced selection decisions or development recommendations can be made that are specific to the work behaviours of interest. The present study is the first to explore the criterion validity of the 10 personality aspects against five performance areas in the South African context. The study underscores the importance of a more nuanced understanding of the work-related implications of narrower personality characteristics, which have practical implications for both selection decisions and developmental recommendations within organisational settings.",
            "Emergency physicians have the highest rates of burnout among all specialties. Existing burnout tools include the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and single\u2010item measures from the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). While both were designed to measure burnout, how they conceptualize this phenomenon differs and their agreement is unclear. Given the close conceptual relationship between emotional regulation strategies such as distancing and distraction with the MBI subscale of depersonalization, we examined agreement between the two inventories and association with emotional regulation strategies as a lens to explore the conceptualization of burnout. We conducted a cross\u2010sectional survey of adult and pediatric emergency physicians and trainees in Canada. Survey questions were pretested using written feedback and cognitive interviews. \u201cFrequent use\u201d of an emotional regulation strategy was \u201cmost\u201d or \u201call\u201d shifts (\u22654 on 5\u2010point Likert scale). Burnout was defined as mean \u226550/100 on the CBI and scoring \u22655 (out of 7) on at least one of the single\u2010item measures from the MBI. Associations with burnout were examined using multivariable logistic regression. Of 147 respondents, 44.2% were positive for burnout on the CBI and 44.9% on the single\u2010item measures from the MBI. Disagreement was 21.1% overall, ranging from 12.5% for older (\u226555\u2009years) physicians to 30.2% for younger (<35\u2009years) physicians. Use of distraction and use of distancing were strongly associated with burnout on the single\u2010item measures (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 14.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4\u201360.8]) and CBI (aOR 10.1, 95% CI 2.5\u201339.8, respectively.

Two years prior, she had multiple admissions for abdominal pain and rectal bleeding, initially diagnosed as diverticulitis. Following Hartmann's procedure for a sealed perforation, she developed diversion colitis. Subsequent symptoms included abdominal pain, vomiting, and high stoma output, with CT imaging revealing upstream colitis and para-stomal cellulitis. Biopsies confirmed severe inflammation and ulceration consistent with UC. The patient was treated with intravenous hydrocortisone, but her symptoms rebounded upon steroid tapering. Vedolizumab was considered due to her venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk. Post-treatment, her stoma output and skin irritation improved.

While the mechanisms underlying this association are unclear, early CP have also been linked with peer victimization and internalizing problems. The goals of the current study were: (1) to examine peer victimization and internalizing problems as potential serial mediators explaining increased medical and psychiatric service use in adolescents with a history of childhood CP, and; (2) to explore whether the proposed mediation models vary by sex. Participants ( N Adolescents with childhood CP reported higher medical and psychiatric service use than non-CP peers. Peer victimization and internalizing problems significantly mediated this association in both general medical and psychiatric service use models. The models did not vary by sex. Findings support higher levels of service use in adolescents with a history of CP, mediated by peer victimization and internalizing problems. Specifically, results highlight the importance of examining peer and socioemotional factors that may explain the increased service usage observed among youth with CP, to support better health outcomes.",
            "Tumorigenesis, like most complex genetic traits, is driven by the joint actions of many mutations. At the nucleotide level, such mutations are cancer-driving nucleotides (CDNs). The full sets of CDNs are necessary, and perhaps even sufficient, for the understanding and treatment of each cancer patient. Currently, only a small fraction of CDNs is known as most mutations accrued in tumors are not drivers. We now develop the theory of CDNs on the basis that cancer evolution is massively repeated in millions of individuals.

This report aims to emphasize the importance of considering AMNs in the differential diagnosis of atypical pelvic symptoms, especially when initial evaluations suggest gynecological issues. A 56-year-old female with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia and a total vaginal hysterectomy performed over 20 years prior for abnormal uterine bleeding due to fibroids presented to her gynecologist with a three-week history of vaginal discharge and pelvic pain. Initial gynecological assessments were unremarkable, prompting a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which revealed a markedly dilated, fluid-filled appendix, indicative of a mucinous neoplasm. The patient underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, which confirmed a low-grade AMN with clear margins. Post-surgical follow-up showed no recurrence, and a surveillance colonoscopy one year later revealed a benign tubular adenoma. This case highlights the need to consider AMNs in the differential diagnosis of pelvic symptoms, particularly when initial gynecological evaluations do not identify a clear cause. AMNs can present with symptoms that overlap with those of gynecological conditions, making accurate diagnosis challenging. Effective management through early recognition and surgical intervention is important to prevent complications. This report demonstrates the value of comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and the importance of including rare tumors in the differential diagnosis of atypical pelvic symptoms."

Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype.

              "content": "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is a complex neurological phenomenon that is actually very common. AMI can appear following a knee injury or knee surgery. If it is not addressed, the patient's function can be negatively affected. There is currently no specific tool for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI. Following surgery or injury to the knee, AMI causes defective activation of the quadriceps, sometimes combined with a knee extension deficit. A clinical classification of AMI has been proposed recently to help with making the diagnosis and to guide treatment. In this article, we describe how biofeedback and surface electromyography (EMG) can be used in the early diagnosis and treatment of knee AMI. Biofeedback is based on transformation of physiological variables into a visual or auditory signal. This allows the patient to learn how to control physical and bodily functions, which were previously considered as involuntary processes. This technique requires the use of a specific device that transforms the measured physiological signals\u2014neuromuscular activation in this instance\u2014into visual signals. This tool incorporates surface EMG, with electrodes connected to a measuring unit. This unit is connected to a screen that shows the neuromuscular activation in real time. Thus, EMG biofeedback can be used to help clinicians make a diagnosis and to specifically treat the AMI. We have used biofeedback in patients who have a knee injury or who have undergone knee surgery. Both the therapist and patient were able to objectively see the presence of AMI using the biofeedback device. For treatment, the therapist works with a patient by providing clear instructions and increasingly more challenging goals. We show examples of how patients were able to eliminate their AMI by using biofeedback. EMG biofeedback is a promising tool for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear and ACL reconstruction surgery. The next steps are to define thresholds and a rehabilitation protocol that will be used in a clinical trial.

Ubiquitination, coordinated by E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, involves up to 40 E2-conjugating enzymes in humans to specify substrates and ubiquitin linkages. In a screen for E2 dependencies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 N (UBE2N) emerged as the top candidate. To investigate UBE2N\u2019s role in AML, we characterized an enzymatically defective mouse model of UBE2N, revealing UBE2N\u2019s requirement in AML without an impact on normal hematopoiesis. Unlike other E2s, which mediate lysine-48 (K48) polyubiquitination and degradation of proteins, UBE2N primarily synthesizes K63-linked chains, stabilizing or altering protein function. Proteomic analyses and a whole-genome CRISPR-activation screen in pharmacologically and genetically UBE2N-inhibited AML cells unveiled a network of UBE2N-regulated proteins, many of which are implicated in cancer. UBE2N inhibition reduced their protein levels, leading to increased K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation through the immunoproteasome and revealing UBE2N activity is enriched in immunoproteasome-positive AML. Furthermore, an interactome screen identified tripartite motif\u2013containing protein 21 (TRIM21) as the E3 ligase partnering with activated UBE2N in AML to modulate UBE2N-dependent proteostasis. In conclusion, UBE2N maintains proteostasis in AML by stabilizing target proteins through K63-linked ubiquitination and prevention of K48 ubiquitin\u2013mediated degradation by the immunoproteasome. Thus, inhibition of UBE2N catalytic function suppresses leukemic cells through selective degradation of critical proteins in immunoproteasome-positive AML.",

The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.",

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

            "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions. In this review, we highlight current findings on the role of ILCs and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma development and pathogenesis. We also examine the underlying mechanisms regulating their function and their interplay with other immune cells. Finally, we explore current therapies targeting these cells and their effector cytokines for asthma management.",
            "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is a complex neurological phenomenon that is actually very common. AMI can appear following a knee injury or knee surgery. If it is not addressed, the patient's function can be negatively affected. There is currently no specific tool for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI. Following surgery or injury to the knee, AMI causes defective activation of the quadriceps, sometimes combined with a knee extension deficit. A clinical classification of AMI has been proposed recently to help with making the diagnosis and to guide treatment. In this article, we describe how biofeedback and surface electromyography (EMG) can be used in the early diagnosis and treatment of knee AMI. Biofeedback is based on transformation of physiological variables into a visual or auditory signal. This allows the patient to learn how to control physical and bodily functions, which were previously considered as involuntary processes. This technique requires the use of a specific device that transforms the measured physiological signals\u2014neuromuscular activation in this instance\u2014into visual signals. This tool incorporates surface EMG, with electrodes connected to a measuring unit. This unit is connected to a screen that shows the neuromuscular activation in real time. Thus, EMG biofeedback can be used to help clinicians make a diagnosis and to specifically treat the AMI. We have used biofeedback in patients who have a knee injury or who have undergone knee surgery. Both the therapist and patient were able to objectively see the presence of AMI using the biofeedback device. For treatment, the therapist works with a patient by providing clear instructions and increasingly more challenging goals. We show examples of how patients were able to eliminate their AMI by using biofeedback. EMG biofeedback is a promising tool for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear and ACL reconstruction surgery. The next steps are to define thresholds and a rehabilitation protocol that will be used in a clinical trial.

            "Altered protein homeostasis through proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins is a hallmark of many cancers. Ubiquitination, coordinated by E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, involves up to 40 E2-conjugating enzymes in humans to specify substrates and ubiquitin linkages. In a screen for E2 dependencies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 N (UBE2N) emerged as the top candidate. To investigate UBE2N\u2019s role in AML, we characterized an enzymatically defective mouse model of UBE2N, revealing UBE2N\u2019s requirement in AML without an impact on normal hematopoiesis. Unlike other E2s, which mediate lysine-48 (K48) polyubiquitination and degradation of proteins, UBE2N primarily synthesizes K63-linked chains, stabilizing or altering protein function. Proteomic analyses and a whole-genome CRISPR-activation screen in pharmacologically and genetically UBE2N-inhibited AML cells unveiled a network of UBE2N-regulated proteins, many of which are implicated in cancer. UBE2N inhibition reduced their protein levels, leading to increased K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation through the immunoproteasome and revealing UBE2N activity is enriched in immunoproteasome-positive AML. Furthermore, an interactome screen identified tripartite motif\u2013containing protein 21 (TRIM21) as the E3 ligase partnering with activated UBE2N in AML to modulate UBE2N-dependent proteostasis. In conclusion, UBE2N maintains proteostasis in AML by stabilizing target proteins through K63-linked ubiquitination and prevention of K48 ubiquitin\u2013mediated degradation by the immunoproteasome. Thus, inhibition of UBE2N catalytic function suppresses leukemic cells through selective degradation of critical proteins in immunoproteasome-positive AML.",
            "The vestibular system is integral to behavior; the loss of peripheral vestibular function leads to disabling consequences, such as blurred vision, dizziness, and unstable posture, severely limiting activities of daily living. Fortunately, the vestibular system\u2019s well-defined peripheral structure and well-understood encoding strategies offer unique opportunities for developing sensory prostheses to restore vestibular function. While these devices show promising results in both animal models and implanted patients, substantial room for improvement remains. Research from an engineering perspective has largely focused on optimizing stimulation protocol to improve outcomes. However, this approach has often been pursued in isolation from research in neuroscience that has enriched our understanding of neural responses at the synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels. Accordingly, this review bridges the domains of neuroscience and engineering to consider recent progress and challenges in vestibular prosthesis development. We advocate for interdisciplinary approaches that leverage studies of neural circuits at the population level, especially in light of recent advancement in large-scale recording technology, to identify impediments still to overcome and to develop more naturalistic stimulation strategies. Fully integrating neuroscience and engineering in the context of prosthesis development will help advance the field forward and ultimately improve patient outcomes.",
            "The therapeutic potential of gene editing technologies hinges on the development of safe and effective delivery methods.

Recent advances have begun to overcome one of the major limiting factors of this technology, namely delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing machinery, by utilizing viral vectors. However, gene editing therapies have yet to be implemented due to inherent risks associated with the DNA viral vectors typically used for delivery.

            "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an efficient treatment for movement disorders, most commonly Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), dystonia and essential tremor. DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.",
            "Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) is considered one of the main and serious problems facing the electrical grid. It occurs due to three-phase symmetric faults and asymmetric faults such as a double line to ground fault that applies in this system. This paper applies Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOM) to improve the LVRT capability and dynamic performance of an electrical grid linked to a Photovoltaic (PV)/Wind hybrid system through grid disturbances. A hybrid power system containing a PV station that produces 1\u00a0MW and a wind farm from type Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) that produces 9\u00a0MW is connected to STATCOM with 48 pulses at PCC bus and energized load. It compensates reactive power to improve LVRT that occurred due to fault. The applied STATCOM controller adjusts the voltage of the PCC bus during an occuring fault on the grid by compensating reactive power. STATCOM is controlled by a Proportional\u2013Integral\u2013Derivative (PID) and is compared with STATCOM controlled by Artificial Intelligence Control (AIC)-based on Proportional\u2014Integral Fuzzy Logic Control (PI FLC). The Lightning Attachment Procedure Optimization Algorithm (LAPO) optimization method is used to adjust the parameters of the PI controller to reduce error signals. A simulation model of the suggested hybrid power system has been performed using Matlab/Simulink.

            "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

We fabricate halide perovskite artificial synapses in\na back-contacted architecture to achieve microscale devices despite\nthe high solubility of halide perovskites in polar solvents that are\ncommonly used in lithography. The energy consumption of a conductance\nchange of the device is as low as 640 fJ, among the lowest reported\nfor two-terminal halide perovskite artificial synapses so far. Moreover,\nthe high resistance of the device up to hundreds of megaohms, low\noperating voltage of 100 mV and simple two-terminal architecture enable\nimplementation in highly dense crossbar arrays. These arrays could\npotentially show orders of magnitude lower energy consumption for\ncomputation compared to conventional digital computers."

This can have a substantial impact on their individual and social lives. Individual reports about life after stroke have improved our understanding of this impact. However, stroke support systems, struggling with increased demands due to a growing stroke population and guideline requirements, require deeper insights based on synthesised narratives into what can enable stroke survivors to rebuild their lives and identities positively to provide person-centred care. A qualitative study using Charmaz's Constructivist Grounded Theory (GT) method. Semi-structured interviews lasting 60\u201390\u2005min were conducted. These interviews were held at least 12 months post-stroke. Thirty participants were interviewed from across the UK (14 women, 16 men; aged 31\u201386; 1\u201325 years post-stroke). Participants reported the disruption stroke could cause to their sense of identity. The concept of liminality, that describes the ambiguous, transformative state between two distinct stages, where an individual or group exists \u201cbetwixt and between\u201d stable conditions, explains the challenge to identity post-stroke. Participants reported developing an uncertain sense of identity as they struggled to structure identity in the same way they did before stroke. This is because the participants' characteristics, traits, hobbies, or future life plans, as well as social relationships and roles, were affected by stroke. Subsequently, participants began a process of reconfiguring their identity, an often-long-term process that involved coming to terms with, and integrating, the impact of stroke on their lives. As a result, participants could enter an indefinite period of sustained liminality as they contend with long-term change and continued uncertainty. The concept of liminality, which emerged from individual stroke narratives for the first time, conveyed the adaptive and enduring nature of a stroke survivor's journey. Post-stroke liminality may continue indefinitely, sustained by a survivor's subjective individual and social situation. This new insight justifies the urgent call for long-term rehabilitation and support that is tailored towards the unique nature of a survivor's circumstances. Further work is required to understand how tailored, long-term and person-centred support can encourage survivors to positively reconfigure their identity.",

However, current research on these aspects among adolescent golfers with different handicaps remains limited. This study aimed to examine anthropometric and strength characteristics in adolescent golfers of differing handicaps and to explore their relationship with golf performance (handicap). This cross-sectional study recruited 40 adolescent golfers (25 males, 15 females) via convenience sampling, divided into low (n\u2009=\u200920) and high (n\u2009=\u200920) handicap groups. Sample size was determined by a priori power analysis. Anthropometric measures (height, shoulder width, hip, thigh, calf circumferences) and standardized strength tests (grip strength, medicine ball throws, standing long jump, countermovement jump) were assessed. Group differences were analyzed via independent t-tests, and correlations between handicap and strength metrics were analyzed using Pearson\u2019s correlation (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Golfers with low handicaps demonstrated significantly greater shoulder width (p\u2009=\u20090.033), hip, thigh, and calf circumferences (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and performed better in all strength tests (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Pearson correlation analysis indicated significant negative correlations between handicap and multiple strength metrics (r ranging from -0.324 to -0.556, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that strength variables explained approximately 60% of handicap variance. No gender comparisons were conducted. Anthropometric advantages and higher strength/explosive power are associated with better performance (lower handicap) in adolescent golfers. It is recommended that training programs for adolescent golfers emphasize strength and explosive power development to improve competitive performance.",

The research involved 557 nurses from public sector hospitals in Shandong Province, China. Data was collected between August and November 2024 and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings reveal that perceptions of the hospital working environment significantly affect nurses\u2019 technological support, nurses\u2019 organizational citizenship behaviors (NOCBO&I), and task-oriented performance. Additionally, authentic leadership is significantly correlated with perceptions of the hospital working environment, positively influencing technological support, task-oriented performance, and NOCBO&I. This study underscores the vital role of authentic leadership in moderating the profound impacts of the working environment, fostering a positive atmosphere in hospitals, and enhancing nurse productivity with the support of technology. The insights gained from this research provide valuable implications for nurse leaders seeking to improve hospital performance through effective leadership practices.

              "content": "In severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), sedatives are often used to control intracranial pressure (ICP), to reduce brain metabolism, to allow for other treatments such as mechanical ventilation or targeted temperature management, or to control paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\u00a0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\u00a0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\u00a0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\u00a0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points. This study is the first prospective RCT to investigate the safety of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in TBI patients.

In our preliminary studies, we found that Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture could improve neurological deficits and neuropathological damage in the perihematomal area in ICH rats.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture on oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis after ICH and the role of SIRT1/FOXO1 in acupuncture's neuroprotection.

Neurological deficits were evaluated using the modified neurological severity score (mNSS). Brain edema was evaluated using brain water content. HE staining and Nissl staining were used to evaluate neuropathological damage in the perihematomal area. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling was used to quantify neuronal apoptosis. Specific kits were used to detect the levels of SOD, CAT, GSH\u2010Px in the brain. The oxidative DNA damage was evaluated using enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay to detect the level of 8\u2010hydroxyguanosine (8\u2010OHdG). Western blot was used to evaluate the expressions of SIRT1, Ac\u2010FOXO1, FOXO1, Bcl\u20102, and Bax. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted to detect the cellular localization of SIRT1. Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture improved the neurological deficits and brain edema, reduced the pathological injury and neuronal degeneration in 3 days in the perihematomal area after ICH. Mechanistically, acupuncture reduced oxidative stress injury and neuronal apoptosis via activating SIRT1/FOXO1 pathway. The neuroprotective effects of acupuncture were abolished by injection of the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527. Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture could reduce oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, at least in part, through the SIRT1/FOXO1 signaling pathway, improving neurological deficits and neuropathological damage after ICH. These findings suggest that Baihui\u2010penetrating\u2010Qubin acupuncture is an effective therapy for ICH, as well as targeting SIRT1 signaling to promote neuron survival could be a potential therapeutic strategy.",

Compared to bacterial endocarditis, FE develops more slowly and insidiously, with nonspecific clinical manifestations, making diagnosis more challenging. Cases presenting with low back pain as the initial symptom are exceedingly rare, leading to a high risk of misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. A 61-year-old male was admitted due to recurrent low back pain accompanied by fever for 2 months. He had no history of invasive procedures or immunosuppressive therapy. The patient was diagnosed with FE. The patient underwent surgical treatment, during which the excrescence was removed, and mitral valve replacement was performed. Postoperatively, he received a full course of antifungal therapy. Postoperatively, the patient experienced relief from low back pain and was afebrile. He was discharged after completing antifungal treatment and, upon follow-up after 1 year, had no recurrence of low back pain. In this case, the patient initially presented with low back pain, which, despite the presence of fever and other signs of infection, did not readily suggest a cardiac etiology. This case highlights the importance of not being misled by superficial symptoms and underscores the need for comprehensive and accurate physical examinations and targeted investigations for proper diagnosis.",

Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is reported in 20% to 50% of PTC patients, mainly in the neck, and 20% originates from recurrence. LNM of papillary thyroid carcinoma are a plausible prognostic factor to determine disease recurrence. Currently, fine needle lymph node aspiration for cytology (LN\u2010FN\u2010cytology) is the best modality to diagnose LNM but is limited by diagnostic sensitivity and sample error. Fine needle lymph node aspiration for thyroglobulin measurement (LN\u2010FNA\u2010Tg) could offer a reliable and quantitative diagnostic method for LNM. The combination of LN\u2010FNA\u2010cytology and LN\u2010FNA\u2010Tg could achieve almost 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for LNM. Both treatment guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and European Thyroid Association recommend LN\u2010FNA\u2010Tg to diagnose LNM after total thyroidectomy. Diagnostic accuracy of the LN\u2010FNA\u2010Tg depends on optimal equipment, scanning protocol, skill, and experience of operators.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

If it is not addressed, the patient's function can be negatively affected. There is currently no specific tool for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI. Following surgery or injury to the knee, AMI causes defective activation of the quadriceps, sometimes combined with a knee extension deficit. A clinical classification of AMI has been proposed recently to help with making the diagnosis and to guide treatment. In this article, we describe how biofeedback and surface electromyography (EMG) can be used in the early diagnosis and treatment of knee AMI. Biofeedback is based on transformation of physiological variables into a visual or auditory signal. This allows the patient to learn how to control physical and bodily functions, which were previously considered as involuntary processes. This technique requires the use of a specific device that transforms the measured physiological signals\u2014neuromuscular activation in this instance\u2014into visual signals. This tool incorporates surface EMG, with electrodes connected to a measuring unit. This unit is connected to a screen that shows the neuromuscular activation in real time. Thus, EMG biofeedback can be used to help clinicians make a diagnosis and to specifically treat the AMI. We have used biofeedback in patients who have a knee injury or who have undergone knee surgery. Both the therapist and patient were able to objectively see the presence of AMI using the biofeedback device. For treatment, the therapist works with a patient by providing clear instructions and increasingly more challenging goals. We show examples of how patients were able to eliminate their AMI by using biofeedback. EMG biofeedback is a promising tool for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear and ACL reconstruction surgery. The next steps are to define thresholds and a rehabilitation protocol that will be used in a clinical trial.

To better quantify these persistent features, we designed the  L Ant E R n A participant\u2010driven mixed\u2010methods approach to develop a clinically valid questionnaire over three stages: (1) Item generation through semi\u2010structured interviews; (2) Repeated cognitive debriefing rounds to advance comprehensibility, relevance and comprehensiveness; (3) Psychometric survey to condense the most sensitive and valid questions. Analyses incorporated sensitivity testing with multiple internal and external validations.

              "content": "Altered protein homeostasis through proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins is a hallmark of many cancers. Ubiquitination, coordinated by E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, involves up to 40 E2-conjugating enzymes in humans to specify substrates and ubiquitin linkages. In a screen for E2 dependencies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 N (UBE2N) emerged as the top candidate. To investigate UBE2N\u2019s role in AML, we characterized an enzymatically defective mouse model of UBE2N, revealing UBE2N\u2019s requirement in AML without an impact on normal hematopoiesis. Unlike other E2s, which mediate lysine-48 (K48) polyubiquitination and degradation of proteins, UBE2N primarily synthesizes K63-linked chains, stabilizing or altering protein function. Proteomic analyses and a whole-genome CRISPR-activation screen in pharmacologically and genetically UBE2N-inhibited AML cells unveiled a network of UBE2N-regulated proteins, many of which are implicated in cancer. UBE2N inhibition reduced their protein levels, leading to increased K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation through the immunoproteasome and revealing UBE2N activity is enriched in immunoproteasome-positive AML. Furthermore, an interactome screen identified tripartite motif\u2013containing protein 21 (TRIM21) as the E3 ligase partnering with activated UBE2N in AML to modulate UBE2N-dependent proteostasis. In conclusion, UBE2N maintains proteostasis in AML by stabilizing target proteins through K63-linked ubiquitination and prevention of K48 ubiquitin\u2013mediated degradation by the immunoproteasome. Thus, inhibition of UBE2N catalytic function suppresses leukemic cells through selective degradation of critical proteins in immunoproteasome-positive AML.",
