In Ethiopia, Afar pastoralists migrate seasonally with their livestock in search for grazing and water areas. Livestock are also a source of infectious diseases that can spread into wildlife populations when pastoralists encroach into unfenced national parks. The interactions between pastoralists and national parks, as well as the subsequent impacts, remain insufficiently understood in Afar. Two structured questionnaire surveys were conducted in 2021, including 300 pastoralist households in seven woredas of Afar, and 58 staff from three national parks (Awash, Alidegi and Yangudi Rassa). They captured pastoralist movements and livestock diseases as well as the perception of national park staff regarding challenges resulting from pastoral encroachment into parks. Among the pastoralists, 74.7% migrated with their livestock for a mean 3.5\u00a0months per year, during which time, 90% of respondents reported contact with other livestock herds, and over 80% with wildlife. A third (34.2%) reported disease outbreaks in their village prior to migration. Pastoralists traveled long distances, crossing woreda, regional or national boundaries. All 58-park respondents reported pastoralists with livestock inside their park and their close contact with wildlife. Additionally, 69% reported the presence of domestic dogs. Wildlife displacement, habitat loss and dog attacks on wildlife were perceived as the main threat caused by the presence of pastoralists, whereas diseases were only mentioned by 15.5%. Overall, park staff showed poor disease knowledge. They reported poor disease surveillance and no disease response. Within pastoral contexts, improved collaboration between wildlife and livestock authorities regarding land use, disease awareness and surveillance is needed to balance the needs of both wildlife and pastoralist\u2019s livestock development and mitigate threats to wildlife habitats.",

These \u2018silent\u2019 infections camouflaged the actual incidence of the disease, leading to downward biases in the rates of transmission, disease prevalence, and fatality. These, in turn, had implications for how people and policymakers responded to changing infection prevalence. This paper posits that in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, a considerable number of SARS-CoV-2 infections spread through asymptomatic infected individuals who lacked economic incentives to test and isolate adequately. The decision to undertake testing and the subsequent possibility of isolation entails a calculus of benefits and costs for an individual. Given that the perceived net benefit of such actions is correlated with the observed risk of infection, the likelihood of an asymptomatic individual choosing to undergo testing increases with the existing infection prevalence rate. This behavior, in turn, influenced disease transmission and mortality dynamics. This study presents an analytical framework that integrates prevalence-dependent testing behavior into a traditional epidemiological model. The model\u2019s predictions provide critical policy insights. It reveals that failing to account for testing and isolation behavior results in underestimation of the infection propagation and fatality rates when reported disease prevalence is low, thereby, skewing the containment strategies in the initial and late stages of a pandemic. The findings underscore the necessity of enhancing testing capacity as a crucial countermeasure for future contagions like COVID-19.",

Previous research found that people with HD feel less adequately socially supported compared with individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). This study used the perspective of those offering support to infer whether people with HD view their support differently, or if there is a gap in support quality compared with those with OCD. The design was cross\u2010sectional, comparing those supporting OCD with those supporting HD. An online questionnaire was completed by 116 people offering support (POS) to people with these conditions. Support quality was measured using an adapted, proxy version of the Revised Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire. The research hypothesized that POS(HD) would not differ on support ratings compared with POS(OCD); or that POS(HD) would report comparatively lower ratings across support components. Secondary analysis investigated group differences in stigmatized attitudes and associative stigma; internalized stigma by virtue of having a connection to a stigmatized individual. POS(HD) rated their wish to support and the perceived success as significantly lower. Public stigma was rated more highly by POS(HD) relative to POS(OCD) and associative stigma felt more acutely by POS(HD). Motivation to support was significantly lower in the HD group with associative stigma a significant predictive factor. Further research involving dyads is needed to investigate what is causing this shortfall in support. Clinical research for HD interventions should also examine how involving POS could enhance treatment outcomes.",

Understanding these effects is essential for optimizing agricultural practices and enhancing crop productivity. To investigate the effects of sowing dates on biomass allocation and allometric growth, a field experiment was conducted with sequential sowings of Fagopyrum esculentum from April 12th to August 11th in 2018. Biomass measurements were taken across various plant organs, and corresponding allocation calculations were made. A detailed analysis of the allometric growth relationship involving organ biomass variations was performed. The study revealed that the accumulation and allocation of organ biomass in buckwheat were significantly impacted by the sowing dates. Delayed planting led to reduced vegetative growth and increased biomass allocation towards reproduction. Allometric parameters such as exponent, constant, and individual size of buckwheat were notably affected by delayed planting. Interestingly, the allometric exponents governing the relationships between reproductive vs. vegetative biomass and belowground vs. aboveground biomass exhibited varying trends across different sowing dates. Notably, late sowings resulted in significantly higher reproductive biomass compared to early and middle sowings. These findings highlight the nuanced relationship between plant size and reproductive biomass under different sowing dates, emphasizing the critical role of planting timing in shaping mature plant sizes and reproductive outcomes. The study underscores the importance of considering sowing dates in agricultural practices to optimize plant growth and productivity.",

This review presents a comprehensive analysis of recent developments in the preparation, functionalization, and application of these polysaccharide-based films for agricultural packaging. Emphasis is placed on emerging fabrication techniques, including electrospinning, extrusion, and layer-by-layer assembly, which have significantly enhanced the mechanical, barrier, and antimicrobial properties of these materials. Furthermore, the incorporation of active compounds such as antioxidants and antimicrobials has improved the performance and shelf-life of packaged goods. Despite notable advancements, key limitations such as moisture sensitivity, poor mechanical durability, and high production costs persist. Strategies including polymer blending, nanofiller incorporation, and surface modification are explored as potential solutions. The applicability of these films in packaging fruits, vegetables, dairy, grains, and meat products is also discussed. By assessing current progress and future prospects, this review underscores the importance of carbohydrate-based films in promoting sustainable agricultural packaging systems, reducing environmental impact through the advancement of circular bioeconomy principles and sustainable development.",

Our analysis is based on a weighted sample of 5,473 women from NFHS-4 and 5,103 women from NFHS-5. The study employs a two-stage estimation procedure using the Inverse Mills Ratio (IMR) framework to address potential biases in abortion reporting. In the second stage, we used a multinomial probit regression model to assess factors influencing post-abortion contraceptive use. Post-abortion contraceptive use increased from 49% in NFHS-4 to 57% in NFHS-5. Multinomial probit regression analysis revealed that gestational age of abortion was negatively associated with post-abortion contraceptive use, while factors such as having a son or prior contraceptive use increased the likelihood. Women who had abortions in private or non-health facilities were less likely to use post-abortion Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARC), compared to public health facilities. Those who reported unplanned pregnancy or contraceptive failure as the reason for abortion were more likely to use traditional methods of post-abortion contraception.

However, the substantial individual heterogeneity among patients poses a challenge to reaching a unified conclusion. To address this variability, our study adopts a novel framework to parse individualized ALFF abnormalities. We hypothesize that individualized ALFF abnormalities can be portrayed as a unique linear combination of shared differential factors. Our study involved two large multi-center datasets, comprising 2424 patients with MDD and 2183 healthy controls. In patients, individualized ALFF abnormalities were derived through normative modeling and further deconstructed into differential factors using non-negative matrix factorization. Two positive and two negative factors were identified. These factors were closely linked to clinical characteristics and explained group-level ALFF abnormalities in the two datasets. Moreover, these factors exhibited distinct associations with the distribution of neurotransmitter receptors/transporters, transcriptional profiles of inflammation-related genes, and connectome-informed epicenters, underscoring their neurobiological relevance. Additionally, factor compositions facilitated the identification of four distinct depressive subtypes, each characterized by unique abnormal ALFF patterns and clinical features. Importantly, these findings were successfully replicated in another dataset with different acquisition equipment, protocols, preprocessing strategies, and medication statuses, validating their robustness and generalizability. This research identifies shared differential factors underlying individual spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in MDD and contributes novel insights into the heterogeneity of spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in MDD.",

Following Hartmann's procedure for a sealed perforation, she developed diversion colitis. Subsequent symptoms included abdominal pain, vomiting, and high stoma output, with CT imaging revealing upstream colitis and para-stomal cellulitis. Biopsies confirmed severe inflammation and ulceration consistent with UC. The patient was treated with intravenous hydrocortisone, but her symptoms rebounded upon steroid tapering. Vedolizumab was considered due to her venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk. Post-treatment, her stoma output and skin irritation improved.

A 62-year-old man with the chief complaint of swelling of the anterior wall of the left external auditory canal underwent cystectomy at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology. Histopathological examination revealed a ganglion. Three months later, the swelling reappeared; computed tomography revealed an enlarged left temporomandibular head, which prompted the patient to visit our department. Subsequently, the ear canal was completely obstructed due to worsened swelling, and TMJ arthroplasty and ear canalplasty were performed. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well with no recurrence of swelling. Ganglions that arise as masses in the external auditory canal may be accompanied by osteoarthritis.",

In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

The induction of MOID depends on PML and DAXX mediating mitochondrial AIFM1-release. MAD2, TSG101, and AIF-PML-DAXX axis regulate mitochondria, PML nuclear bodies (NBs), and autophagy with close inter-dependent protein stability in survival cells. Loss of C-terminal phosphorylation(s) of TSG101 and closed (C-)MAD2-overexpression contribute to induce MOID. In survival cells, both MAD2 and TSG101 localize at PML NBs in interphase, and TSG101 Y390 phosphorylation is required for localization of TSG101 to PML NBs. PML release from PML NBs through PML deSUMOylation contributes to induce MOID.

              "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents a significant medical challenge due to its highly invasive nature, high rate of metastasis, and lack of drug-targetable receptors, which together lead to poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The traditional treatment guidelines for early TNBC are based on a multimodal approach integrating chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation and are associated with low overall survival and high relapse rates. Therefore, the approach to treating early TNBC has shifted towards neoadjuvant treatment (NAC), given to the patient before surgery and which aims to reduce tumour size, reduce the risk of recurrence, and improve the pathological complete response (pCR) rate. However, recent studies have shown that NAC is associated with only 30% of patients achieving pCR. Thus, novel predictive biomarkers are essential if treatment decisions are to be optimised and chemotherapy toxicities minimised. Given the heterogeneity of TNBC, mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies offer valuable tools for the discovery of targetable biomarkers for prognosis and prediction of toxicity. These biomarkers can serve as critical targets for therapeutic intervention. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of TNBC diagnosis and treatment, highlighting the need for a new approach. Specifically, it highlights how mass spectrometry-based can address key unmet clinical needs by identifying novel protein biomarkers to distinguish and early prognostication between TNBC patient groups who are being treated with NAC. By integrating proteomic insights, we anticipate enhanced treatment personalisation, improved clinical outcomes, and ultimately, increased survival rates for TNBC patients.",

A week before the experiment, scaling and oral health education were conducted to standardise the subjects\u2019 oral condition. For clinical evaluation, halitosis and HCB were evaluated pre-gargle (baseline), immediately after gargling (treatment), and 5 days after gargling (5 days post-treatment). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows. The level of subjective improvement was statistically significantly greater in the LCE group than the saline group (p < 0.05). Compared with the saline group, the LCE group showed reduced halitosis after 5 days of application. Furthermore, halitosis statistically significantly decreased over time (p < 0.05). Moreover, the LCE group showed a statistically significant decrease in the number of all six HCBs (p < 0.05). LCE gargle was effective in reducing halitosis both subjectively and objectively, suggesting an antibacterial effect on HCBs in the oral cavity. Thus, LCE, which can be used as a safe mouthwash ingredient, can promote oral health and will be valuable for the oral healthcare product industry. It might also be helpful for people suffering from halitosis.",

It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.",

Fifteen patients diagnosed with stage III/grade C periodontitis were included in the cohort. The right and left sides of the mouth were randomly assigned either the conventional SRP (control) group or the SRP supplemented with Nd:YAG laser group (experimental group, 160 mJ, 4 W) in a split-mouth design. Clinical periodontal indices were recorded at baseline and at the 6-week follow-up post-treatment. ELISA was utilised to measure IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in gingival crevicular fluid. The subgingival microbiota\u2019s composition and variations were characterised using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, while quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to analyse the changes in the red-complex bacteria in subgingival plaque. The SRP+Nd group exhibited a statistically significant reduction in record probing depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP) compared to the SRP group after treatment (p<0.05). The SRP+Nd group showed a markedly lower IL-1\u03b2 level than the SRP group (p<0.05). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in the dominant subgingival microbiota composition and level of the red-complex bacteria between the two groups (p>0.05). The adjunctive use of Nd:YAG laser with SRP demonstrates promising short-term therapeutic benefits for patients with extensive stage III/grade C periodontitis. Both SRP as a standalone treatment and its combination with Nd:YAG laser effectively facilitate a transition in the dominant bacterial community from periodontitis-associated to periodontal health-associated microbiota.",

Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.",

Changes in cardiovascular/metabolic-related parameters, physical manifestations of hypercortisolism, and quality of life (QoL) were evaluated across the following patient subgroups: both LNSC and mUFC controlled, only mUFC controlled, only LNSC controlled, and neither controlled. Of 160 patients included in the analysis, 85.0% had both LNSC and mUFC uncontrolled at baseline.

Among the pastoralists, 74.7% migrated with their livestock for a mean 3.5\u00a0months per year, during which time, 90% of respondents reported contact with other livestock herds, and over 80% with wildlife. A third (34.2%) reported disease outbreaks in their village prior to migration. Pastoralists traveled long distances, crossing woreda, regional or national boundaries. All 58-park respondents reported pastoralists with livestock inside their park and their close contact with wildlife. Additionally, 69% reported the presence of domestic dogs. Wildlife displacement, habitat loss and dog attacks on wildlife were perceived as the main threat caused by the presence of pastoralists, whereas diseases were only mentioned by 15.5%.

The use of osteotomies to correct malalignment and fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) to address cartilage lesions and patellofemoral dysplasia is a viable treatment option for carefully selected patients. The patient is a 22-year-old woman with medial patellar instability caused by iatrogenic distal femoral external rotation and uncontained grade IV patellofemoral lesions. The patient was indicated for OCA because the lesions were too large for an osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS) and were uncontained and not amenable to autologous chondrocyte implantation. Bipolar OCA also addresses the patient\u2019s patellofemoral dysplasia by restoring a more morphologically normal patellofemoral joint. The external rotation and mild varus deformity are corrected with a biplanar distal femoral osteotomy. Correction of malalignment is necessary prior to OCA transplantation to avoid abnormal graft loading and thereby decrease the risk of graft failure. (1) Diagnostic arthroscopy and fluoroscopic examination under anesthesia. (2) Lateral closing wedge de-rotational distal femoral osteotomy. (3) Bipolar OCA with tibial tubercle osteotomy and removal of hardware. In this case, the patient had significant improvement in her symptoms and had full knee range of motion with a normal gait at 3 months after surgery. Depending on a patient\u2019s preoperative function and the specific pathology, full recovery can take considerably longer. A successful outcome is considered return to activities of daily living without significant pain. Return to higher level athletic activities is significantly more unpredictable. Graft survival of bipolar patellofemoral OCA is variable, and the literature is limited by the small number of procedures performed, but published series range from 60% to 85% at 5 years. A successful outcome in these unique, complex cases depends on good patient selection, preoperative planning, and surgical execution. Patellar instability can be reliably treated when the predisposing anatomical factors are appropriately corrected. Bipolar OCA can provide significant improvement in pain and function, but continues to have the highest rate of graft failure compared with other sites within the knee, and should be considered a salvage operation for patients with significant limitations in activities of daily living.

            "Pastoralists and national parks are key stakeholders in the management and conservation of natural and protected habitats. In Ethiopia, Afar pastoralists migrate seasonally with their livestock in search for grazing and water areas. Livestock are also a source of infectious diseases that can spread into wildlife populations when pastoralists encroach into unfenced national parks. The interactions between pastoralists and national parks, as well as the subsequent impacts, remain insufficiently understood in Afar. Two structured questionnaire surveys were conducted in 2021, including 300 pastoralist households in seven woredas of Afar, and 58 staff from three national parks (Awash, Alidegi and Yangudi Rassa). They captured pastoralist movements and livestock diseases as well as the perception of national park staff regarding challenges resulting from pastoral encroachment into parks. Among the pastoralists, 74.7% migrated with their livestock for a mean 3.5\u00a0months per year, during which time, 90% of respondents reported contact with other livestock herds, and over 80% with wildlife. A third (34.2%) reported disease outbreaks in their village prior to migration. Pastoralists traveled long distances, crossing woreda, regional or national boundaries. All 58-park respondents reported pastoralists with livestock inside their park and their close contact with wildlife. Additionally, 69% reported the presence of domestic dogs. Wildlife displacement, habitat loss and dog attacks on wildlife were perceived as the main threat caused by the presence of pastoralists, whereas diseases were only mentioned by 15.5%. Overall, park staff showed poor disease knowledge. They reported poor disease surveillance and no disease response.

            "Patellar instability with symptomatic cartilage lesions in young patients is a challenging problem to treat. The use of osteotomies to correct malalignment and fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) to address cartilage lesions and patellofemoral dysplasia is a viable treatment option for carefully selected patients. The patient is a 22-year-old woman with medial patellar instability caused by iatrogenic distal femoral external rotation and uncontained grade IV patellofemoral lesions. The patient was indicated for OCA because the lesions were too large for an osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS) and were uncontained and not amenable to autologous chondrocyte implantation. Bipolar OCA also addresses the patient\u2019s patellofemoral dysplasia by restoring a more morphologically normal patellofemoral joint. The external rotation and mild varus deformity are corrected with a biplanar distal femoral osteotomy. Correction of malalignment is necessary prior to OCA transplantation to avoid abnormal graft loading and thereby decrease the risk of graft failure. (1) Diagnostic arthroscopy and fluoroscopic examination under anesthesia. (2) Lateral closing wedge de-rotational distal femoral osteotomy. (3) Bipolar OCA with tibial tubercle osteotomy and removal of hardware. In this case, the patient had significant improvement in her symptoms and had full knee range of motion with a normal gait at 3 months after surgery. Depending on a patient\u2019s preoperative function and the specific pathology, full recovery can take considerably longer. A successful outcome is considered return to activities of daily living without significant pain. Return to higher level athletic activities is significantly more unpredictable. Graft survival of bipolar patellofemoral OCA is variable, and the literature is limited by the small number of procedures performed, but published series range from 60% to 85% at 5 years. A successful outcome in these unique, complex cases depends on good patient selection, preoperative planning, and surgical execution. Patellar instability can be reliably treated when the predisposing anatomical factors are appropriately corrected. Bipolar OCA can provide significant improvement in pain and function, but continues to have the highest rate of graft failure compared with other sites within the knee, and should be considered a salvage operation for patients with significant limitations in activities of daily living.

The coastal areas of the atoll, a marine protected area, serve as important nursery habitats for many reef fish species. At the same time, the offshore deep-sea continental slopes are historically important fishing grounds. Although previous inventories primarily focused on coral reef fishes within the atoll listing 652 species from 73 families, comprehensive surveys of fishes from deeper waters have been incomplete. In this study, the species composition of the fish fauna around Dongsha was updated by analyzing large volumes of frozen bycatch from commercial deep-sea trawlers operating in the area for the past four years and reviewing the existing literature. The species list increased to 1087 species belonging to 167 families, including several documented as new records and potentially undescribed species.

These \u2018silent\u2019 infections camouflaged the actual incidence of the disease, leading to downward biases in the rates of transmission, disease prevalence, and fatality. These, in turn, had implications for how people and policymakers responded to changing infection prevalence. This paper posits that in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, a considerable number of SARS-CoV-2 infections spread through asymptomatic infected individuals who lacked economic incentives to test and isolate adequately. The decision to undertake testing and the subsequent possibility of isolation entails a calculus of benefits and costs for an individual. Given that the perceived net benefit of such actions is correlated with the observed risk of infection, the likelihood of an asymptomatic individual choosing to undergo testing increases with the existing infection prevalence rate. This behavior, in turn, influenced disease transmission and mortality dynamics. This study presents an analytical framework that integrates prevalence-dependent testing behavior into a traditional epidemiological model. The model\u2019s predictions provide critical policy insights. It reveals that failing to account for testing and isolation behavior results in underestimation of the infection propagation and fatality rates when reported disease prevalence is low, thereby, skewing the containment strategies in the initial and late stages of a pandemic. The findings underscore the necessity of enhancing testing capacity as a crucial countermeasure for future contagions like COVID-19.",

Previous research found that people with HD feel less adequately socially supported compared with individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). This study used the perspective of those offering support to infer whether people with HD view their support differently, or if there is a gap in support quality compared with those with OCD. The design was cross\u2010sectional, comparing those supporting OCD with those supporting HD. An online questionnaire was completed by 116 people offering support (POS) to people with these conditions. Support quality was measured using an adapted, proxy version of the Revised Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire. The research hypothesized that POS(HD) would not differ on support ratings compared with POS(OCD); or that POS(HD) would report comparatively lower ratings across support components. Secondary analysis investigated group differences in stigmatized attitudes and associative stigma; internalized stigma by virtue of having a connection to a stigmatized individual. POS(HD) rated their wish to support and the perceived success as significantly lower. Public stigma was rated more highly by POS(HD) relative to POS(OCD) and associative stigma felt more acutely by POS(HD). Motivation to support was significantly lower in the HD group with associative stigma a significant predictive factor. Further research involving dyads is needed to investigate what is causing this shortfall in support. Clinical research for HD interventions should also examine how involving POS could enhance treatment outcomes.",

Despite its importance, there is limited understanding of the determinants for the use of such evidence in planning processes, particularly in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) like Tanzania. This study aims to investigate the proportion and determinants that affect the use of health research evidence in health planning in Tanzania. This quantitative study employed a cross-sectional design. Data on health research evidence and the factors influencing its use were collected using a structured questionnaire from 422 healthcare workers involved in planning within 9 regions of Tanzania from October to December 2023. The association between categorical variables was assessed using a chi-square test, while regression analysis was conducted to identify determinants, both at a 95% confidence level, The study revealed that 270 (66.2%) of health planning team members strongly agreed that they use health research evidence during planning. Several key determinants were significantly associated with the level of research evidence utilization. These included limited dissemination of research findings (74.5%), inadequate human and non-human resources (70.0%), and insufficient knowledge and training in research (63.7%). A multivariate regression analysis confirmed significant associations between the determinants and the use of research evidence (p<0.05). Descriptive statistics revealed that over 70% of respondents identified the presence of research coordinators, partnerships with universities, availability of research budgets, and internet access as important factors in their research. Inferential analysis indicated that these factors were statistically significantly associated with the use of health research evidence. In addition, more than half of the participants stated motivational factors, such as the presence of continuous quality improvement initiatives, the availability of short- and long-term training programs, on-the-job training opportunities, and incentives like extra duty allowances, as contributors to the enhanced use of research evidence. \n Bottom of Form The study found that planning team members used health research evidence in planning, but several determinants, such as lack of dissemination, resource shortages, and inadequate training, persisted.

Multivariable regression models with interaction were used to assess the association between the time since the last dental appointment and clinical oral health outcomes among routine and urgent users separately. Two-thirds of the US population had a dental appointment within a year, while nearly 44 million individuals did not visit a dentist for the last three years. The odds of having teeth with untreated coronal or root caries increased with the length of time since the last appointment, and urgent users had worse dental outcomes compared to routine users.

Daily and occasional lifetime cannabis use were associated with decreased odds of SI (OR = 0.605, CI 0.368\u20130.997 and OR = 0.646, CI 0.457\u20130.913 respectively) and JTC bias (OR = 0.625, CI 0.422\u20130.925 and OR = 0.602, CI 0.460\u20130.787 respectively) compared with lifetime abstinence, but not with FRP deficits, in the whole sample. Within the cannabis user group, low-potency cannabis use was associated with increased odds of SI (OR = 1.829, CI 1.297\u20132.578, FRP deficits (OR = 1.393, CI 1.031\u20131.882, and JTC (OR = 1.661, CI 1.271\u20132.171) relative to high-potency cannabis use, with comparable effects in the three clinical groups. Our findings suggest increased odds of cognitive biases in FEP patients who have never used cannabis and in low-potency users. Future studies should elucidate this association and its potential implications.",

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05.

            "Evidence from clinical research suggests that in the first two waves of COVID-19, the virus spread rapidly through a large number of undocumented asymptomatic infections. These \u2018silent\u2019 infections camouflaged the actual incidence of the disease, leading to downward biases in the rates of transmission, disease prevalence, and fatality. These, in turn, had implications for how people and policymakers responded to changing infection prevalence. This paper posits that in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, a considerable number of SARS-CoV-2 infections spread through asymptomatic infected individuals who lacked economic incentives to test and isolate adequately. The decision to undertake testing and the subsequent possibility of isolation entails a calculus of benefits and costs for an individual. Given that the perceived net benefit of such actions is correlated with the observed risk of infection, the likelihood of an asymptomatic individual choosing to undergo testing increases with the existing infection prevalence rate. This behavior, in turn, influenced disease transmission and mortality dynamics. This study presents an analytical framework that integrates prevalence-dependent testing behavior into a traditional epidemiological model. The model\u2019s predictions provide critical policy insights. It reveals that failing to account for testing and isolation behavior results in underestimation of the infection propagation and fatality rates when reported disease prevalence is low, thereby, skewing the containment strategies in the initial and late stages of a pandemic. The findings underscore the necessity of enhancing testing capacity as a crucial countermeasure for future contagions like COVID-19.",
            "Hoarding difficulties (HD) affect many people and cause upset and danger for the person, as well as friends and family. Previous research found that people with HD feel less adequately socially supported compared with individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). This study used the perspective of those offering support to infer whether people with HD view their support differently, or if there is a gap in support quality compared with those with OCD. The design was cross\u2010sectional, comparing those supporting OCD with those supporting HD. An online questionnaire was completed by 116 people offering support (POS) to people with these conditions. Support quality was measured using an adapted, proxy version of the Revised Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire. The research hypothesized that POS(HD) would not differ on support ratings compared with POS(OCD); or that POS(HD) would report comparatively lower ratings across support components. Secondary analysis investigated group differences in stigmatized attitudes and associative stigma; internalized stigma by virtue of having a connection to a stigmatized individual. POS(HD) rated their wish to support and the perceived success as significantly lower. Public stigma was rated more highly by POS(HD) relative to POS(OCD) and associative stigma felt more acutely by POS(HD). Motivation to support was significantly lower in the HD group with associative stigma a significant predictive factor. Further research involving dyads is needed to investigate what is causing this shortfall in support. Clinical research for HD interventions should also examine how involving POS could enhance treatment outcomes.",

A total of 314 patients were identified for follow-up appointments. Based on their responses, participants were categorised into four groups: attendees, non-attendees, refusals, and unreachable. Furthermore, data on sociodemographic factors (age, sex, nationality, marital status, education, occupation, and residential area), medical history, dental history (including missing teeth, implants, or orthodontic treatment history), and past appointment attendance (average yearly appointments, missed appointment percentage, and last appointment date) were collected and analysed to understand their influence on patient compliance. In a sample of 314 patients, 102 (32.5%) attended the appointments successfully. Improved attendance rates were significantly associated with being female, Saudi Arabian, married, and employed (p < 0.05). Moreover, patients with a high frequency of annual appointments and a recent history of appointments exhibited better compliance. None of the analysed dental factors affected the attendance rates. About one-third of patients who had undergone crown lengthening surgery were compliant with the follow-up visits. Different factors influenced this compliance pattern to varying extents, with more efforts needed to enhance patients\u2019 commitment to these visits.",
            "The use of health research evidence is essential for informed decision-making and effective health planning. Despite its importance, there is limited understanding of the determinants for the use of such evidence in planning processes, particularly in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) like Tanzania. This study aims to investigate the proportion and determinants that affect the use of health research evidence in health planning in Tanzania. This quantitative study employed a cross-sectional design. Data on health research evidence and the factors influencing its use were collected using a structured questionnaire from 422 healthcare workers involved in planning within 9 regions of Tanzania from October to December 2023. The association between categorical variables was assessed using a chi-square test, while regression analysis was conducted to identify determinants, both at a 95% confidence level, The study revealed that 270 (66.2%) of health planning team members strongly agreed that they use health research evidence during planning. Several key determinants were significantly associated with the level of research evidence utilization. These included limited dissemination of research findings (74.5%), inadequate human and non-human resources (70.0%), and insufficient knowledge and training in research (63.7%). A multivariate regression analysis confirmed significant associations between the determinants and the use of research evidence (p<0.05). Descriptive statistics revealed that over 70% of respondents identified the presence of research coordinators, partnerships with universities, availability of research budgets, and internet access as important factors in their research. Inferential analysis indicated that these factors were statistically significantly associated with the use of health research evidence. In addition, more than half of the participants stated motivational factors, such as the presence of continuous quality improvement initiatives, the availability of short- and long-term training programs, on-the-job training opportunities, and incentives like extra duty allowances, as contributors to the enhanced use of research evidence. \n Bottom of Form The study found that planning team members used health research evidence in planning, but several determinants, such as lack of dissemination, resource shortages, and inadequate training, persisted. Interventions should focus on improving dissemination, resources, and training. Future research should explore strategies for enhancing these interventions.",

This study aims to investigate the causal relationships of sleep apnea on prostatitis using Mendelian randomization (MR). Summary-level data for sleep apnea (16,761 cases and 201,194 controls) and prostatitis (1859 cases and 72,799 controls) were available from the GWAS summary data. Two-sample MR analyses were performed to investigate the causal relationship between sleep apnea and prostatitis. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis was employed as the primary statistical method. In 2-sample MR analyses, we found that IVW estimates revealed that sleep apnea inferred an effect on risk of prostatitis at statistical significance (odds ratio [OR]\u2005=\u20051.370, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2005=\u20050.094\u20130.535,  P",

We used data from the 2017\u20132020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a cross-sectional, nationally-representative survey of noninstitutionalized US adults. The predictors were the time since and the reason for the last dental appointment (routine vs. urgent). We examined the presence and number of missing teeth and teeth with untreated coronal and root caries. Multivariable regression models with interaction were used to assess the association between the time since the last dental appointment and clinical oral health outcomes among routine and urgent users separately. Two-thirds of the US population had a dental appointment within a year, while nearly 44 million individuals did not visit a dentist for the last three years. The odds of having teeth with untreated coronal or root caries increased with the length of time since the last appointment, and urgent users had worse dental outcomes compared to routine users. Compared to those who had a dental appointment within a year, individuals who had their last dental appointment more than 3 years ago had 2.94 times the average number of teeth with untreated caries among routine users (95%CI=2.39, 3.62) and 1.60 times the average among urgent users (95%CI=1.05, 2.43). Recent, routine dental appointments are associated with improved oral health outcomes.

Understanding these effects is essential for optimizing agricultural practices and enhancing crop productivity. To investigate the effects of sowing dates on biomass allocation and allometric growth, a field experiment was conducted with sequential sowings of Fagopyrum esculentum from April 12th to August 11th in 2018. Biomass measurements were taken across various plant organs, and corresponding allocation calculations were made. A detailed analysis of the allometric growth relationship involving organ biomass variations was performed. The study revealed that the accumulation and allocation of organ biomass in buckwheat were significantly impacted by the sowing dates. Delayed planting led to reduced vegetative growth and increased biomass allocation towards reproduction. Allometric parameters such as exponent, constant, and individual size of buckwheat were notably affected by delayed planting. Interestingly, the allometric exponents governing the relationships between reproductive vs. vegetative biomass and belowground vs. aboveground biomass exhibited varying trends across different sowing dates. Notably, late sowings resulted in significantly higher reproductive biomass compared to early and middle sowings. These findings highlight the nuanced relationship between plant size and reproductive biomass under different sowing dates, emphasizing the critical role of planting timing in shaping mature plant sizes and reproductive outcomes.

A cross-sectional study involving 2746 children 3 to 5 years of age was conducted in Sichuan province. Children were examined for dmft index, and sociodemographic and behavioural factors were acquried through a questionnaire completed by their caregivers. A prediction model was developed by backward multivariate logistic regression, and its overfitting degree was examined with 5-fold cross-validation. A simple risk-score model was derived to screen the children with dmft > 2 at high risk of caries with the \u03b2 regression coefficient obtained from the multivariate regression model. A child\u2019s oral health status was identified as the highest risk indicator with a \u03b2 regression coefficient of 1.093. The mean area under curve (AUC) from the 5-fold cross-validation was 0.7408 (95% CI: 72.21%, 75.95%), with a bias of only ca 1%. This result allowed us to eliminate substantial overfitting of the prediction model. The AUC of the risk scoring system was 0.7455 (95% CI: 72.70%, 76.40%), which indicated good screenability. This risk score model has the advantages of simplicity, low cost and relatively high accuracy, and is suitable for use in developing countries, especially for primary screening for high risk of caries.

However, conventional grain storage methods frequently impede the ability to promptly and accurately predict and assess quality changes.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dual model system of \u201cprediction-evaluation\u201d, which integrates a dynamic quality prediction model based on SGCNiFormer with an evaluation framework based on K-Smeans clustering to establish a closed-loop mechanism from quality prediction to storage effect evaluation. The system incorporates a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a dynamic gating module, enabling precise simulation of the multidimensional evolution of wheat quality under the interaction of moisture and temperature. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SGCNiFormer in time-series prediction tasks, while the K-Smeans method establishes a wheat quality grading standard with physical interpretability. This integrated method provides a systematic theoretical framework for optimizing storage parameters and offers substantial support for intelligent grain storage management.",

Understanding these effects is essential for optimizing agricultural practices and enhancing crop productivity. To investigate the effects of sowing dates on biomass allocation and allometric growth, a field experiment was conducted with sequential sowings of Fagopyrum esculentum from April 12th to August 11th in 2018. Biomass measurements were taken across various plant organs, and corresponding allocation calculations were made. A detailed analysis of the allometric growth relationship involving organ biomass variations was performed. The study revealed that the accumulation and allocation of organ biomass in buckwheat were significantly impacted by the sowing dates.

Specifically, we observed purifying selection of prolongevity genes and relaxed selection of antilongevity genes within the IIS/TOR pathway in species that have lost prepupal diapause. Changes in selection pressures on this pathway may lead to the evolution of new phenotypes, such as lifespan extension and altered responses to nutritional signals that are crucial for social evolution.",
            "To explore potential caries risk indicators in 3- to 5-year-old children, and develop a simple risk-score model to screen the children at high risk of caries with decayed, filled, and missing teeth (dmft) > 2. A cross-sectional study involving 2746 children 3 to 5 years of age was conducted in Sichuan province. Children were examined for dmft index, and sociodemographic and behavioural factors were acquried through a questionnaire completed by their caregivers. A prediction model was developed by backward multivariate logistic regression, and its overfitting degree was examined with 5-fold cross-validation. A simple risk-score model was derived to screen the children with dmft > 2 at high risk of caries with the \u03b2 regression coefficient obtained from the multivariate regression model. A child\u2019s oral health status was identified as the highest risk indicator with a \u03b2 regression coefficient of 1.093. The mean area under curve (AUC) from the 5-fold cross-validation was 0.7408 (95% CI: 72.21%, 75.95%), with a bias of only ca 1%. This result allowed us to eliminate substantial overfitting of the prediction model. The AUC of the risk scoring system was 0.7455 (95% CI: 72.70%, 76.40%), which indicated good screenability. This risk score model has the advantages of simplicity, low cost and relatively high accuracy, and is suitable for use in developing countries, especially for primary screening for high risk of caries. It shows that certain child behaviours and parental attitude play an important role in dental caries among preschool children.",
            "To assess factors related to the prevalence of dental caries among adolescent schoolchildren attending marginalised schools in the West Bank area of Palestine. A cross-sectional study was conducted in schools participating in the School Support Program (SSP). Fifty schools identified as marginalised by the SSP were stratified by district, student gender and grade level to select a random sample of 20 schools. Students in the 6th and 9th grades were screened by senior dental students to collect data about their weight, height, gingival health and caries experience. In addition, a structured in-person questionnaire was used to collect data about students\u2019 oral hygiene practices, dietary habits, mother\u2019s education and father\u2019s employment. In total, 1282 students completed interviews and clinical screenings. The mean number of Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT) was 6.4 \u00b1 4.4. Sixty-four percent had moderate gingivitis and 73% had fair oral hygiene. \u2018Recent visit to the dentist\u2019 was associated with mother\u2019s level of education (X This study indicates that Palestinian adolescents in marginalised governmental schools suffer the highest burden of dental disease and are disproportionally impacted when compared to other same-age students in the region.

            "Obesity and dental caries constitute an important public health problem worldwide. Special-needs children are at higher risk of developing dental caries and obesity because of their physical, neurological, or behavioural impairment or due to side effects of the medications they take. The present study was conducted to assess the association between dental caries and obesity among children with special health care needs in Taif City, Saudi Arabia. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 400 (220 girls and 180 boys) special-needs children. Body mass index (BMI) was determined by using height and weight measurements. Dental caries was recorded according to World Health Organization criteria. The association between caries and obesity was assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. 289 (72.3%) children presented with caries with mean dmft and DMFT of 3.9 \u00b1 2.7 and 4.8 \u00b1 2.3, respectively. Regression analysis showed specials needs children were at a greater risk of having dental caries: 1.69 times (CI: 0.18\u20132.62, p < 0.05) greater with obesity; 2.01 (CI: 0.18\u20133.09, p < 0.05) times greater with sugar consumption; 2.21 times (CI: 1.27\u20134.12, p < 0.001) greater with cerebral palsy; and 2.27 (CI: 1.29\u20135.12, p < 0.001) times greater with intellectual disability. The present study showed a positive association between dental caries and obesity among children of special health care needs. Hence, a focused approach towards the common risk factors is essential to prevent both obesity and dental caries in special-needs children.",

            "Wheat is a vital staple food crop, and its post-harvest storage is paramount to maintaining its quality. However, conventional grain storage methods frequently impede the ability to promptly and accurately predict and assess quality changes. Moreover, most storage systems are ineffective in dealing with the impact of temperature and humidity fluctuations on wheat quality, which can potentially lead to quality degradation during storage. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dual model system of \u201cprediction-evaluation\u201d, which integrates a dynamic quality prediction model based on SGCNiFormer with an evaluation framework based on K-Smeans clustering to establish a closed-loop mechanism from quality prediction to storage effect evaluation. The system incorporates a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a dynamic gating module, enabling precise simulation of the multidimensional evolution of wheat quality under the interaction of moisture and temperature. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SGCNiFormer in time-series prediction tasks, while the K-Smeans method establishes a wheat quality grading standard with physical interpretability. This integrated method provides a systematic theoretical framework for optimizing storage parameters and offers substantial support for intelligent grain storage management.",
            "Global crop yield has been affected by a number of abiotic stresses. Heat, salinity, and drought stress are at the top of the list as serious environmental growth-limiting factors. To enhance crop productivity, molecular approaches have been used to determine the key regulators affecting stress-related phenomena. MYB transcription factors (TF) have been reported as one of the promising defensive proteins against the unfavorable conditions that plants must face. Different roles of MYB TFs have been suggested such as regulation of cellular growth and differentiation, hormonal signaling, mediating abiotic stress responses, etc. To gain significant insights, a comprehensive in-silico analysis of OsMYB TF was carried out in comparison with 21 dicot MYB TFs and 10 monocot MYB TFs. Their chromosomal location, gene structure, protein domain, and motifs were analyzed. The phylogenetic relationship was also studied, which resulted in the classification of proteins into four basic groups: groups A, B, C, and D. The protein motif analysis identified several conserved sequences responsible for cellular activities. The gene structure analysis suggested that proteins that were present in the same class, showed similar intron-exon structures. Promoter analysis revealed major cis-acting elements that were found to be responsible for hormonal signaling and initiating a response to abiotic stress and light-induced mechanisms. The transformation of OsMYB TF into tobacco was carried out using the  Agrobacterium",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the salivary levels of caspase-1 and TNF-\u03b1 and determine their accuracy in differentiating periodontitis patients from individuals with a healthy periodontium. This case-control study enrolled 90 subjects, aged 30 to 55, attending the Department of Periodontics at Baghdad\u2019s outpatient clinic. Patients were initially screened to evaluate their eligibility for recruitment. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, subjects with a healthy periodontium were included in group 1 (controls), while subjects with periodontitis were included in group 2 (patients). The salivary levels of caspase-1 and TNF-\u03b1 in participants\u2019 unstimulated saliva were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then the periodontal status was determined using the following indices: full-mouth plaque, full-mouth bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and gingival recession. TNF-\u03b1 and caspase-1 salivary levels were higher in periodontitis patients than in healthy controls and were positively correlated with all clinical parameters. A positive significant correlation between TNF-\u03b1 and caspase-1 salivary levels was noticed. For differentiating periodontal health and periodontitis, the area under the curve (AUC) values of TNF-\u03b1 and caspase-1 were 0.978 and 0.998, while the proposed cut-off points were 128.163 pg/ml and 1.626 ng/ml, respectively. The present findings supported a previous discovery that periodontitis patients have significantly higher levels of salivary TNF-\u03b1. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the salivary levels of TNF-\u03b1 and caspase-1. Furthermore, caspase-1 and TNF-\u03b1 showed high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of periodontitis, as well as distinguishing periodontitis from periodontal health.",

            "To explore the relationship between of self-reported health (SRH) and educational attainment with past-year dental visits in older adults in M\u00e9xico. For this cross-sectional study, data were derived from the Mexican Health and Aging Study 2018 (MHAS-2018), which used a nationally-representative sample of older adults (50 years or older) in Mexico (n = 14,085). Variables taken from the MHAS questionnaire included residence (rural/urban), years of education, SRH, multimorbidity, pain severity, and past-year dental visits. A logistic regression model was used to identify the association between the variables and past-year dental visits. While the percentage of past-year dental visits reported was 39.8%, this number declined with age [OR=0.76, p < 0.001], with older adults living in rural areas 34% less likely to report past-year dental visits than older adults living in urban areas. Older adults with no formal education were 73% less likely (OR=0.27; p < 0.001) to report past-year dental visits than older adults \u226510 years education. Older adults with poor SRH were 32% less likely (OR=0.68; p < 0.001) to report past-year dental visits than older adults with good/very good/excellent SRH.

Data from 23,246 adults aged \u2265 19 years, who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2016 to 2019, were considered for our analyses. Participants with either masticatory or speech problems were defined as the oral health problems group. Individuals who reported having had dental treatment in the last year were defined as the dental treatment group. We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The proportions of oral health problems and dental treatment were higher in participants with multimorbidity than in those without multimorbidity (all p < 0.001). Moreover, ORs of oral health problems demonstrated a tendency to increase with the number of chronic diseases, even after adjustment (p for trend < 0.001). Compared to the participants without multimorbidity, the risk of having oral health problems increased by 25% (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.12\u20131.39), and that of receiving dental treatment increased by 23% (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.13\u20131.34) in patients with multimorbidity.

            "Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) and interleukin 1-beta (IL-1\u03b2) are inflammatory biomarkers, whereas galectin-1 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. The relationship between suPAR, galactin-1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels in peri-implant sulcular fluid (PISF) in relation to dental implants remains unaddressed. The aim was to assess suPAR, galectin-1, and IL-1\u03b2 levels in PISF under peri-implant inflammatory conditions. Demographic data and information related to jaw location and duration of implants in function as well as systemic health was retrieved from patients\u2019 dental records. Peri-implant plaque and gingival indices (PI and GI, respectively), probing depth (PD) and crestal bone loss (CBL) were recorded. The PISF was collected and levels of suPAR, galectin-1 and IL-1\u03b2 were determined using standard techniques. Sample-size estimation and statistical analyses were done. Correlation of suPAR and galectin-1 with IL-1\u03b2 were assessed via logistic regression. p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Seventy-two patients (45 males and 27 females) with peri-implant diseases were included. Thirty-six patients (22 males and 14 females) had peri-implant mucositis; 36 (23 males and 13 females) had healthy peri-implant tissues. The PISF volume was statistically significantly higher among patients with (0.52 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b5l) than without peri-implant diseases (0.06 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b5l) (p < 0.001). The PISF levels of suPAR (p < 0.01), galectin-1 (p < 0.01) and IL-1\u03b2 (p < 0.01) were statistically significantly higher among patients with than without peri-implant diseases. In patients with peri-implant mucositis, PISF suPAR (p < 0.001) and galectin-1 (p < 0.001) levels correlated with PISF IL-1\u03b2 levels. In patients with peri-implant mucositis, increasing peri-implant PD and IL-1\u03b2 levels directly correlated with increased PISF suPAR (p < 0.001) and galectin-1 (p < 0.05) levels. Increased PISF levels of suPAR, galectin and IL-1\u03b2 suggest that these proteins possibly contribute towards the pathogenesis of peri-implant inflammation, and are potential biomarkers of peri-implant diseases."

In this study, we will investigate the relevant research progress of Irisin\u2019s protective role in traumatic brain injury (TBI) in recent years in terms of attenuating oxidative stress, inhibiting pyroptosis, suppressing inflammatory response, and improving autophagy, with the aim of providing valuable references for the diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Utilize bioinformatics analysis to study the interactions between genes in TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury). Construct a TBI mouse model to observe the effects of Irisin on TBI. The Morris water maze test is used to assess the learning and spatial memory abilities of mice, TUNEL fluorescence is used to detect cell apoptosis, Nissl staining is employed to observe the survival of hippocampal neurons in mice, and HE staining is used to observe the extent of brain injury in mice. Western blot is used to detect protein expression in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Q-PCR is employed to detect the levels of proteins related to autophagy/pyroptosis/inflammation. Irisin promotes MerTK overexpression by enhancing AMPK activation. Irisin can increase the expression of LC3I and Beclin-1 proteins, indicating the promotion of autophagic response. Additionally, Irisin reduces ROS levels and decreases SYK expression, thereby inhibiting the inflammatory response. Irisin improves the learning and spatial memory abilities of TBI mice and reduces cell apoptosis, as well as decreases hippocampal neuron death. HE staining shows that the brain injury in mice treated with Irisin is significantly alleviated. Irisin can enhance the expression of phosphorylated AMPK and phosphorylated MerTK proteins, promote autophagic response, and inhibit pyroptosis/inflammatory response. Correction experiments confirmed that after stimulation with an AMPK agonist, the expression of phosphorylated MerTK protein is significantly increased, autophagic response is enhanced, and pyroptosis/inflammatory response is weakened. When treated with a MerTK inhibitor during AMPK agonist stimulation, the autophagic response is weakened while pyroptosis/inflammatory response is enhanced. Irisin can inhibit the progression of traumatic brain injury by regulating AMPK/MerTK/autophagy and SYK/ROS/inflammatory signaling.

            "Irisin is a hormone-like peptide secreted by muscle tissues and generated by hydrolysis of type III fibronectin domain-containing protein 5 by proteolytic hydrolases. Whether Irisin has a potential protective role in traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, we will investigate the relevant research progress of Irisin\u2019s protective role in traumatic brain injury (TBI) in recent years in terms of attenuating oxidative stress, inhibiting pyroptosis, suppressing inflammatory response, and improving autophagy, with the aim of providing valuable references for the diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Utilize bioinformatics analysis to study the interactions between genes in TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury). Construct a TBI mouse model to observe the effects of Irisin on TBI. The Morris water maze test is used to assess the learning and spatial memory abilities of mice, TUNEL fluorescence is used to detect cell apoptosis, Nissl staining is employed to observe the survival of hippocampal neurons in mice, and HE staining is used to observe the extent of brain injury in mice. Western blot is used to detect protein expression in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Q-PCR is employed to detect the levels of proteins related to autophagy/pyroptosis/inflammation. Irisin promotes MerTK overexpression by enhancing AMPK activation. Irisin can increase the expression of LC3I and Beclin-1 proteins, indicating the promotion of autophagic response. Additionally, Irisin reduces ROS levels and decreases SYK expression, thereby inhibiting the inflammatory response. Irisin improves the learning and spatial memory abilities of TBI mice and reduces cell apoptosis, as well as decreases hippocampal neuron death. HE staining shows that the brain injury in mice treated with Irisin is significantly alleviated. Irisin can enhance the expression of phosphorylated AMPK and phosphorylated MerTK proteins, promote autophagic response, and inhibit pyroptosis/inflammatory response. Correction experiments confirmed that after stimulation with an AMPK agonist, the expression of phosphorylated MerTK protein is significantly increased, autophagic response is enhanced, and pyroptosis/inflammatory response is weakened. When treated with a MerTK inhibitor during AMPK agonist stimulation, the autophagic response is weakened while pyroptosis/inflammatory response is enhanced. Irisin can inhibit the progression of traumatic brain injury by regulating AMPK/MerTK/autophagy and SYK/ROS/inflammatory signaling.

            "Ovarian cancer (OV) is a common malignancy in the female reproductive system, characterized by poor prognosis and high recurrence rates. The discovery of dependable molecular markers is crucial for improving the timeliness of detection, diagnosis, and treatment, ultimately aiming to lower fatality rates. CNNM4 (cyclin and CBS domain divalent metal cation transport mediator 4), a member of the CNNM (Cyclin M) family, binds to PRL (prolactin) to regulate magnesium homeostasis and influence tumor cell proliferation. Although CNNM4 is implicated in various cancers, its role in OV remains unclear. \n In vitro Elevated levels of CNNM4 expression were observed in OV cells and tissues, and were linked to a poor prognosis. CNNM4 could modulate the proliferation and migration of various OV cell lines, including IOSE-80, SKOV-3, and A2780. Through involvement in multiple signaling pathways, evidenced by GSVA and GSEA, CNNM4 was implicated in OV progression. CNNM4 positively regulated the infiltration level of Macrophages M2, T cells CD4 memory resting and NK cells resting, and had a negative regulation effect on NK cells activated and T cells gamma delta. Moreover, CNNM4 is related to drug sensitivity of OV. A prediction model based on CNNM4 expression and clinical symptoms was constructed to predict OV prognosis. CNNM4 may affect the progression of OV and is associated with a poor prognosis. It has potential as a biomarker for predicting survival and as a target for therapeutic interventions in OV patients.",

Derived from renewable polysaccharides such as starch, cellulose, chitosan, pectin, alginate, pullulan, and xanthan gum, these films exhibit favorable biodegradability, film-forming ability, and compatibility with food systems. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of recent developments in the preparation, functionalization, and application of these polysaccharide-based films for agricultural packaging. Emphasis is placed on emerging fabrication techniques, including electrospinning, extrusion, and layer-by-layer assembly, which have significantly enhanced the mechanical, barrier, and antimicrobial properties of these materials. Furthermore, the incorporation of active compounds such as antioxidants and antimicrobials has improved the performance and shelf-life of packaged goods. Despite notable advancements, key limitations such as moisture sensitivity, poor mechanical durability, and high production costs persist. Strategies including polymer blending, nanofiller incorporation, and surface modification are explored as potential solutions. The applicability of these films in packaging fruits, vegetables, dairy, grains, and meat products is also discussed. By assessing current progress and future prospects, this review underscores the importance of carbohydrate-based films in promoting sustainable agricultural packaging systems, reducing environmental impact through the advancement of circular bioeconomy principles and sustainable development.",

Our analysis is based on a weighted sample of 5,473 women from NFHS-4 and 5,103 women from NFHS-5. The study employs a two-stage estimation procedure using the Inverse Mills Ratio (IMR) framework to address potential biases in abortion reporting. In the second stage, we used a multinomial probit regression model to assess factors influencing post-abortion contraceptive use. Post-abortion contraceptive use increased from 49% in NFHS-4 to 57% in NFHS-5. Multinomial probit regression analysis revealed that gestational age of abortion was negatively associated with post-abortion contraceptive use, while factors such as having a son or prior contraceptive use increased the likelihood. Women who had abortions in private or non-health facilities were less likely to use post-abortion Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARC), compared to public health facilities. Those who reported unplanned pregnancy or contraceptive failure as the reason for abortion were more likely to use traditional methods of post-abortion contraception.

The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (\u0394scales), OCT (\u0394retinal thickness), PERG (\u0394PERG values) and VEP (\u0394P100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral \u0394N95 latencies for PERG and \u0394P100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT.

Virtual reality (VR) technology offers a promising alternative, especially with real-life 360-degree video, which can recreate immersive clinical experiences. This study investigates whether real-life 360-degree VR can enhance medical students' interest in neurosurgery and serve as an effective educational tool. Methods:\u00a0A VR-based educational program was developed using 360-degree video footage captured with Insta360 Pro cameras installed in the emergency department, operating room, and angiography suite. The content was incorporated into a neurosurgical clinical training course for 85 fifth-year medical students at the International University of Health and Welfare Narita Hospital in Narita, Japan. Students viewed the VR content through synchronized head-mounted displays. After the session, an anonymous questionnaire assessed usability, immersion, comprehension, enjoyment, and interest in neurosurgery. A paired samples t-test was used to compare students' interest in neurosurgery before and after the session. Results:\u00a0High levels of satisfaction were reported with regard to usability (95%) and immersion (97.6%). Most students agreed that the VR session improved their understanding (92.9%) and was enjoyable (95%). Interest in neurosurgery increased significantly following the session, with affirmative responses rising from 22 (26%) to 52 (61%) students (t=6.77; df=84; p<0.0001). Conclusion: Real-life 360-degree VR is an effective supplementary tool for neurosurgical education. It offers immersive experiences that can enhance student engagement, understanding, and interest in neurosurgery. Broader implementation of this technology may address declining interest in the specialty and enrich clinical education.",

Despite global efforts to reduce their prevalence, follow\u2010up studies are needed to see if the measures are successful. Since most infants in Norway are breastfed for the first 6 months of life, monitoring POP contamination in breastmilk is important for children's health and development. This study aims to evaluate the current levels of various POPs in women's breastmilk in Innlandet County, Norway. A cross\u2010sectional study was conducted measuring concentrations of 35 different POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlordanes (ChlDs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), Mirex, and brominated flame retardants in 120 breastmilk samples. The study analysed the impact of maternal age, parity, pre\u2010pregnancy BMI, and infant age on POPs levels and compared the estimated daily intake per body weight of infants to existing health guidelines. The detected percentages for PCBs were 100%, for DDTs 98.3%, and for ChlDs 98.3%. The highest median concentration was found for \u03a3PCBs (26.9\u2009ng/g lw).

Our analysis is based on a weighted sample of 5,473 women from NFHS-4 and 5,103 women from NFHS-5. The study employs a two-stage estimation procedure using the Inverse Mills Ratio (IMR) framework to address potential biases in abortion reporting. In the second stage, we used a multinomial probit regression model to assess factors influencing post-abortion contraceptive use. Post-abortion contraceptive use increased from 49% in NFHS-4 to 57% in NFHS-5. Multinomial probit regression analysis revealed that gestational age of abortion was negatively associated with post-abortion contraceptive use, while factors such as having a son or prior contraceptive use increased the likelihood. Women who had abortions in private or non-health facilities were less likely to use post-abortion Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARC), compared to public health facilities. Those who reported unplanned pregnancy or contraceptive failure as the reason for abortion were more likely to use traditional methods of post-abortion contraception.

The pooled prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe nomophobia among medical students was found to be 25% (95% CI: 21%\u201330%), 59% (95% CI: 54%\u201363%), and 14% (95% CI: 12%\u201317%), respectively. Subgroup analyses indicated notable differences in the severity of nomophobia, with West Bengal [84.82 (95% CI: 75.39\u201394.25)] and Uttarakhand [81.49 (95% CI: 78.29\u201384.69)] having the highest mean scores of nomophobia and Gujarat [60.00 (95% CI: 58.61\u201361.39)] having the lowest. The results show that nomophobia is prevalent among Indian medical students, underscoring the need to implement support services for individuals struggling with technology addiction such as time management and mindfulness training.",
            "Bright light therapy (BLT) has been proved to have beneficial effects on Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), the mechanisms remained unclear. Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (\u0394scales), OCT (\u0394retinal thickness), PERG (\u0394PERG values) and VEP (\u0394P100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral \u0394N95 latencies for PERG and \u0394P100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT. BLT is a valuable and safe non-pharmacological intervention for improving visual function in PD patients. These findings extend neural mechanisms of BLT to visual pathways improvements.

            "Background: Traditional surgical education faces challenges such as limited visibility, physical space constraints, and restricted access for students. Virtual reality (VR) technology offers a promising alternative, especially with real-life 360-degree video, which can recreate immersive clinical experiences. This study investigates whether real-life 360-degree VR can enhance medical students' interest in neurosurgery and serve as an effective educational tool. Methods:\u00a0A VR-based educational program was developed using 360-degree video footage captured with Insta360 Pro cameras installed in the emergency department, operating room, and angiography suite. The content was incorporated into a neurosurgical clinical training course for 85 fifth-year medical students at the International University of Health and Welfare Narita Hospital in Narita, Japan. Students viewed the VR content through synchronized head-mounted displays. After the session, an anonymous questionnaire assessed usability, immersion, comprehension, enjoyment, and interest in neurosurgery. A paired samples t-test was used to compare students' interest in neurosurgery before and after the session. Results:\u00a0High levels of satisfaction were reported with regard to usability (95%) and immersion (97.6%). Most students agreed that the VR session improved their understanding (92.9%) and was enjoyable (95%). Interest in neurosurgery increased significantly following the session, with affirmative responses rising from 22 (26%) to 52 (61%) students (t=6.77; df=84; p<0.0001). Conclusion: Real-life 360-degree VR is an effective supplementary tool for neurosurgical education. It offers immersive experiences that can enhance student engagement, understanding, and interest in neurosurgery. Broader implementation of this technology may address declining interest in the specialty and enrich clinical education.",

The data collection consists of two parts: the first part is the clinical examination of the participants. All erupted teeth were clinically assessed by three calibrated examiners, and classified according to the basic erosive wear examination (BEWE); The second part is a questionnaire about demographic information, parafunctional movement and lifestyle, completed by the parents or their guardians. A total of 1,469 children were included in this experiment; erosive tooth wear (ETW) prevalence (BEWE \u2265 1) was 54.9%. According to cumulative BEWE index, the proportion of different ETW severity (high, medium, low, none) was 6.8%, 16.3%, 27.0% and 49.9%, respectively. In an analysis of risk factors, family factor, age, gender, extracurricular study time, oral hygiene habit, bruxism, unilateral mastication and acid diet was associated with the prevalence of ETW. This study shows that ETW has a high prevalence in students aged 6\u201312, and more common in deciduous molars and deciduous canine. Abrasion, attrition and erosion play an important role in ETW.",
            "Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are environmental contaminants that can accumulate in human tissues and pose potential health risks. Despite global efforts to reduce their prevalence, follow\u2010up studies are needed to see if the measures are successful. Since most infants in Norway are breastfed for the first 6 months of life, monitoring POP contamination in breastmilk is important for children's health and development. This study aims to evaluate the current levels of various POPs in women's breastmilk in Innlandet County, Norway. A cross\u2010sectional study was conducted measuring concentrations of 35 different POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlordanes (ChlDs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), Mirex, and brominated flame retardants in 120 breastmilk samples. The study analysed the impact of maternal age, parity, pre\u2010pregnancy BMI, and infant age on POPs levels and compared the estimated daily intake per body weight of infants to existing health guidelines. The detected percentages for PCBs were 100%, for DDTs 98.3%, and for ChlDs 98.3%. The highest median concentration was found for \u03a3PCBs (26.9\u2009ng/g lw). Maternal age, parity, and infant age were significant determinants of POP concentrations. Most infants exceeded the health\u2010based guidance values for \u03a3PCB, and 6.4% percent did so for \u03a3HCHs. Despite lower POPs concentrations in breastmilk than in earlier studies, many breastfed infants are still exposed to levels exceeding health\u2010based guidance values. Although the study's design had limitations, the study provides updated population\u2010based data on POPs in breastmilk. Continued monitoring and research are necessary to understand and mitigate potential health risks associated with POPs.",

A 6-month interventional study was conducted on 234 schoolchildren who were divided into three groups: group A received FV application at 3-month intervals, group B received weekly FMR, and group C received no fluoride application. A clinical oral examination and caries risk tests were performed at baseline and the 6-month follow-up. Caries prevalence and the debris score did not change statistically significantly from baseline to the 6-month follow-up in all groups, whereas the dmfs score statistically significantly increased in group C (p = 0.001). The plaque and saliva scores of Dentocult SM statistically significantly decreased in group A (p = 0.049 and p = 0.006), but those scores statistically significantly increased in group C (p = 0.001 and p = 0.014) after six months. On the other hand, no statistically significant changes were observed in group B. Although the Cariostat scores decreased from baseline to the 6-month follow-up in group A and group B, but increased in group C, no statistically significant differences were observed in any of the groups. Better anti-microbial effects were obtained for children who received FV application than for those who received FMR, but no statistically significant difference existed between the anti-caries effects of these two approaches.",
            "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and diabetes mellitus are both significant public health concerns that substantially impact global morbidity and death. However, there is currently limited information available on the prevalence of HBV infection among diabetic patients in eastern Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the seroprevalence and associated factors of the Hepatitis B virus among diabetic adult patients at Haramaya General Hospital in Eastern Ethiopia from August 8 to August 30, 2021. An institution-based cross-sectional study was done among 365 diabetic patients. Study participants were chosen using a consecutive sampling technique. Data on sociodemographic characteristics and other associated factors were collected using a structured questionnaire. A blood sample was drawn from each participant, and the serum was separated and tested for HBsAg status using the Rapid Test Kit (ACON, USA). The data was entered into Epi Data version 4.6 software and analysed using SPSS version 25. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association between the outcome variable and predictor factors. A  p A total of 365 individuals with diabetes took part in this study. The overall seroprevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen among these patients was 7.4% (95% CI\u202f=\u202f4.71\u201310.08). Among the total of 365, about 243 individuals (66.3%) were male, and the participants had a mean age of 42.24\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.2\u202fyears. The only significant risk factor for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection among the diabetic patients was having multiple sexual partners [AOR\u202f=\u202f2.92, 95% CI: 1.2\u20137.08]. This study found an intermediate prevalence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among people with diabetes. Multiple sexual partners were strongly associated with an increased likelihood of HBV infection. Based on these findings, it is recommended to implement routine HBsAg screening for diabetic patients during regular medical visits to enable earlier detection and timely treatment. The government also should increase vaccination coverage for diabetic patients. Healthcare facilities, regional authorities, and experts should also teach diabetes patients about hepatitis B transmission routes and prevention strategies, with an emphasis on modifiable variables.",
            "Several studies demonstrated compromised oral health and periodontal diseases as risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, consideration of oral health by pregnant women remains elusive. The aim of this study was to evaluate knowledge and behaviour of French pregnant women towards relationship between oral conditions and pregnancy outcomes and to evaluate influencing factors. A self-reported questionnaire was given to women between 1 and 3 days after delivery in three specialised clinics in France. The questionnaire aimed to evaluate demographic characteristics, self-perceived oral health, type of pregnancy follow-up and knowledge regarding oral conditions during pregnancy and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate correlation between knowledge and behaviour. The questionnaire was completed by 212 women. Among them, 92% considered prevention of oral diseases during pregnancy important. Despite knowledge of potential negative influence of periodontal diseases on pregnancy outcomes, only 47% of pregnant women received dental diagnosis or treatment during pregnancy. Only 18% of the women discussed oral health consideration during pregnancy with health professional in charge of pregnancy follow-up. Interestingly, absence of dental consultation during pregnancy was associated with low rate of dental consultation prior to pregnancy (p < 0.01). Pregnant women were aware of the association between oral health and pregnancy and of need of prevention. However, consideration of importance of oral health was not adequate to the rate of dental consultation and seems to be influenced by individual dental follow-up habits prior to pregnancy. Dental evaluation should be considered systematically during pregnancy follow-up.",

For example, complementing esports training with physical activities has been explored. However, most of these activities are based on traditional strength or endurance-related exercises, which do not align with the interests of children attending organized esports clubs. In this study, we investigate playful physical activities. Our research is based on qualitative pilot studies, where we observed and interviewed players ( N N The results are presented in this paper as three nonfictional short stories, creatively describing the lived experiences of the players and coaches. We emphasize patterns of shared meaning and identify the \u201cWhat's\u201d and \u201cHow's\u201d associated with esports training when playful physical activities are incorporated. Despite differences in form, duration, and intensity compared to activities referenced in the literature on esports and performance, our results demonstrate that playful activities positively influence esports players' skills and performance. Furthermore, our findings suggest that playful physical activities, as opposed to traditional strength and endurance exercises, often associated with physical activity, are acceptable for esports coaches. However, for maximum impact, these activities must be relevant and directly related to the games played in the esports clubs. Based on our research, we recommend implementing playful physical activities that align with the actual esports training to support developing and optimizing players' esports skills and performance.",

Therefore, accurately determining Glu levels is crucial for clinical diagnosis and other applications. Carbon dots (CDs) are a novel category of carbon nanomaterials that exhibit outstanding optical properties, excellent biocompatibility, high water solubility, low production costs, and straightforward synthesis. Recently, researchers have developed various carbon dot sensors for fast and real-time Glu monitoring. In this context, we provide a comprehensive introduction to Glu and CDs for the first time. We categorize the synthetic methods for CDs and the sensing mechanisms, further classifying the applications of carbon dot probes into single-probe sensing, ratiometric sensing, and visual detection. Finally, we discuss the future development needs for CD-based Glu sensors. This review aims to offer insights into advancing Glu sensors and modern medical treatments.",

            "Understanding accurate methods for predicting yields in complex agricultural systems is critical for effective nutrient management and crop growth. Machine learning has proven to be an important tool in this context. Numerous studies have investigated its potential for predicting yields under different conditions. Among these algorithms, Random Forest (RF) has gained prominence due to its ability to manage large data sets with high dimensions, as well as its ability to uncover complicated non-linear relationships and interactions between variables. RF is particularly suitable for scenarios with categorical variables and missing data. Given the complex web of management practices and their nonlinear effects on yield prediction, it is important to investigate new machine learning algorithms. In this context, our study focused on the evaluation of gradient boosting methods, particularly Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), as potential candidates for yield estimation of the maize hybrid Zhengdan 958. Our aim was not only to evaluate and compare these algorithms with existing approaches, but also to comprehensively analyze the resulting model uncertainties. Our approach includes comparing multiple machine learning algorithms, developing and selecting suitable features, fine-tuning the models by training and adjusting the hyperparameters, and visualizing the results. Using a recent dataset of over 1700 maize yield data pairs, our evaluation included a spectrum of algorithms. Our results show robust prediction accuracy for all algorithms.

This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants\u2019 workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.",

We observed a successful transfer of the microbiotas after cohousing including specific microbiota differences induced by CS exposure in formerly GF mice, which were never exposed to CS. We then investigated the effects of IAV infection on the disease course and microbiotas of formerly GF mice.

However, the substantial individual heterogeneity among patients poses a challenge to reaching a unified conclusion. To address this variability, our study adopts a novel framework to parse individualized ALFF abnormalities. We hypothesize that individualized ALFF abnormalities can be portrayed as a unique linear combination of shared differential factors. Our study involved two large multi-center datasets, comprising 2424 patients with MDD and 2183 healthy controls. In patients, individualized ALFF abnormalities were derived through normative modeling and further deconstructed into differential factors using non-negative matrix factorization. Two positive and two negative factors were identified. These factors were closely linked to clinical characteristics and explained group-level ALFF abnormalities in the two datasets. Moreover, these factors exhibited distinct associations with the distribution of neurotransmitter receptors/transporters, transcriptional profiles of inflammation-related genes, and connectome-informed epicenters, underscoring their neurobiological relevance. Additionally, factor compositions facilitated the identification of four distinct depressive subtypes, each characterized by unique abnormal ALFF patterns and clinical features. Importantly, these findings were successfully replicated in another dataset with different acquisition equipment, protocols, preprocessing strategies, and medication statuses, validating their robustness and generalizability. This research identifies shared differential factors underlying individual spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in MDD and contributes novel insights into the heterogeneity of spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in MDD.",

These mutations are not evenly distributed on the RBD surface but cluster on several distinct surfaces, suggesting an influence of the targeted epitope on the capacity to neutralize a broad range of VOCs. Here, we identified a potent nAb from convalescent patients targeting the receptor-binding domain of a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Except for the Lambda and BA.2.86 variants, this nAb efficiently inhibited the entry of most tested VOCs, including Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2, XBB.1.5, and EG.5.1 and to a limited extent also BA.4/5, BA.4.6, and BQ.1.1. It bound recombinant S protein with picomolar affinity, reduced the viral load in the lung of infected hamsters, and prevented the severe lung pathology typical for SARS-CoV-2 infections. An X-ray structure of the nAb-RBD complex revealed an epitope that does not fall into any of the conventional classes and provided insights into its broad neutralization properties. Our findings highlight a conserved epitope within the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that should be preferably targeted by therapeutic antibodies and inform rational vaccine development. Therapeutic antibodies are effective in preventing severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection and constitute an important option in pandemic preparedness, but mutations within the S protein of virus variants (e.g., a mutation of L452) confer resistance to many of such antibodies. Here, we identify a human antibody targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) with an elevated escape barrier and characterize its interaction with the RBD functionally and structurally at the atomic level. A direct comparison with reported antibodies targeting the same epitope illustrates important differences in the interface, providing insights into the breadth of antibody binding. These findings highlight the relevance of an extended neutralization profiling in combination with biochemical and structural characterization of the antibody-RBD interaction for the selection of future therapeutic antibodies, which may accelerate the control of potential future pandemics.",

            "In contemporary neuroimaging studies, it has been observed that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibit aberrant spontaneous neural activity, commonly quantified through the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF). However, the substantial individual heterogeneity among patients poses a challenge to reaching a unified conclusion. To address this variability, our study adopts a novel framework to parse individualized ALFF abnormalities. We hypothesize that individualized ALFF abnormalities can be portrayed as a unique linear combination of shared differential factors. Our study involved two large multi-center datasets, comprising 2424 patients with MDD and 2183 healthy controls. In patients, individualized ALFF abnormalities were derived through normative modeling and further deconstructed into differential factors using non-negative matrix factorization. Two positive and two negative factors were identified. These factors were closely linked to clinical characteristics and explained group-level ALFF abnormalities in the two datasets. Moreover, these factors exhibited distinct associations with the distribution of neurotransmitter receptors/transporters, transcriptional profiles of inflammation-related genes, and connectome-informed epicenters, underscoring their neurobiological relevance. Additionally, factor compositions facilitated the identification of four distinct depressive subtypes, each characterized by unique abnormal ALFF patterns and clinical features. Importantly, these findings were successfully replicated in another dataset with different acquisition equipment, protocols, preprocessing strategies, and medication statuses, validating their robustness and generalizability. This research identifies shared differential factors underlying individual spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in MDD and contributes novel insights into the heterogeneity of spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in MDD.",

            "The effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic antibodies targeting the spike (S) receptor-binding domain (RBD) has been hampered by the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs), which have acquired mutations to escape neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). These mutations are not evenly distributed on the RBD surface but cluster on several distinct surfaces, suggesting an influence of the targeted epitope on the capacity to neutralize a broad range of VOCs. Here, we identified a potent nAb from convalescent patients targeting the receptor-binding domain of a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Except for the Lambda and BA.2.86 variants, this nAb efficiently inhibited the entry of most tested VOCs, including Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2, XBB.1.5, and EG.5.1 and to a limited extent also BA.4/5, BA.4.6, and BQ.1.1. It bound recombinant S protein with picomolar affinity, reduced the viral load in the lung of infected hamsters, and prevented the severe lung pathology typical for SARS-CoV-2 infections. An X-ray structure of the nAb-RBD complex revealed an epitope that does not fall into any of the conventional classes and provided insights into its broad neutralization properties. Our findings highlight a conserved epitope within the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that should be preferably targeted by therapeutic antibodies and inform rational vaccine development. Therapeutic antibodies are effective in preventing severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection and constitute an important option in pandemic preparedness, but mutations within the S protein of virus variants (e.g., a mutation of L452) confer resistance to many of such antibodies. Here, we identify a human antibody targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) with an elevated escape barrier and characterize its interaction with the RBD functionally and structurally at the atomic level. A direct comparison with reported antibodies targeting the same epitope illustrates important differences in the interface, providing insights into the breadth of antibody binding. These findings highlight the relevance of an extended neutralization profiling in combination with biochemical and structural characterization of the antibody-RBD interaction for the selection of future therapeutic antibodies, which may accelerate the control of potential future pandemics.",

Given that SARS-CoV-2 has some characteristics not found in other closely related viruses, we aimed to systematically assess how likely these unique features may have been acquired through recombination. We found that, although recombination is a frequent phenomenon among betacoronaviruses, it is mostly limited to closely related members of the same species. Therefore, we conclude that the most likely scenario involved feature acquisition from recombination with a closely related virus that was circulating in a geographically overlapping area or through a different biological process, but not recombination from a virus of a different species, genus, or subgenus.",

Current research on the presence of ARGs in microorganisms focuses mainly on humans, livestock, hospitals, or wastewater. However, the spectrum of ARGs in the dust resistome in workplaces and households has gone relatively unexplored. This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants\u2019 workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.",

It is well-documented that parents of children with ASD often experience psychiatric conditions like anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, research on the perception of internalized stigma, family functioning, and their interconnections is scarce. The main objective of our study was to analyze the internalized stigma perceptions, depression, anxiety, and family functioning among parents or caregivers of children diagnosed with ASD. Methods This study was conducted on 102 cases and 101 healthy controls in a cross-sectional case-control study involving patients aged 3-12 years. The research was carried out at the Child Psychiatry Clinic of Adana City Training and Research Hospital and three Family Health Centers in Adana from October 15 to December 15, 2022. Sociodemographic data, family history, families' knowledge levels about autism, and information about their social lives were collected using a face-to-face structured questionnaire. The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD), and Family APGAR scales were administered. Results The mean ISMI score of the case group was 67.31\u00b18.91. According to the HAD Anxiety scale score, 60.8% of the case group and 14.9% of the control group were at high risk (p<0.001). According to the HAD Depression Scale, 52% of the case group participants and 25.7% of the control group were at high risk (p<0.001). The rate of severe familial dysfunction was 18.6% in the case group and 3.0% in the control group (p<0.001). Conclusion Stigma, anxiety, depression, and family functioning in parents of children diagnosed with ASD lead to various adverse outcomes.

They are scintillator based detectors that detect the scintillation light on an individual photon basis via an image intensifier and a fast image sensor. Their readout operates in event mode i.e. it produces information about individual neutron interactions, reconstructed from the sensor data, thus enabling to achieve superior spatial and temporal resolutions compared to regular detectors. Although the development of current detectors is focused on neutrons, the concept is also applicable to the detection of other particles such as high-energy photons.

A total of 33 athletes with patellar tendinopathy were randomized into two groups. PRP\u2009+\u2009Sham (PS) group received intraarticular injection of autologous PRP (5\u00a0mL) once and sham ESWT. PRP\u2009+\u2009ESWT (PE) group received intraarticular injection of autologous PRP once and after 1\u00a0week ESWT (0.2\u00a0mJ/mm Autologous PRP injection and its combination with ESWT are both effective treatments for chronic patellar tendinopathy in athletes. PRP combined with ESWT resulted in faster reduction of knee pain than PRP alone at the 1-month follow-up. Serum IL-33 showed no significant difference at the 12-month follow-up. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-15, and IL-17 increased at the 12-month follow-up, potentially due to the additional training. However, the athletes did not report any discomfort or injuries, and no abnormalities were detected by ultrasonography after study. We demonstrated improvements in pain and functional scores, as well as knee injury protection in athletes, following 12\u00a0months of PRP and PRP with ESWT treatments. The study analyzed the therapeutic effect of PRP injection alone and combining PRP injection with ESWT for chronic patellar tendinopathy. Our results showed that combined treatment can facilitate the pain relief early than PRP alone and is a safety treatment modality. No adverse effect was noted in our study.

            "Orthorexia nervosa (OrNe), the obsessive fixation on healthy eating, and exercise addiction (ExAdd) have been discussed as correlated excessive health behaviors with potential mental health implications. The role of gender-and sports-specific differences remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the links of ExAdd, OrNe, and the non-pathological interest in healthy eating (healthy orthorexia; HeOr) with well-being and exercise activity in various sports, considering gender effects. Data from two cross-sectional online surveys were combined ( N Well-being correlated with OrNe among women ( r Men\u2019s well-being may slightly benefit from ExAdd and an interest in healthy eating, while obsessive healthy eating may reduce women\u2019s well-being. Although exercise activity is associated with ExAdd in a wide variety of sports, it does not explain the link between ExAdd and OrNe. Preventive measures should consider gender-specific risks in excessive health behaviors.",
            "Introduction Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder that impacts communication, behavior, and social interaction. It is well-documented that parents of children with ASD often experience psychiatric conditions like anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, research on the perception of internalized stigma, family functioning, and their interconnections is scarce. The main objective of our study was to analyze the internalized stigma perceptions, depression, anxiety, and family functioning among parents or caregivers of children diagnosed with ASD. Methods This study was conducted on 102 cases and 101 healthy controls in a cross-sectional case-control study involving patients aged 3-12 years. The research was carried out at the Child Psychiatry Clinic of Adana City Training and Research Hospital and three Family Health Centers in Adana from October 15 to December 15, 2022. Sociodemographic data, family history, families' knowledge levels about autism, and information about their social lives were collected using a face-to-face structured questionnaire. The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD), and Family APGAR scales were administered. Results The mean ISMI score of the case group was 67.31\u00b18.91. According to the HAD Anxiety scale score, 60.8% of the case group and 14.9% of the control group were at high risk (p<0.001). According to the HAD Depression Scale, 52% of the case group participants and 25.7% of the control group were at high risk (p<0.001). The rate of severe familial dysfunction was 18.6% in the case group and 3.0% in the control group (p<0.001). Conclusion Stigma, anxiety, depression, and family functioning in parents of children diagnosed with ASD lead to various adverse outcomes. Further studies are necessary to prevent these negative experiences for families of children with ASD and to facilitate the integration of these children into society.",
            "The melanocortin system is fundamental to neural control of energy balance and long-term weight regulation. Recent evidence shows that melanocortins also act at peripheral tissues to regulate metabolism, independent of the brain or the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). One such target is skeletal muscle, which contributes to energy expenditure through changes in adaptive thermogenesis. We aimed to determine 1) whether direct femoral infusion of \u03b1-melanocyte\u2013stimulating hormone (\u03b1MSH) could increase muscle heat production independent of SNS activation and 2) if \u03b1MSH-induced skeletal muscle heat production was associated with altered mitochondrial function. Dataloggers were implanted into one hind leg of ovariectomized ewes and set to record vastus lateralis temperature every 15 minutes.

Diagnosis is challenging, and early intervention is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Various factors such as background factors, symptoms, biomarkers, and imaging techniques contribute to the diagnosis. Ensuring an early diagnosis and prompt treatment is of paramount importance. Although studies reported on the effectiveness of intra-arterial vasodilator infusion therapy as an endovascular treatment, its future role remains uncertain. Therefore, this review primarily aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the advancements in the current state of NOMI management, with a specific emphasis on the implementation of endovascular therapy.",
            "Spinal cord ischemia due to damage or occlusion of the orifices of aortic segmental arteries (ASA) is a serious complication of open and endovascular aortic repair. Our study aims to provide detailed descriptions of the proximal course of the ASAs and metric information on their origins. Initially, 200 randomly selected, embalmed cadavers of human body donors were anatomically dissected and systematically examined. On macroscopic inspection, 47 showed severe pathologies and were excluded. Of the remaining 153, 73 were males and 80 females. In total, 69.9% of the aortae showed 26\u201328 ASA orifices. In 59.5% the most proximal ASA, at least unilaterally, was the third posterior intercostal artery, which originated from the descending aorta at approximately 10% of its length. In 56.2%, the left and right ASAs had a common origin in at least one body segment. This mainly affected the abdominal aorta and L4 in particular (54.2%). The ASAs of lumber segments 1\u20133 originated strictly segmentally. In contrast, in 80.4%, at least one posterior intercostal artery originated from a cranially or caudally located ipsilateral ASA. Such an arrangement was seen along the entire thoracic aorta. Further descriptions of variants and metric data on ASA orifices are presented. Our large-scale study presents a detailed topographic map of ASAs. It underscores the value of preoperative CT councils and provides crucial information for interpreting the results. Furthermore, it aids in planning and conducting safe aortic intervention and assists in deciding on single- or two-staged stent graft procedures.",

The most common pathology associated with the seminal vesicles is infective, and patients may present with haematospermia, pain, and subfertility. Patients presenting with unilateral ureteric obstruction secondary to seminal vesiculitis are rare, and there are very few reported cases in the literature. This case report aims to review the presentation and management of such a case.\nA 59-year-old male presented to the emergency department with right-sided abdominal pain, vomiting, haematuria, and reduced urinary output. Blood tests showed raised inflammatory markers, hyperkalaemia, and a significant acute kidney injury with a creatinine of 695 \u00b5mol/L and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 7 from a normal baseline. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) imaging of the renal tracts identified an atrophic left kidney and a large soft tissue lesion at the level of the distal third of the right ureter, concerning for a primary ureteric malignancy. Notably, urine samples sent for cytology were reported as negative for malignancy. Following drainage and recovery from the acute episode, a timely outpatient ureteroscopy revealed no abnormalities of the ureter, and a subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) concluded right-sided seminal vesiculitis as the cause of this patient\u2019s presentation.\nThis case report demonstrates seminal vesiculitis as a rare cause of ureteric obstruction.

            "A new type of position-sensitive detectors is gaining attention in the neutron community. They are scintillator based detectors that detect the scintillation light on an individual photon basis via an image intensifier and a fast image sensor. Their readout operates in event mode i.e. it produces information about individual neutron interactions, reconstructed from the sensor data, thus enabling to achieve superior spatial and temporal resolutions compared to regular detectors. Although the development of current detectors is focused on neutrons, the concept is also applicable to the detection of other particles such as high-energy photons. This document provides a description on how these detectors are built, how they operate, and what their characteristics are. An example of a detector implementation based on a Timepix3 chip is described to illustrate the detector concept. This includes a detailed description of the algorithm that reconstructs the neutron interactions from the sensor data, one of the core components that sets it apart from established scintillator-based imaging detectors. Energy-resolved epithermal neutron radiography was performed at the ISIS EMMA beamline with this detector, illustrating some of the fundamental differences in the data that can be produced with the new type of detector compared to more established types of scintillator based neutron detectors. The term LumaCam is proposed to refer to this new class of position-sensitive event-mode detectors.",
            "The therapeutic potential of gene editing technologies hinges on the development of safe and effective delivery methods. In this study, we developed a temperature-sensitive and less immunogenic Sendai virus (ts SeV) as a novel delivery vector for CRISPR-Cas9 and for efficient gene editing in sensitive human cell types with limited induction of an innate immune response. ts SeV demonstrates high transduction efficiency in human CD34 CCR5 CCR5 Gene editing has the potential to be a powerful tool for the treatment of human diseases including HIV, \u03b2-thalassemias, and sickle cell disease. Recent advances have begun to overcome one of the major limiting factors of this technology, namely delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing machinery, by utilizing viral vectors. However, gene editing therapies have yet to be implemented due to inherent risks associated with the DNA viral vectors typically used for delivery. As an alternative strategy, we have developed an RNA-based Sendai virus CRISPR-Cas9 delivery vector that does not integrate into the genome, is temperature sensitive, and does not induce a significant host interferon response. This recombinant SeV successfully delivered CRISPR-Cas9 in primary human CD14+ monocytes  ex vivo",
            "Usenamine A (UA) is a natural compound isolated from the lichen  Usnea diffracta Molecular docking was performed between the 3D structure of UA and the TNF-TNFR2 complex. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA and AS patients were treated with UA, and cell viability was measured using the MTS assay and flow cytometry. The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of \u22125.251 kcal/mol and \u22126.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients. In the arthritis mouse model, significantly reduced clinical and histological scores were observed in the UA treatment group. Our findings suggest that UA has potential as a binding target for TNF, suppresses inflammatory cytokines in PBMCs, and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on arthritis in a mouse model.",

Age-specific risk classification was assessed using relative risk thresholds equivalent to the absolute lifetime risk categories of less than 17%, 17%-30%, and 30% or more, recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. We predicted 10-year risks using BOADICEA v.6 considering cancer family history, questionnaire-based risk factors, a 313\u2013single nucleotide polymorphisms polygenic score, and pathogenic variants. Mammographic density data were not available. The polygenic risk score was the most discriminative risk factor (area under the curve [AUC]\u2009=\u20090.65).

In this work, we report modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-vectored vaccines designed to express protein VP2 of EHDV-8 or protein VP7 of EHDV-2. Prime boost immunization of adult IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice with the MVA-VP2 vaccine candidate induced high titers of EHDV-8-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and conferred full protection against homologous lethal challenge with EHDV-8. However, no heterologous protection was observed after lethal challenge with EHDV-6. In contrast, the MVA-VP7 vaccine candidate elicited strong cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell responses against VP7 and conferred complete protection against lethal challenge with either EHDV-8 or EHDV-6 in IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice in the absence of NAbs, being the first multiserotype vaccine candidate against EHDV. Moreover, we expressed recombinant proteins VP2 and VP7 of EHDV in the baculovirus expression system, which were used to analyze the potential DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) character of these vaccine candidates. Emergence and re-emergence of arthropod-borne viruses are major concerns for both human and animal health. The most recent example is the fast expansion of EHDV-8 through Europe. Besides, EHDV-8 relates with a high prevalence of pathologic cases in cattle populations. No vaccine is currently available in Europe, and vaccine research against this arboviral disease is negligible. In this work, we present novel DIVA vaccine candidates against EHDV, and most importantly, we identified the protein VP7 of EHDV as an antigen capable of inducing multiserotype protection, one of the major challenges in vaccine research against orbiviruses.",

However, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) severity varied highly between unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated individuals, for unknown reasons. We assessed the severity of BA.5 infection and the risk of XBB strain reinfection and measured serum levels of NAbs against WT, BA.5, and XBB.1.9.1 SARS-CoV-2 strains at varying time points in 1,373 individuals who received zero, one, two, or three WT vaccine doses. We found that two to three WT doses significantly increased WT and BA.5 NAb levels and reduced the incidence of COVID-19-associated pneumonia upon BA.5 strain infection compared to zero to one dose. Regarding XBB reinfection, those who received two to three doses and were infected with the BA.5 variant exhibited a significantly lower reinfection risk compared to those who received zero to one dose. RNA analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes between the two to three dose and unvaccinated groups were enriched in B cell activation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, complement, and monocyte activation functions\u2014indicating that vaccination increased the antibody response and reduced inflammation. Our results suggest that multiple antigen exposures to either matched or unmatched SARS-COV-2 variants, through vaccination or infection, may be necessary to achieve significant immune imprinting. The administration of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccines that do not perfectly match the viral strains that individuals become infected with has been found to impact the resultant illness severity\u2014although the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. We assessed viral clearance, as well as serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against wild-type, BA.5, and XBB.1.9.1 variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among individuals who received varying doses of such strain-mismatched vaccines. Notably, vaccination with \u22652 doses of strain-mismatched COVID-19 vaccines appeared to stimulate the production of specific NAbs during infection with new variants, as well as attenuate the inflammatory response and enhance viral clearance. Such vaccination regimens can also reduce the risk of reinfection. These findings may be important for guiding the development of future COVID-19 vaccination strategies that target both matched and mismatched viral variants.",

Alum adjuvants usually inefficiently assist recombinant proteins to induce cellular immune responses. Thus, novel adjuvants are required to develop NoV vaccines that could induce both efficient humoral and robust cellular immune responses. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are well-known mRNA delivery vehicles. Increasing evidence suggests that LNPs may have intrinsic adjuvant activity and can be used as adjuvants for recombinant protein vaccines; however, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, we compared the adjuvant effect of LNPs and Alum for a bivalent GI.1/GII.4 NoV VLP vaccine. Compared with Alum, LNP-adjuvanted vaccines induced earlier production of binding, blocking, and neutralizing antibodies and promoted a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 ratio.

Here we show that the depletion of tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), causes synthetic dosage lethality (SDL) in MAD2-overexpressing cells, and we term this cell death MAD2-overexpressing interphase cell death (MOID). The induction of MOID depends on PML and DAXX mediating mitochondrial AIFM1-release. MAD2, TSG101, and AIF-PML-DAXX axis regulate mitochondria, PML nuclear bodies (NBs), and autophagy with close inter-dependent protein stability in survival cells. Loss of C-terminal phosphorylation(s) of TSG101 and closed (C-)MAD2-overexpression contribute to induce MOID. In survival cells, both MAD2 and TSG101 localize at PML NBs in interphase, and TSG101 Y390 phosphorylation is required for localization of TSG101 to PML NBs. PML release from PML NBs through PML deSUMOylation contributes to induce MOID. The post-transcriptional/translational cell death machinery and the non-canonical transcriptional regulation are intricately linked to MOID, and ER-MAM, may serve as a crucial intersection for MOID signaling.",

We found that two to three WT doses significantly increased WT and BA.5 NAb levels and reduced the incidence of COVID-19-associated pneumonia upon BA.5 strain infection compared to zero to one dose. Regarding XBB reinfection, those who received two to three doses and were infected with the BA.5 variant exhibited a significantly lower reinfection risk compared to those who received zero to one dose.

In Ethiopia, Afar pastoralists migrate seasonally with their livestock in search for grazing and water areas. Livestock are also a source of infectious diseases that can spread into wildlife populations when pastoralists encroach into unfenced national parks. The interactions between pastoralists and national parks, as well as the subsequent impacts, remain insufficiently understood in Afar. Two structured questionnaire surveys were conducted in 2021, including 300 pastoralist households in seven woredas of Afar, and 58 staff from three national parks (Awash, Alidegi and Yangudi Rassa). They captured pastoralist movements and livestock diseases as well as the perception of national park staff regarding challenges resulting from pastoral encroachment into parks. Among the pastoralists, 74.7% migrated with their livestock for a mean 3.5\u00a0months per year, during which time, 90% of respondents reported contact with other livestock herds, and over 80% with wildlife. A third (34.2%) reported disease outbreaks in their village prior to migration. Pastoralists traveled long distances, crossing woreda, regional or national boundaries. All 58-park respondents reported pastoralists with livestock inside their park and their close contact with wildlife. Additionally, 69% reported the presence of domestic dogs. Wildlife displacement, habitat loss and dog attacks on wildlife were perceived as the main threat caused by the presence of pastoralists, whereas diseases were only mentioned by 15.5%. Overall, park staff showed poor disease knowledge. They reported poor disease surveillance and no disease response. Within pastoral contexts, improved collaboration between wildlife and livestock authorities regarding land use, disease awareness and surveillance is needed to balance the needs of both wildlife and pastoralist\u2019s livestock development and mitigate threats to wildlife habitats.",

These \u2018silent\u2019 infections camouflaged the actual incidence of the disease, leading to downward biases in the rates of transmission, disease prevalence, and fatality. These, in turn, had implications for how people and policymakers responded to changing infection prevalence. This paper posits that in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, a considerable number of SARS-CoV-2 infections spread through asymptomatic infected individuals who lacked economic incentives to test and isolate adequately. The decision to undertake testing and the subsequent possibility of isolation entails a calculus of benefits and costs for an individual. Given that the perceived net benefit of such actions is correlated with the observed risk of infection, the likelihood of an asymptomatic individual choosing to undergo testing increases with the existing infection prevalence rate. This behavior, in turn, influenced disease transmission and mortality dynamics. This study presents an analytical framework that integrates prevalence-dependent testing behavior into a traditional epidemiological model. The model\u2019s predictions provide critical policy insights. It reveals that failing to account for testing and isolation behavior results in underestimation of the infection propagation and fatality rates when reported disease prevalence is low, thereby, skewing the containment strategies in the initial and late stages of a pandemic. The findings underscore the necessity of enhancing testing capacity as a crucial countermeasure for future contagions like COVID-19.",

This study used the perspective of those offering support to infer whether people with HD view their support differently, or if there is a gap in support quality compared with those with OCD. The design was cross\u2010sectional, comparing those supporting OCD with those supporting HD. An online questionnaire was completed by 116 people offering support (POS) to people with these conditions. Support quality was measured using an adapted, proxy version of the Revised Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire. The research hypothesized that POS(HD) would not differ on support ratings compared with POS(OCD); or that POS(HD) would report comparatively lower ratings across support components. Secondary analysis investigated group differences in stigmatized attitudes and associative stigma; internalized stigma by virtue of having a connection to a stigmatized individual. POS(HD) rated their wish to support and the perceived success as significantly lower. Public stigma was rated more highly by POS(HD) relative to POS(OCD) and associative stigma felt more acutely by POS(HD). Motivation to support was significantly lower in the HD group with associative stigma a significant predictive factor. Further research involving dyads is needed to investigate what is causing this shortfall in support. Clinical research for HD interventions should also examine how involving POS could enhance treatment outcomes.",

Based on existing literature, 11 predictors were tested in this study. The CoLaus cohort was used to develop the model by applying the backward-elimination approach and Bayesian Model Averaging. Internal validation was performed by bootstrapping. External validation was performed using data from the PREVEND cohort and recalibrating the baseline survival estimate. C-statistics, calibration slopes, and expected/observed probabilities were calculated as measures of model internal and/or external performances. The final analysis included 750 and 1032 premenopausal women from the CoLaus and the PREVEND cohorts, respectively.

However, to date, transcriptional signatures of autophagy-related genes during PAH are not well characterized. We analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and revealed the relationship between autophagy and PAH in EC from the perspective of differential expression, transcriptional signature typing, comparative analysis, pseudo-temporal changes of autophagy genes, and high dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA) networks of autophagy genes. Moreover, we established an  in vitro t Single-cell data showed that ECs had three different subgroups, namely Endo-Nor (normal state), Endo-Mid (transition state), and Endo-PAH (PAH disease group). Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes between Endo-PAH and Endo-Nor showed that autophagy and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathways were abnormal. Pseudo-temporal trajectory analysis showed that eight autophagy-related genes were involved in regulating PAH progression. Furthermore, the hdWGCNA network revealed six autophagy-related PAH progression genes. By comprehensively comparing different analysis methods, we identified  Ddit4 This study dissected the expression signature of autophagy genes in PAH at single-cell resolution and identified DDIT4 as a potential biomarker.",

Understanding these effects is essential for optimizing agricultural practices and enhancing crop productivity. To investigate the effects of sowing dates on biomass allocation and allometric growth, a field experiment was conducted with sequential sowings of Fagopyrum esculentum from April 12th to August 11th in 2018. Biomass measurements were taken across various plant organs, and corresponding allocation calculations were made. A detailed analysis of the allometric growth relationship involving organ biomass variations was performed. The study revealed that the accumulation and allocation of organ biomass in buckwheat were significantly impacted by the sowing dates. Delayed planting led to reduced vegetative growth and increased biomass allocation towards reproduction. Allometric parameters such as exponent, constant, and individual size of buckwheat were notably affected by delayed planting. Interestingly, the allometric exponents governing the relationships between reproductive vs. vegetative biomass and belowground vs. aboveground biomass exhibited varying trends across different sowing dates. Notably, late sowings resulted in significantly higher reproductive biomass compared to early and middle sowings. These findings highlight the nuanced relationship between plant size and reproductive biomass under different sowing dates, emphasizing the critical role of planting timing in shaping mature plant sizes and reproductive outcomes. The study underscores the importance of considering sowing dates in agricultural practices to optimize plant growth and productivity.",

Our analysis is based on a weighted sample of 5,473 women from NFHS-4 and 5,103 women from NFHS-5. The study employs a two-stage estimation procedure using the Inverse Mills Ratio (IMR) framework to address potential biases in abortion reporting. In the second stage, we used a multinomial probit regression model to assess factors influencing post-abortion contraceptive use. Post-abortion contraceptive use increased from 49% in NFHS-4 to 57% in NFHS-5. Multinomial probit regression analysis revealed that gestational age of abortion was negatively associated with post-abortion contraceptive use, while factors such as having a son or prior contraceptive use increased the likelihood. Women who had abortions in private or non-health facilities were less likely to use post-abortion Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARC), compared to public health facilities. Those who reported unplanned pregnancy or contraceptive failure as the reason for abortion were more likely to use traditional methods of post-abortion contraception.

A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR.

However, the substantial individual heterogeneity among patients poses a challenge to reaching a unified conclusion. To address this variability, our study adopts a novel framework to parse individualized ALFF abnormalities. We hypothesize that individualized ALFF abnormalities can be portrayed as a unique linear combination of shared differential factors. Our study involved two large multi-center datasets, comprising 2424 patients with MDD and 2183 healthy controls. In patients, individualized ALFF abnormalities were derived through normative modeling and further deconstructed into differential factors using non-negative matrix factorization. Two positive and two negative factors were identified. These factors were closely linked to clinical characteristics and explained group-level ALFF abnormalities in the two datasets. Moreover, these factors exhibited distinct associations with the distribution of neurotransmitter receptors/transporters, transcriptional profiles of inflammation-related genes, and connectome-informed epicenters, underscoring their neurobiological relevance. Additionally, factor compositions facilitated the identification of four distinct depressive subtypes, each characterized by unique abnormal ALFF patterns and clinical features. Importantly, these findings were successfully replicated in another dataset with different acquisition equipment, protocols, preprocessing strategies, and medication statuses, validating their robustness and generalizability. This research identifies shared differential factors underlying individual spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in MDD and contributes novel insights into the heterogeneity of spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in MDD.",

In this report, we describe a case of external auditory canal obstruction caused by a temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ganglion that was thought to be related to osteoarthritis. A 62-year-old man with the chief complaint of swelling of the anterior wall of the left external auditory canal underwent cystectomy at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology. Histopathological examination revealed a ganglion. Three months later, the swelling reappeared; computed tomography revealed an enlarged left temporomandibular head, which prompted the patient to visit our department. Subsequently, the ear canal was completely obstructed due to worsened swelling, and TMJ arthroplasty and ear canalplasty were performed. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well with no recurrence of swelling. Ganglions that arise as masses in the external auditory canal may be accompanied by osteoarthritis.",

After a third COVID-19 infection, she experienced intense pain in multiple hand joints and lethargy. The blood tests were normal, and the ultrasound report revealed tenosynovitis of the wrist joint. Her pain improved with combined treatment approaches.\u00a0 To our knowledge, this is the first case report of post-COVID-19 tenosynovitis. We have also highlighted the predisposing factors for the development of tenosynovitis, which may include being unvaccinated and lifestyle changes, such as a sedentary routine.
