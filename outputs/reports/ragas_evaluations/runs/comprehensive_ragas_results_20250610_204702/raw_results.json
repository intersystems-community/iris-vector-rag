        "question": "What are the effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes?",
        "answer": "Metformin is commonly prescribed as a first-line medication for the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Its primary effects on T2D include:\n\n1. **Lowering Glucose Production**: Metformin helps to reduce the amount of glucose produced by the liver, which is crucial for controlling blood sugar levels in individuals with T2D.\n\n2. **Improving Insulin Sensitivity**: The medication enhances the sensitivity of body tissues to insulin, allowing for better utilization of glucose by the cells. This is particularly important for individuals with insulin resistance, a hallmark of T2D.\n\n3. **Weight Management**: While not explicitly mentioned in the context documents, metformin is often associated with weight neutrality or modest weight loss, which can be beneficial for many patients with T2D who are overweight or obese.\n\n4. **Potential Cardiovascular Benefits**: Although not detailed in the provided documents, metformin has been suggested to have cardiovascular protective effects, which is an important consideration in the management of T2D, given the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in these patients.\n\nThe context documents do not provide specific information on the long-term effects of metformin, potential side effects, or comparisons with other diabetes medications. Additionally, there is no mention of its role in the perioperative management of diabetic patients or its interactions with other diabetes therapies. More comprehensive information on these aspects would be beneficial for a complete understanding of metformin's effects on type 2 diabetes.",

          "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world. While the key elements are agreed upon, more research and global collaboration are needed to create consistent guidelines and improve patient outcomes.",
          "We report the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy with a history of recurrent and severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy with an uncommon clinical presentation. This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",
          "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1- and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist tirzepatide (referred to here collectively as \u201cGLP-1-based therapy\u201d) are incretin-based therapies being used increasingly in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity. They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease. In this review, we summarize the effects of GLP-1 and incretin-based therapeutics on gastric, biliary and small intestinal function.

        "question": "How does SGLT2 inhibition affect kidney function?",
        "answer": "The context documents provided do not directly address the specific effects of SGLT2 inhibition on kidney function. However, we can infer some relevant information based on the broader context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the use of SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\n1. **SGLT2 Inhibitors and CKD**: Document 1 mentions that the indications for SGLT2 inhibitors have expanded to include chronic kidney disease (CKD) after 2020. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors are now recognized as beneficial for patients with CKD, potentially improving kidney function or slowing the progression of kidney disease.\n\n2. **Demographic Trends**: The increase in prescriptions of SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly among the elderly population, indicates a growing recognition of their role in managing conditions associated with kidney function decline. The document notes that a specific SGLT2 inhibitor, which expanded its indications for heart failure and CKD, showed a significant increase in prescriptions, suggesting its effectiveness in these populations.\n\n3. **Indirect Evidence**: While the documents do not provide direct evidence of how SGLT2 inhibition affects kidney function, the association of SGLT2 inhibitors with improved outcomes in heart failure and CKD implies a potential protective effect on kidney function. This is supported by the general understanding in the medical community that SGLT2 inhibitors can help reduce the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease and improve overall kidney health.\n\n4. **Need for Further Research**: Document 2 discusses IgA nephropathy and mentions the need for further research to establish prognostic factors in kidney disease. This highlights a gap in the literature regarding the specific mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors may affect kidney function, indicating that more studies are needed to clarify their role.\n\nIn summary, while the context documents suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors are increasingly used in the management of CKD and may have beneficial effects on kidney function, they do not provide detailed mechanisms or direct evidence of these effects. Further research is needed to fully understand how SGLT2 inhibition impacts kidney function specifically.",

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.",

The literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus, and the selected articles were evaluated for eligibility based on predefined criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale. Statistical analysis was performed to calculate effect sizes and assess heterogeneity among the studies. This review analyzed 29 out of 1,986 studies, conducted between 2005 and 2022, with participants from multiple countries. Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with age and gender, while associations with hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria were inconsistent. In the meta-analyses, a correlation between serum Gd-IgA1 and estimated glomerular filtration rate was identified, however, the relationships between Gd-IgA1 levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage and progression to kidney failure were inconsistent. Serum Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with validated prognostic risk factors, but were negatively correlated with kidney function. Further research in larger studies using standardized assays are needed to establish the value of Gd-IgA1 as a prognostic risk factor in IgAN. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40620-023-01874-8.",
          "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",
          "In recent years, advancements in immunosuppressive medications and post-transplant management have led to a significant decrease in acute rejection rates in renal allografts and consequent improvement in short-term graft survival. In contrast, recent data have shown an increased incidence of post-transplant glomerular diseases, which currently represent a leading cause of allograft loss. Although pathogenesis is not fully understood, growing evidence supports the role of inherited and immunological factors and has identified potential pre- and post-transplant predictors. In this review, we illustrate recent advancements in the pathogenesis of post-transplant glomerular disease and the role of risk factors and immunological triggers. In addition, we discuss potential prevention and management strategies.",

        "question": "What is the mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists?",
        "answer": "The context documents provide limited information specifically about the mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, based on the information available in Document 1, we can summarize the following aspects of their mechanism of action:\n\n1. **Glycemic Control**: GLP-1 receptor agonists enhance insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, which helps lower blood glucose levels. This is particularly beneficial for individuals with type 2 diabetes.\n\n2. **Weight Loss**: These agonists promote weight loss by reducing appetite and increasing satiety, which can be attributed to their effects on the central nervous system.\n\n3. **Slowing Gastric Emptying**: GLP-1 receptor agonists slow gastric emptying, which helps in lowering postprandial (after meal) glucose levels. This effect can be beneficial for managing blood sugar levels but may also pose risks, such as hypoglycemia, especially in patients who are on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy.\n\n4. **Cardiovascular and Renal Protection**: The document mentions that GLP-1-based therapies have beneficial effects beyond glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection, although the specific mechanisms for these effects are not detailed in the provided context.\n\n5. **Effects on Biliary Function**: GLP-1 receptor agonists may have effects on the gallbladder that contribute to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also carry a potential risk of biliary disease.\n\nOverall, while the context provides some insights into the actions of GLP-1 receptor agonists, it does not delve into the detailed molecular mechanisms or pathways involved in their action.

          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety.

The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included \u201cheart failure\u201d, \u201cccTGA\u201d, \u201cVAD\u201d, \u201cheart transplantation\u201d, and \u201csystemic RV failure\u201d. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.",

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan.

          "Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials."

While they discuss various anti-inflammatory agents and pathways, such as fucoxanthin's inhibition of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and Menisoxoisoaporphine A's interaction with phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) to modulate inflammatory responses, there is no mention of glucocorticoids or their specific mechanisms of action.\n\nTo comprehensively answer the question regarding how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation, additional information would be needed. Typically, glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects through several mechanisms, including:\n\n1. **Inhibition of Pro-inflammatory Cytokines**: Glucocorticoids can suppress the expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, by inhibiting their transcription.\n\n2. **Inhibition of NF-\u03baB Activation**: Similar to fucoxanthin, glucocorticoids can inhibit the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, which is crucial for the expression of many inflammatory genes.\n\n3. **Induction of Anti-inflammatory Proteins**: Glucocorticoids promote the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins, such as lipocortin-1, which inhibit phospholipase A2 and reduce the production of pro-inflammatory mediators.\n\n4. **Modulation of Immune Cell Function**: Glucocorticoids can alter the function of various immune cells, including macrophages and T cells, leading to reduced inflammation.\n\n5. **Inhibition of the NLRP3 Inflammasome**: While not explicitly mentioned in the context documents, glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, which plays a role in the inflammatory response.\n\nIn summary, while the context documents provide valuable insights into various anti-inflammatory mechanisms, they do not cover glucocorticoids specifically. Therefore, the information on glucocorticoid mechanisms is missing and would need to be sourced from additional literature on the topic.",

          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",
          "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.",
          "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood.

Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment.

          "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",

However, based on general knowledge, levodopa is a precursor to dopamine and is used in the treatment of PD to replenish the diminished levels of dopamine in the brain due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.\n\nLevodopa is converted into dopamine in the brain, which helps to alleviate the motor symptoms associated with PD, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. By increasing dopamine levels, levodopa helps to improve communication between the neurons in the basal ganglia, which are critical for coordinating movement.\n\nWhile the context documents discuss the use of levodopa in clinical studies and its combination with other treatments like metformin, they do not provide specific details about its pharmacological mechanism.

The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.",

SGLT2 inhibitors work by preventing the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, leading to increased glucose excretion and a reduction in blood glucose levels. This mechanism not only helps in glycemic control but also has several renal protective effects.\n\n1. **Reduction in Hyperfiltration**: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the hyperfiltration state often seen in diabetic nephropathy by lowering intraglomerular pressure, which can help preserve kidney function over time.\n\n2. **Decreased Progression of CKD**: Clinical studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors can slow the progression of CKD. They have been associated with a reduction in the risk of kidney failure and a decrease in the decline of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\n3. **Cardiovascular Benefits**: Since cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in CKD patients, the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors also indirectly support kidney health by reducing the risk of cardiovascular events that can exacerbate kidney function decline.\n\n4. **Reduction of Albuminuria**: SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce albuminuria, which is a marker of kidney damage. Lowering albumin levels in urine is associated with better kidney outcomes.\n\n5. **Improved Metabolic Parameters**: By improving glycemic control and reducing body weight, SGLT2 inhibitors can also positively impact metabolic parameters that are beneficial for kidney health.\n\nOverall, SGLT2 inhibitors represent a significant advancement in the management of both diabetes and CKD, providing renal protection and improving outcomes for patients with these conditions.",

We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded.

The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.",
          "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1- and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist tirzepatide (referred to here collectively as \u201cGLP-1-based therapy\u201d) are incretin-based therapies being used increasingly in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity. They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease. In this review, we summarize the effects of GLP-1 and incretin-based therapeutics on gastric, biliary and small intestinal function. An improved understanding of these effects will optimize the use of these drugs.",
          "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world. While the key elements are agreed upon, more research and global collaboration are needed to create consistent guidelines and improve patient outcomes.",

          "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings."

        "question": "How do statins prevent cardiovascular disease?",
        "answer": "Statins prevent cardiovascular disease primarily by lowering cholesterol levels in the blood, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which is often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol. They achieve this by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a central role in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in the liver. This reduction in cholesterol production leads to an increase in the uptake of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream, thereby lowering overall LDL levels.\n\nIn addition to their cholesterol-lowering effects, statins have several other beneficial effects that contribute to cardiovascular disease prevention:\n\n1. **Anti-inflammatory Effects**: Statins have been shown to reduce inflammation in the arterial walls, which is a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis (the buildup of plaques in arteries).\n\n2. **Stabilization of Atherosclerotic Plaques**: Statins help stabilize plaques in the arteries, making them less likely to rupture and cause heart attacks or strokes.\n\n3. **Improvement of Endothelial Function**: Statins enhance the function of the endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels), which can improve blood flow and reduce the risk of clot formation.\n\n4. **Reduction of Oxidative Stress**: Statins may decrease oxidative stress, which is associated with endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease.\n\n5. **Antithrombotic Effects**: Statins can reduce the risk of blood clot formation, further lowering the risk of cardiovascular events.\n\nOverall, by addressing multiple pathways involved in cardiovascular disease, statins play a crucial role in reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular complications.",

          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.",
          "Lipid droplets (LDs) serve as crucial hubs for lipid trafficking and metabolic regulation through their numerous interactions with various organelles. While the interplay between LDs and the Golgi apparatus has been recognized, their roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the role of Ras-related protein Rab-2A (Rab2A) in mediating LD-Golgi interactions, thereby contributing to very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipidation and secretion in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, our findings identify a selective interaction between Golgi-localized Rab2A and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) protein residing on LDs. This complex facilitates dynamic organelle communication between the Golgi apparatus and LDs, thus contributing to lipid transfer from LDs to the Golgi apparatus for VLDL2 lipidation and secretion. Attenuation of Rab2A activity via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses the Rab2A-HSD17B13 complex formation, impairing LD-Golgi interactions and subsequent VLDL secretion. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Rab2A and HSD17B13 in the liver reduces the serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Collectively, this study provides a new perspective on the interactions between the Golgi apparatus and LDs.",

To evaluate the 1-year risk of all-cause death, thromboembolic events, and bleeding in patients with AF-NAFLD. Retrospective study with a health research network (TriNetX). Patients with AF on oral anticoagulation (OAC) were categorized according to the presence of NAFLD into 2 groups. The primary outcomes were the 1-year risks of (1) a composite cardiovascular outcome (all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, and pulmonary embolism) and (2) a composite hemorrhagic outcome (intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding). Cox regression analysis before and after propensity score matching was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 95% CI,. Sensitivity analyses investigated the risk associated with cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and type of OAC (warfarin vs non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). We identified 22 636 patients with AF-NAFLD (69 \u00b1 12 years, 46.7% females) and 391 014 patients with AF and without liver disease (72 \u00b1 12 years, 42.7% females).

This was consistent also for all the single outcomes. Cirrhotic and thrombocytopenic patients with AF-NAFLD showed the highest risks. Compared to patients with AF-NAFLD on NOACs, those on warfarin were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular and hemorrhagic outcomes. In patients with AF, NAFLD is associated with a higher 1-year risk of adverse events, with the risk of adverse events progressively increasing from noncirrhotic to cirrhotic and from nonthrombocytopenic to thrombocytopenic patients.

The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included \u201cheart failure\u201d, \u201cccTGA\u201d, \u201cVAD\u201d, \u201cheart transplantation\u201d, and \u201csystemic RV failure\u201d. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.",

          "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",
          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",

          "Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases.

        "answer": "The mechanisms of antibiotic resistance can vary widely among different bacteria and can include several strategies:\n\n1. **Enzymatic Degradation or Modification**: Bacteria can produce enzymes that chemically modify or degrade antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. For example, beta-lactamases are enzymes that break down beta-lactam antibiotics.\n\n2. **Alteration of Target Sites**: Bacteria can modify the antibiotic's target site, reducing the drug's ability to bind effectively. This can occur through mutations in the genes encoding the target proteins.\n\n3. **Efflux Pumps**: Some bacteria possess efflux pumps that actively transport antibiotics out of the cell, decreasing the intracellular concentration of the drug and its effectiveness.\n\n4. **Reduced Permeability**: Changes in the bacterial cell membrane or cell wall can limit the entry of antibiotics into the cell, making it harder for the drug to reach its target.\n\n5. **Biofilm Formation**: Bacteria can form biofilms, which are protective layers that shield them from antibiotics and the immune system, making treatment more difficult.\n\n6. **Horizontal Gene Transfer**: Bacteria can acquire resistance genes from other bacteria through mechanisms such as transformation, transduction, or conjugation, spreading resistance traits within and between species.\n\n7. **Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR)**: Some bacteria can develop resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics, often through a combination of the mechanisms mentioned above.\n\nThese mechanisms contribute to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality.",

This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants\u2019 workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.",

For example:\n   - **Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors** block the action of IL-6, a cytokine that plays a significant role in inflammation and joint destruction. The study indicated that IL-6 inhibitors showed a high rate of symptom relief (78.2%) and lower deterioration in knee joint radiographs compared to other biologics.\n   - **Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitors** block TNF, another key cytokine in the inflammatory process. While they are effective, the study showed a lower symptom relief rate (65.8%) and higher deterioration in joint radiographs (21.9%) compared to IL-6 inhibitors.\n   - **Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors** interfere with the signaling pathways of various cytokines, leading to reduced inflammation and joint damage, with a symptom relief rate of 68.6%.\n   - **Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-Ig (CTLA4-Ig)** works by modulating T-cell activation, but it showed the lowest symptom relief rate (57.6%) and the highest deterioration in joint radiographs (25.9%).\n\n2. **Clinical Outcomes**: The use of biologics has been associated with significant improvements in symptoms, such as reduced swelling and tenderness in joints, as well as improved radiographic outcomes, indicating less joint damage over time.\n\n3. **Personalized Treatment**: The choice of biologic may depend on individual patient factors, including the specific characteristics of their RA, previous treatment responses, and the presence of comorbidities.\n\nOverall, biologics provide a targeted approach to managing rheumatoid arthritis, aiming to reduce inflammation, alleviate symptoms, and prevent joint damage.",

Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment.

The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut\u2010off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut\u2010off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut\u2010off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L).

        "answer": "Levodopa, also known as L-DOPA, is a precursor to dopamine and is used as a primary treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD, there is a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a deficiency of dopamine in the brain, which is responsible for the motor symptoms associated with the disease.\n\nThe mechanism of action of levodopa involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Conversion to Dopamine**: Once administered, levodopa crosses the blood-brain barrier and is taken up by the remaining dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Inside these neurons, levodopa is converted into dopamine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase.\n\n2. **Restoration of Dopamine Levels**: By increasing the levels of dopamine in the brain, levodopa helps to restore the balance of neurotransmitters that is disrupted in Parkinson's disease. This increase in dopamine levels alleviates motor symptoms such as bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, and tremors.\n\n3. **Symptomatic Relief**: The restored dopamine levels improve communication between the neurons in the basal ganglia, which is crucial for coordinating movement. As a result, patients experience improved motor function and a reduction in the severity of symptoms.\n\nIt is important to note that while levodopa is effective in managing symptoms, it does not halt or slow the progression of the disease itself. Over time, the effectiveness of levodopa may diminish, and patients may experience fluctuations in their response to the medication.",

We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL.

          "Cognitive impairment, a major determinant of poor functioning in schizophrenia, had limited responses to existing antipsychotic drugs. The limited efficacy could be due to regional differences in the dysregulation of the dopamine system. This study investigated striatal and peripheral dopaminergic makers in schizophrenia and their relationship with cognitive impairment. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated. We evaluated their cognitive performance, examined the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT, and measured plasma levels of dopaminergic precursors (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) that compete with precursors for brain uptake via ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Schizophrenia patients exhibited lower cognitive performance, decreased striatal DAT availability, and reduced levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA. Within the patient group, lower DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen was positively associated with attention deficits. Meanwhile, lower tyrosine levels and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA were positively related to executive dysfunction. Among all participants, DAT availability in the right CN or putamen was positively related to memory function, and plasma phenylalanine level was positively associated with executive function. This study supports the role of dopamine system abnormalities in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.

Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy.

This can help slow the progression of kidney disease.\n\n2. **Improved Glomerular Hemodynamics**: These medications can improve glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by reducing intraglomerular pressure, which may help protect the kidneys from damage.\n\n3. **Cardiorenal Benefits**: SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of heart failure and improve outcomes in patients with CKD, indicating a protective effect on both heart and kidney function.\n\n4. **Potential for Slowing CKD Progression**: Clinical trials have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors can slow the progression of CKD, making them a valuable treatment option for patients with diabetes and kidney disease.\n\nWhile the documents provided do not elaborate on these points, the general consensus in the medical literature supports the notion that SGLT2 inhibitors have a positive impact on kidney function, particularly in the context of diabetes and CKD.

          "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",

        "answer": "GLP-1 receptor agonists function primarily by mimicking the action of the endogenous hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Their mechanism of action includes several key effects:\n\n1. **Stimulation of Insulin Secretion**: GLP-1 receptor agonists enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells. This means that they promote insulin release when blood glucose levels are elevated, helping to lower blood sugar levels.\n\n2. **Inhibition of Glucagon Secretion**: These agonists also suppress the secretion of glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels. By inhibiting glucagon release, GLP-1 receptor agonists help to prevent the liver from producing and releasing more glucose into the bloodstream.\n\n3. **Slowing Gastric Emptying**: GLP-1 receptor agonists slow down gastric emptying, which helps to reduce the rate at which glucose enters the bloodstream after meals. This contributes to better postprandial (after eating) blood sugar control.\n\n4. **Promoting Satiety**: They also act on the central nervous system to promote feelings of fullness (satiety), which can lead to reduced food intake and weight loss, making them beneficial for managing obesity in addition to type 2 diabetes.\n\n5. **Cardiovascular Benefits**: Emerging evidence suggests that GLP-1 receptor agonists may have cardiovascular protective effects, although the exact mechanisms are still being studied.\n\nOverall, GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective in managing blood glucose levels and have additional benefits related to weight loss and cardiovascular health.",

          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety.

Therefore, I will provide a general overview based on established medical knowledge.\n\nACE inhibitors (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitors) play a crucial role in the management of heart failure. They work by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This action leads to several beneficial effects in heart failure patients:\n\n1. **Reduction of Afterload**: By decreasing the levels of angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors help to relax blood vessels, which reduces the resistance the heart has to work against (afterload). This can improve cardiac output and reduce the workload on the heart.\n\n2. **Decreased Preload**: ACE inhibitors also reduce the secretion of aldosterone, which decreases sodium and water retention. This helps to lower blood volume (preload), reducing the strain on the heart.\n\n3. **Improvement in Symptoms**: By alleviating symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue, ACE inhibitors can enhance the quality of life for patients with heart failure.\n\n4. **Mortality Benefit**: Numerous studies have shown that ACE inhibitors can improve survival rates in patients with heart failure, particularly those with reduced ejection fraction.\n\n5. **Prevention of Cardiac Remodeling**: ACE inhibitors can help prevent or reverse the remodeling of the heart that occurs in response to heart failure, which can lead to further deterioration of heart function.\n\nIn summary, while the documents provided do not specifically address ACE inhibitors, their role in heart failure is well-established in clinical practice, focusing on improving symptoms, reducing mortality, and preventing further cardiac damage.

This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials."

        "question": "How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?",
        "answer": "The provided documents do not specifically address how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation. However, based on general knowledge, glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones that play a crucial role in regulating inflammation and immune responses in the body.\n\nGlucocorticoids suppress inflammation through several mechanisms:\n\n1. **Inhibition of Pro-inflammatory Cytokines**: Glucocorticoids reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL-1, IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1). This helps to decrease the inflammatory response.\n\n2. **Suppression of Immune Cell Activation**: They inhibit the activation and proliferation of immune cells, including T cells and B cells, which are essential for the inflammatory response.\n\n3. **Induction of Anti-inflammatory Proteins**: Glucocorticoids promote the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins, such as lipocortin-1, which inhibit phospholipase A2 and subsequently reduce the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.\n\n4. **Inhibition of the NLRP3 Inflammasome**: While not directly mentioned in the documents, glucocorticoids can also inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key component in the inflammatory process, thereby reducing the release of inflammatory cytokines.\n\n5. **Modulation of Gene Expression**: Glucocorticoids bind to glucocorticoid receptors, which then translocate to the nucleus and modulate the expression of various genes involved in inflammation, leading to a net anti-inflammatory effect.\n\nIn summary, glucocorticoids suppress inflammation through a multifaceted approach that includes inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines, suppressing immune cell activation, inducing anti-inflammatory proteins, and modulating gene expression. The documents provided do not contain specific details on glucocorticoids, so this answer is based on established scientific understanding.",

          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",
          "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.",
          "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment.

          "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "question": "What are the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance?",
        "answer": "Antibiotic resistance occurs through several mechanisms that bacteria employ to survive exposure to antimicrobial agents. Based on the provided documents, the following mechanisms can be inferred:\n\n1. **Acquisition of Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs)**: Bacteria can acquire ARGs through horizontal gene transfer, which includes transformation, transduction, and conjugation. These genes can limit the susceptibility of bacteria to various antimicrobials, making them resistant. Document 3 highlights the importance of studying ARGs in different environments, including humans, livestock, and even less-explored areas like household dust.\n\n2. **Intrinsic Resistance**: Some bacteria possess inherent characteristics that make them resistant to certain antibiotics. This can include the natural lack of a target for the antibiotic or the presence of efflux pumps that expel the drug from the bacterial cell.\n\n3. **Modification of Drug Targets**: Bacteria can alter the target sites of antibiotics through mutations or enzymatic modifications, rendering the drugs ineffective. This is a common mechanism seen in various bacterial species.\n\n4. **Enzymatic Degradation or Modification of Antibiotics**: Bacteria can produce enzymes that chemically modify or degrade antibiotics, neutralizing their effects. For example, beta-lactamases are enzymes that break down beta-lactam antibiotics.\n\n5. **Biofilm Formation**: Bacteria can form biofilms, which are communities of bacteria encased in a protective matrix. This biofilm can shield the bacteria from the effects of antibiotics, making treatment more difficult.\n\n6. **Environmental Factors**: The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in various environments (as noted in Document 2) suggests that environmental factors, including the presence of antibiotics in wastewater or agricultural runoff, can contribute to the development and spread of resistance.\n\n7. **Multidrug Resistance**: Some bacteria, such as carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae mentioned in Document 1, can develop resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics, complicating treatment options and increasing the risk of severe infections.\n\nIn summary, antibiotic resistance is a multifaceted issue involving genetic, biochemical, and environmental factors. The documents indicate a growing concern regarding the prevalence of resistant strains and the need for ongoing research and new strategies to combat this public health challenge. However, the information provided is somewhat incomplete, and further details on specific mechanisms and examples would enhance the understanding of antibiotic resistance.",

A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.",

Machine learning has proven to be an important tool in this context. Numerous studies have investigated its potential for predicting yields under different conditions. Among these algorithms, Random Forest (RF) has gained prominence due to its ability to manage large data sets with high dimensions, as well as its ability to uncover complicated non-linear relationships and interactions between variables. RF is particularly suitable for scenarios with categorical variables and missing data. Given the complex web of management practices and their nonlinear effects on yield prediction, it is important to investigate new machine learning algorithms.

          "Wheat is a vital staple food crop, and its post-harvest storage is paramount to maintaining its quality. However, conventional grain storage methods frequently impede the ability to promptly and accurately predict and assess quality changes.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dual model system of \u201cprediction-evaluation\u201d, which integrates a dynamic quality prediction model based on SGCNiFormer with an evaluation framework based on K-Smeans clustering to establish a closed-loop mechanism from quality prediction to storage effect evaluation. The system incorporates a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a dynamic gating module, enabling precise simulation of the multidimensional evolution of wheat quality under the interaction of moisture and temperature. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SGCNiFormer in time-series prediction tasks, while the K-Smeans method establishes a wheat quality grading standard with physical interpretability. This integrated method provides a systematic theoretical framework for optimizing storage parameters and offers substantial support for intelligent grain storage management.",

The model integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) augmented with an improved attention mechanism and loss function, along with a Region-of-Interest (ROI) preprocessing algorithm to automate the marbling grading process. A dataset comprising 1300 beef sample images was collected and split into training and test sets at an 8:2 ratio. Comparative experiments were conducted with other deep learning models as well as ablation tests to validate the proposed model\u2019s effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved YOLOv8x achieves a validation accuracy of 99.93%, a practical grading accuracy of 97.82%, and a detection time of less than 0.5 s per image. The proposed algorithm enhances grading efficiency and contributes to intelligent agricultural practices and livestock product quality assessment."

Machine learning has proven to be an important tool in this context. Numerous studies have investigated its potential for predicting yields under different conditions. Among these algorithms, Random Forest (RF) has gained prominence due to its ability to manage large data sets with high dimensions, as well as its ability to uncover complicated non-linear relationships and interactions between variables. RF is particularly suitable for scenarios with categorical variables and missing data. Given the complex web of management practices and their nonlinear effects on yield prediction, it is important to investigate new machine learning algorithms. In this context, our study focused on the evaluation of gradient boosting methods, particularly Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), as potential candidates for yield estimation of the maize hybrid Zhengdan 958.

          "Wheat is a vital staple food crop, and its post-harvest storage is paramount to maintaining its quality. However, conventional grain storage methods frequently impede the ability to promptly and accurately predict and assess quality changes.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dual model system of \u201cprediction-evaluation\u201d, which integrates a dynamic quality prediction model based on SGCNiFormer with an evaluation framework based on K-Smeans clustering to establish a closed-loop mechanism from quality prediction to storage effect evaluation.

The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SGCNiFormer in time-series prediction tasks, while the K-Smeans method establishes a wheat quality grading standard with physical interpretability.

Furthermore, these hydrogels demonstrate superior conductivity, optical transparency, freezing tolerance, adhesion capability, and spontaneous mechanical and electrical self-healing. These unified functions render our hydrogel exceptional properties such as shape adaptability, skin-like perception, and energy harvesting capabilities. To demonstrate its potential applications, an artificial skin using our COMBIA hydrogel was configured for stimulus signal recording, which, as a promising soft electronics platform, could be used for next-generation human-machine interfaces.",
          "Wheat is a vital staple food crop, and its post-harvest storage is paramount to maintaining its quality. However, conventional grain storage methods frequently impede the ability to promptly and accurately predict and assess quality changes. Moreover, most storage systems are ineffective in dealing with the impact of temperature and humidity fluctuations on wheat quality, which can potentially lead to quality degradation during storage. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dual model system of \u201cprediction-evaluation\u201d, which integrates a dynamic quality prediction model based on SGCNiFormer with an evaluation framework based on K-Smeans clustering to establish a closed-loop mechanism from quality prediction to storage effect evaluation. The system incorporates a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a dynamic gating module, enabling precise simulation of the multidimensional evolution of wheat quality under the interaction of moisture and temperature. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SGCNiFormer in time-series prediction tasks, while the K-Smeans method establishes a wheat quality grading standard with physical interpretability. This integrated method provides a systematic theoretical framework for optimizing storage parameters and offers substantial support for intelligent grain storage management.",
          "Marbling is a crucial indicator that significantly impacts beef quality grading. Currently, Chinese beef processing enterprises rely on professional graders who visually assess marbling using national standard atlases. However, this manual evaluation method is highly subjective and time consuming. This study proposes a beef marbling grading algorithm based on an enhanced YOLOv8x model to address these challenges. The model integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) augmented with an improved attention mechanism and loss function, along with a Region-of-Interest (ROI) preprocessing algorithm to automate the marbling grading process. A dataset comprising 1300 beef sample images was collected and split into training and test sets at an 8:2 ratio. Comparative experiments were conducted with other deep learning models as well as ablation tests to validate the proposed model\u2019s effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved YOLOv8x achieves a validation accuracy of 99.93%, a practical grading accuracy of 97.82%, and a detection time of less than 0.5 s per image. The proposed algorithm enhances grading efficiency and contributes to intelligent agricultural practices and livestock product quality assessment."

          "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world. While the key elements are agreed upon, more research and global collaboration are needed to create consistent guidelines and improve patient outcomes.",

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

        "answer": "SGLT2 inhibitors, or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, have been shown to have beneficial effects on kidney function, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure. These medications work by preventing the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, leading to increased glucose excretion in urine and a reduction in blood glucose levels. \n\nThe effects of SGLT2 inhibition on kidney function include:\n\n1. **Reduction in Albuminuria**: SGLT2 inhibitors have been associated with a decrease in albuminuria, which is a marker of kidney damage. This reduction can help slow the progression of kidney disease.\n\n2. **Improvement in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)**: Initial studies have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors can lead to a modest increase in GFR, particularly in the early stages of treatment. Over time, they may help stabilize kidney function.\n\n3. **Cardiorenal Protection**: By improving hemodynamics and reducing the risk of heart failure, SGLT2 inhibitors can indirectly benefit kidney function. They help reduce the workload on the kidneys and improve overall renal perfusion.\n\n4. **Reduction in Progression to End-Stage Kidney Disease**: Long-term use of SGLT2 inhibitors has been linked to a lower risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in patients with CKD.\n\nOverall, SGLT2 inhibitors represent a significant advancement in the management of kidney disease, particularly for patients with diabetes and other risk factors for CKD. Their ability to improve kidney outcomes has led to expanded indications for their use in the elderly population and those with heart failure and CKD.",

This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases.

          "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",

Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety.

The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases.

          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",
          "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.",

MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",
          "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging."

        "answer": "The mechanisms of antibiotic resistance can vary widely among different bacteria, but some common mechanisms include:\n\n1. **Enzymatic Degradation**: Bacteria can produce enzymes that chemically modify or degrade antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. For example, beta-lactamases are enzymes that break down beta-lactam antibiotics.\n\n2. **Alteration of Target Sites**: Bacteria can modify the target sites of antibiotics, reducing the drug's ability to bind effectively. This can occur through mutations in the genes encoding the target proteins.\n\n3. **Efflux Pumps**: Some bacteria possess efflux pumps that actively transport antibiotics out of the cell, decreasing the intracellular concentration of the drug and its effectiveness.\n\n4. **Reduced Permeability**: Changes in the bacterial cell membrane or cell wall can limit the entry of antibiotics into the cell, making it harder for the drug to reach its target.\n\n5. **Biofilm Formation**: Bacteria can form biofilms, which are protective layers that shield them from the effects of antibiotics and the immune system.\n\n6. **Horizontal Gene Transfer**: Bacteria can acquire resistance genes from other bacteria through mechanisms such as transformation, transduction, or conjugation, spreading resistance traits within and between species.\n\nThese mechanisms contribute to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance, making infections harder to treat and increasing the need for new therapeutic strategies.",

A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR.

While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",

In contrast, recent data have shown an increased incidence of post-transplant glomerular diseases, which currently represent a leading cause of allograft loss. Although pathogenesis is not fully understood, growing evidence supports the role of inherited and immunological factors and has identified potential pre- and post-transplant predictors.

          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety.

The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials."

          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",
          "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.",
          "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.",
          "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",
          "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging."

        "answer": "Antibiotic resistance can occur through several mechanisms, including:\n\n1. **Enzymatic Degradation**: Bacteria can produce enzymes that chemically modify or degrade antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. For example, beta-lactamases are enzymes that break down beta-lactam antibiotics.\n\n2. **Alteration of Target Sites**: Bacteria can modify the target sites of antibiotics, preventing the drugs from binding effectively. This can occur through mutations in the genes encoding the target proteins.\n\n3. **Efflux Pumps**: Some bacteria possess efflux pumps that actively transport antibiotics out of the cell, reducing the intracellular concentration of the drug and its effectiveness.\n\n4. **Reduced Permeability**: Changes in the bacterial cell membrane or cell wall can decrease the uptake of antibiotics, making it harder for the drugs to enter the bacterial cell.\n\n5. **Biofilm Formation**: Bacteria can form biofilms, which are protective layers that shield them from antibiotics and the immune system, making treatment more difficult.\n\n6. **Horizontal Gene Transfer**: Bacteria can acquire resistance genes from other bacteria through mechanisms such as transformation, transduction, or conjugation, spreading resistance traits within and between species.\n\nThese mechanisms contribute to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance, posing significant challenges in treating infections effectively.",

In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR.

The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of \u22125.251 kcal/mol and \u22126.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients. In the arthritis mouse model, significantly reduced clinical and histological scores were observed in the UA treatment group.

We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020. We compared preoperative levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) between patients who suffered acute infection or not within 90\u2009days after surgery. The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut\u2010off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut\u2010off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut\u2010off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L). The neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%.

        "answer": "Levodopa, also known as L-DOPA, is a precursor to dopamine and is primarily used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) to alleviate motor symptoms. In PD, there is a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to decreased levels of dopamine in the brain. Levodopa works by crossing the blood-brain barrier and being converted into dopamine in the brain, thereby replenishing the depleted dopamine levels. This increase in dopamine helps to improve motor function and reduce symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slowness of movement). Levodopa is often administered in combination with carbidopa, which inhibits the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, allowing more levodopa to reach the brain and enhancing its effectiveness while reducing side effects.",
