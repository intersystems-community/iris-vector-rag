In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world.

Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.\", metadata={}, id='3292')",

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences.

          "Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', metadata={}, id='2494')",

The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.', metadata={}, id='2942')"

            "content": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world. While the key elements are agreed upon, more research and global collaboration are needed to create consistent guidelines and improve patient outcomes.",

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

            "content": "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",

            "content": "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.",

This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.",

The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.",

This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants\u2019 workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.",

The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut\u2010off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio, C\u2010reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020. We compared preoperative levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) between patients who suffered acute infection or not within 90\u2009days after surgery. The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut\u2010off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut\u2010off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut\u2010off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L). The neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%. The preoperative NLR shows some ability to predict acute infection after total joint arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Monitoring this ratio, perhaps in conjunction with other markers not analyzed here, may be useful for optimizing the timing of surgery in order to minimize risk of postoperative infection.",

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.",

            "content": "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",

            "title": "Modulation of the central nervous system immune response and neuroinflammation via Wnt signaling in health and neurodegenerative diseases",
            "content": "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.",

            "content": "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.",

            "content": "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",

The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging.

The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included \u201cheart failure\u201d, \u201cccTGA\u201d, \u201cVAD\u201d, \u201cheart transplantation\u201d, and \u201csystemic RV failure\u201d. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.",

            "content": "Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.",

Metformin works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity. It is part of the treatment regimen for type 2 diabetes along with lifestyle changes, oral medications, and in some cases, insulin therapy.\n\nDocument 2 mentions that the management of diabetes in the perioperative setting is complex, as glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. This indicates the importance of careful monitoring and adjustment of medication dosages, including metformin, in diabetic patients undergoing surgery.\n\nDocument 3 presents a case of a patient with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy who experienced severe and recurrent hypoglycemia.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

Glucocorticoids are a class of corticosteroids that have potent anti-inflammatory properties and are commonly used in the treatment of various inflammatory conditions. They work by binding to glucocorticoid receptors on immune cells, such as macrophages and T cells, and inhibiting the transcription of genes involved in the inflammatory response.\n\nSpecifically, glucocorticoids inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which are key mediators of inflammation. By reducing the levels of these pro-inflammatory molecules, glucocorticoids help to dampen the inflammatory response and alleviate symptoms of inflammation.\n\nIn addition to their direct effects on immune cells, glucocorticoids also modulate the activity of transcription factors involved in inflammation, such as NF-kB and AP-1. These transcription factors are responsible for activating genes that promote inflammation, and glucocorticoids inhibit their activity, further suppressing the inflammatory response.\n\nOverall, glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects by targeting multiple aspects of the immune response and inflammatory signaling pathways.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.42549756169319153, 'retrieval_method': 'knowledge_base_expansion'}, id='PMC1748704565')",

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells.

The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.4158058762550354, 'retrieval_method': 'initial_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC1748704682')",
          "Document(page_content='Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.399313747882843, 'retrieval_method': 'initial_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC11650366')"

Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.\", metadata={'title': 'Lipodystrophy With an Uncommon Clinical Presentation in a Patient With Insulin-Requiring Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus', 'similarity_score': 0.4415598213672638, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC11650328')",

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences.

Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.', metadata={'title': 'Bivalirudin for anticoagulation in elderly acute coronary syndrome: Effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse events', 'similarity_score': 0.41646406054496765, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC11736530_gen_142')",

Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', metadata={'title': 'The Regulation of the NF-\u03baB p65 and Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathways by Fucoxanthin in Human THP-1 Monocyte Macrophages Under a Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation Model', 'similarity_score': 0.4254975914955139, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC1748704565')",
          "Document(page_content=\"The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.\", metadata={'title': 'Modulation of the central nervous system immune response and neuroinflammation via Wnt signaling in health and neurodegenerative diseases', 'similarity_score': 0.3916708827018738, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC11649390')",

However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', metadata={'title': 'Menisoxoisoaporphine A, a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid from Menispermi Rhizoma, inhibits inflammation by targeting PDE4B', 'similarity_score': 0.35597896575927734, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC11649434')",

The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis.

Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with age and gender, while associations with hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria were inconsistent. In the meta-analyses, a correlation between serum Gd-IgA1 and estimated glomerular filtration rate was identified, however, the relationships between Gd-IgA1 levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage and progression to kidney failure were inconsistent. Serum Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with validated prognostic risk factors, but were negatively correlated with kidney function. Further research in larger studies using standardized assays are needed to establish the value of Gd-IgA1 as a prognostic risk factor in IgAN. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40620-023-01874-8.",

            "content": "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",

Notably, NLRP3 activation in neutrophils induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and neutrophil infiltration into the brain via CXCL1/2 secretion and subsequent activation of the CXCL1/2-CXCR2 signaling axis. Moreover, CXCL1 and CXCL2 in the inflamed brain directly reduced Claudin-5 expression, which regulates BBB permeability in brain endothelial cells.

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan.

            "content": "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.",

Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment.

One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging.

This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants\u2019 workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.",

The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of \u22125.251 kcal/mol and \u22126.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut\u2010off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio, C\u2010reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020. We compared preoperative levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) between patients who suffered acute infection or not within 90\u2009days after surgery. The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut\u2010off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut\u2010off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut\u2010off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L). The neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%. The preoperative NLR shows some ability to predict acute infection after total joint arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Monitoring this ratio, perhaps in conjunction with other markers not analyzed here, may be useful for optimizing the timing of surgery in order to minimize risk of postoperative infection.",

Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily for 3\u00a0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily and 500\u00a0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group).

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.",

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",

            "title": "Modulation of the central nervous system immune response and neuroinflammation via Wnt signaling in health and neurodegenerative diseases",
            "content": "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.",

            "content": "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.",

            "content": "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",

            "content": "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.",

            "content": "Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) remains a rare congenital disorder with a wide range of manifestations. The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included \u201cheart failure\u201d, \u201cccTGA\u201d, \u201cVAD\u201d, \u201cheart transplantation\u201d, and \u201csystemic RV failure\u201d. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.",

            "content": "Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.",

            "content": "Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.",
