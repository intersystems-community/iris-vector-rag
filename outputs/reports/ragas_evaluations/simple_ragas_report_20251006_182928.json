          "Perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to weight maintenance among young women: A community survey [Chunk 5]\n\nYoung women are a group at high risk of weight gain. This study examined a range of perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance among young women, and how these varied by socioeconomic status (SES), overweight status and domestic situation. In October-December 2001, a total of 445 women aged 18\u201332 years, selected randomly from the Australian electoral roll, completed a mailed self-report survey that included questions on 11 barriers to physical activity and 11 barriers to healthy eating (relating to personal, social and environmental factors). Height, weight and socio-demographic details were also obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost. Women with children were particularly likely to report a lack of social support as an important barrier to physical activity, and lack of social support and time as important barriers to healthy eating. Perceived barriers did not differ by SES or overweight status. Health promotion strategies aimed at preventing weight gain should take into account the specific perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating faced by women in this age group, particularly lack of motivation, lack of time, and cost. Strategies targeting perceived lack of time and lack of social support are particularly required for young women with children.\n\nliminary analyses and drafting of early results.

          "The B Cell Antigen Receptor and Overexpression of  [Chunk 3]\n\nA variety of circumstantial evidence from humans has implicated the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in the genesis of B cell lymphomas. We generated mouse models designed to test this possibility directly, and we found that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated state of a clonal BCR affected the rate and outcome of lymphomagenesis initiated by the proto-oncogene MYC. The tumors that arose in the presence of constitutive BCR differed from those initiated by MYC alone and resembled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (B-CLL), whereas those that arose in response to antigen stimulation resembled large B-cell lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma (BL). We linked the genesis of the BL-like tumors to antigen stimulus in three ways. First, in reconstruction experiments, stimulation of B cells by an autoantigen in the presence of overexpressed MYC gave rise to BL-like tumors that were, in turn, dependent on both MYC and the antigen for survival and proliferation. Second, genetic disruption of the pathway that mediates signaling from the BCR promptly killed cells of the BL-like tumors as well as the tumors resembling B-CLL. And third, growth of the murine BL could be inhibited by any of three distinctive immunosuppressants, in accord with the dependence of the tumors on antigen-induced signaling. Together, our results provide direct evidence that antigenic stimulation can participate in lymphomagenesis, point to a potential role for the constitutive BCR as well, and sustain the view that the constitutive BCR gives rise to signals different from those elicited by antigen. The mouse models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas, and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics.\n\nCR HEL cells into sHEL mice and introduced these into either wild-type or a second set of sHEL mice that were not treated with doxycycline. Donor cells again amplified rapidly in the sHEL mice, but not in wild-type recipients ( Figure 4 C). Tumors resulted in death of the recipient mice within 12\u201316 d, a latency appreciably shorter than that observed after the preceding transplantation (28\u201330 d). The flow cytometric profile of the donor cells changed after their encounter with antigen. The donor cells expressed B220, BCR HEL , CD19, CD21, and CD23, but did not express CD69 or B7\u20132 on their surface. The cells that resulted from the expansion following antigenic stimulation in vivo showed a loss of CD23 expression and high levels of CD69 and B7\u20132 expression (unpublished data). The same phenotype was observed with the cells that had expanded following the second transplantation into sHEL recipient mice. This phenotype is typical of antigen-activated B cells. In addition, it is similar to what we initially observed in the cells from tumors that arose in the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice and, thus, also resembles the phenotype of BL ( Table 1 ). We conclude that the appearance and expansion of HEL-specific, BL-like tumor cells in the recipient mice were dependent on stimulation by the cognate antigen. In contrast to the preceding findings, tumor cells obtained from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice or MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice would grow into lethal tumors when transplanted into recipient mice in the absence of HEL antigen ( Figure 4 A, 4 C, and 4F). We postulated that this seeming independence of antigen was due to the intrinsic production of antigen by the tumor cells themselves, as would be expected from the genotype of the cells. That proved to be the case. We were able to detect HEL transcripts and HEL protein in cells obtained from either a primary E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor or an MMTV-TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor, but not in cells obtained from either E\u03bc- MYC or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors (unpublished data). Similarly, we found HEL protein in tumors that arose following transplantation of cells from a primary E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor. We conclude that the murine BL cells are in fact antigen-dependent, but can be sustained by either autocrine or paracrine stimulus. To further test the role of antigen stimulation in the genesis of the B-CLL\u2013 and BL-like tumors, we disrupted the molecular machinery that generates and transmits signals from the BCR. By transduction of suitable interfering RNAs into established tumor cells, we were able to suppress the expression of the Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 signaling chains of the BCR. We have previously shown that these shRNA sequences targeting Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 lead to substantial reduction in the levels of Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 protein in K46\u03bc B cells, respectively [ 33 ]. We have observed that shRNAs directed at either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 individually caused a decrease in the levels of surface IgM in transduced B cells. Importantly, the expression of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 on the cell surface modulates the surface expression of IgH and IgL, the antigen-specific components of the BCR. The vector used for transduction was a lentivirus that has been previously described [ 34 ]. The viruses tested in vitro and in vivo were the parental vector encoding either GFP (pLL3.7) or Thy1.1 (pLL3.77) as a reporter gene, and variants encoding both a reporter gene and shRNAs for either Ig\u03b1, Ig\u03b2, or firefly luciferase, the last as a negative control. Transduction was performed with tumor cells isolated from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice. The rates of transduction varied between 5%\u201350% of the tumor cells ( Figure 5 A). The cells were then maintained in culture and evaluated on a daily basis for reporter gene expression. (A) Cell lines were generated from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors and designated as DBL114, or from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors and designated TBL-1. These cell lines uniformly express B220 and IgM on their surface. To determine whether the shRNA sequences targeting Ig\u03b1 were able to knock down their target protein, we measured the levels of IgM expressed on the surface of DBL-114 cells that were transduced with lentiviral constructs that encode a reporter gene ( GFP ). The expression of IgM on the surface is co-modulated with Ig\u03b1 expression, hence the loss of Ig\u03b1 should reduce the levels of surface IgM. The panels represent the flow cytometric profile of the DBL-114 cells that had been transduced with the parental virus (pLL3.7), or a variant that encodes an shRNA specific for firefly luciferase, as a negative control, or two variants of pLL3.7 that encode different shRNAs specific for Ig\u03b1. The GFP-positive cells in the panels that contained shRNAs specific for Ig\u03b1 showed a loss of surface IgM expression. This is not the case for the GFP-negative fraction of the same cell populations. Similar results were obtained in TBL-1 cells (unpublished data). (B) The shRNA-mediated knock-down of Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 in cells obtained from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors confers a competitive disadvantage on those cells in vitro, compared to their nontransduced counterparts. Single-cell suspensions were generated from the respective tumors, and used for lentiviral transductions. The cells were maintained in cultured and assayed for GFP expression, by flow cytometry every 24 h. The data for the GFP+ fraction in the population of cells harboring a lentivirus encoding and shRNA was divided by the fraction of GFP+ cells in the population of cells that was transduced with the parental vector, in order to standardize the values and examine the rates of change from the starting level of GFP+ cells, as previously reported [ 104 ]. The cells that were transduced with lentiviruses encoding shRNAs specific for either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 exhibited a significant competitive disadvantage when compared to the cells harboring lentiviruses encoding shRNAs specific for firefly luciferase. All wells were set up in triplicates. The graphs represent data from one experiment, representative of eight independent experiments. (C) In vivo validation of the effects of Ig\u03b1-specific shRNAs on the maintenance of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors. Cells were obtained from E\u03bc-MYC/BCR HEL tumors, and transduced in vitro with pLL3.77-sh.luciferase (uses thy1.1 as a reporter gene) or pLL3.7-sh.Ig\u03b1.1 (uses GFP as a reporter gene). The different cell populations were then mixed in order to generate mixtures of cells that contained an approximately equal fraction of cells that harbored the control lentivirus (pLL3.77.sh.luciferase) and the experimental lentivirus (pLL3.7.sh.Ig\u03b1). The mixtures of cells were transplanted into cohorts of Rag-1 \u2013/\u2013 mice. The mice were observed daily until they exhibited externally evident signs of lymphoma, and the organs were harvested. The graphs represent the fraction of cells in the tumorous lymph nodes that retained expression of either thy1.1 (for the control lentivirus), or GFP (for the Ig\u03b1-specific lentivirus. These results confirm the requirement for Ig\u03b1 expression in the maintenance of the murine BCLs. We observed that for both E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, the percentage of cells transduced with either the parental lentivirus, or the variant that encoded shRNA specific to firefly luciferase, did not change appreciably during a 14 day period ( Figure 5 B). In contrast, each of the cultures that was transduced with a lentiviral variant that encoded shRNAs specific to either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 displayed a significant decrease in the frequency of the cells expressing the reporter gene ( Figure 5 B). The same pattern was observed with two independent shRNAs for each of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2. This in vitro competition assay suggested that loss of signaling from the BCR placed the tumor cells at a significant disadvantage when compared to their counterparts that had retained normal signaling from the BCR."

          "Antitumor effects of two bisdioxopiperazines against two experimental lung cancer models  [Chunk 1]\n\nProbimane (Pro), an anti-cancer agent originating in China, was derived from razoxane (ICRF-159, Raz), a drug created in Britain, specifically targeting at cancer metastasis and as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines. Pro and Raz are bisdioxopiperazine compounds. In this work, we evaluated the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of Pro and Raz in vivo against two lung tumor models, one of murine origin (Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC) and one of human origin (LAX-83). After determining the lethal dosage of Pro and Raz, we assessed and compared the inhibitory effects of Pro and Raz against primary tumor growth and metastatic occurrences of LLC at the dosage of LD5. Pro and Raz were active against primary tumor growth and significantly inhibited pulmonary metastasis of LLC at same dose-ranges (inhibitory rates > 90 %). Both Raz and Pro were effective in 1, 5, and 9 day administration schedules. Three different schedules of Raz and Pro were effective against the primary tumor growth of LLC (35\u201350 %). The synergistic anticancer effect of Raz with bleomycin (Ble) (from 41.3 % to 73.3 %) was more obvious than those with daunorubicin (Dau) (from 33.1 % to 56.3 %) in the LLC tumor model. Pro was also seen to have synergistic anti-cancer effects with Ble in the LLC model. Both Raz and Pro inhibited the growth of LAX 83 in a statistically significant manner. These data suggest that both Raz and Pro may have anti-tumor potentiality and Raz and Pro have combinative effects with Ble or Dau. The potential targets of bisdioxopiperazines may include lung cancers, especially on tumor metastasis. The anti-cancer effects of Raz and Pro can be increased with the help of other anticancer drugs.\n\nObvious necrosis in tumor tissues was observed by histological evaluation of CTX and Pro treatment groups, but Pro showed larger vacuoles than CTX . Drug inhibition on tumor volumes were calculated and outlined in Table 8 . We have tested the 5 most commonly used anticancer drugs \u2013 cyclophosphamide (CTX), 5-fluoruoracil (5-Fu), methotrexate (MTX), cisplatin (DDP) and vincristine (VCR) (Table 9 ). In the LAX-83 model, CTX has been shown to be the most effective one. The anticancer effect of Pro was the same or better than those of MTX, DDP and as well as 5-Fu against LAX-83 tumor growth. Antitumor activities of Pro and Raz on human tumor LAX-83 using subrenal capsule assay: Route: ip \u00d7 5 daily from the day after surgery. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.001 (treatment vs vehicle control). Experiment was completed within 7 days. Tumor volume = 1/2 \u00d7 width 2 \u00d7 length (using T-test) Antitumor activities of anticancer drugs on human tumor LAX-83 using subrenal capsule assay: Route: ip \u00d7 5 daily from the day after surgery. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.001 (treatment vs vehicle control). Experiment was completed within 7 days. Tumor volume = 1/2 \u00d7 width 2 \u00d7 length (using T-test) Explanations of anticancer and antimetastatic mechanisms of bisdioxopiperazines are now inconclusive. The present explanation for the anticancer mechanisms of Raz has been attributed to antiangiogenesis and topoisomerase II inhibition.[ 16 ] Since the antimetastatic activities of Raz and Pro were much stronger than those actions against primary tumor growth, this special targeting on metastasis ought to be more useful in clinical cancer treatment. Raz and Pro show typical characteristics of antiangiogenesis agents, which target small nodule of tumors. Meanwhile, recent reports on drugs targeting angiogenesis indicate that most anti-vascular drugs have low or even no effects on most cancers when they are used alone in clinics, but they show synergistic effects in combination with other anticancer drugs. [ 17 , 18 ] Our study shows synergistic anticancer actions of Raz and Pro with Ble or Dau basing on this theory. Previous work showed that Pro and Raz could reduce the cardiotoxicity of anthrocycline ,[ 1 , 9 , 10 ] so we may reasonably deduce that they can also reduce the cytotoxicity of anthrocyclines . The data in our study suggests that the synergistic effects of Raz with anthrocyclines are present, but not as potent as those with Ble . Since we have tested the antitumor activity of clinically available anticancer drugs (CTX, 5-Fu, MTX, DDP and VCR) against LAX-83, CTX being the best one, two bisdioxopiperazines studied on this work show overall similar anticancer effective as commonly used drugs. Although the anticancer effects of CTX and VCR are better than those of Pro, for other commonly used drugs, such as DDP, MTX and 5-Fu, the antitumor effects are no better than those of Pro. Since the antitumor effects of MTX and DDP are even less effective than those of Pro and Raz , we suggest that anticancer effects of Pro and Raz are within the effective anticancer ranges of commonly available anticancer drugs. The other useful property of Pro is that it is the most water-soluble among the bisdioxopiperazines . Most bisdioxopiperazines are less water-soluble and given orally in clinics. Although oral administration is easy for patients, bioavailability varies from patient to patient. For some patients who have a poor absorption of bisdioxopiperazines in oral administration, Pro can be injected iv to maintain stable drug levels. Our previous work showed that Pro could strongly accumulate in tumor tissue while Pro levels in other tissues decrease rapidly [ 19 ]. Presently, a stereo-isomer of Raz , (dexrazoxane, ICRF-187 ), a water-soluble Raz, is being reinvestigated and has aroused the interests of clinical oncologists. Phase III clinical studies are currently underway in the US. More importantly, ICRF-187 was licensed in 28 countries in 4 continents. This work shows a noticeable inhibition of Pro and Raz on lung cancers and suggests possible usage of Raz and Pro on lung cancer in clinics. The advantages of bisdioxopiperazines in clinical treatment of lung cancers are as follows: (i) Pro and Raz can inhibit the growth of lung cancers, with and without the help of other anticancer drugs, like Dau and Ble ; (ii) like Raz , Pro strongly inhibits spontaneous pulmonary metastasis of LLC ; (iii) since Pro can inhibit CaM [ 11 ], a calcium activated protein that's associated with MDR and metastatic phenotypes, synergistic anticancer effects of Pro and Raz can be expected in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, like Dau or Ble . Now, new concepts of the relationship between tumor metastasis and MDR in cancers have been stated,[ 20 ] whereas bisdioxopiperazines can inhibit both tumor metastasis and MDR . As a counterpart of Raz , Pro might be of interest and have chemotherapeutic potential in clinics. Cyclophosphomide ( CTX ), daunorubicin ( Dau ) and bleomycin ( Ble ), 5-fluororacil (5-Fu), vincristine (VCR), cisplatin (DDP), methotrexate (MTX) were purchased from Shanghai Pharmaceutical Company. Pro and Raz were prepared by Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Nude mice (Swiss-DF), taken from Roswell Park Memorial Institute, USA, were bred in Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences under a specific pathogen free condition. Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma xenograft ( LAX-83 )[ 21 ] and Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) were serially transplanted in this laboratory. All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Research Animals, NIH, established by Washington University's Animal Studies Committee. Bouin's solution consists of water saturated with picric acid: formaldehyde: glacial acetic acid (75: 20: 5, v/v/v). Mice of Kun-Min strain (equal amount of male and female) were ip injected with Pro and Raz daily for 10 successive days. The deaths of mice were counted after 1 month. Lethal dosage of agents was calculated by Random Probity tests . C57BL/6J mice were implanted sc with LLC (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) from donor mice. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs daily or every two days for 7 injections. On day 11 or day 20, mice were sacrificed, and locally growing tumors were separated from skin and muscles and weighed, and lungs of host mice were placed into a Bouin's solution for 24 h, and then the lung samples were submerged into a solution of 95 % alcohol for 24 h. Finally, the numbers of extruding metastatic foci in lungs were counted. C57BL/6J mice were implanted sc with LLC (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) from donor mice. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs on day 1, 5, 9. Single injection or 3 injections every 3 hours were used. Tumors were separated and weighed on day 11. Nude mice were inoculated with LAX-83 under the renal capsule (SRC method).[ 22 ] Nude mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs daily during next five days after inoculation of LAX-83 . Then nude mice were sacrificed, and their kidneys were taken out for measurement of tumor sizes using a stereomicroscope a week after transplantation. Tumor volume was calculated as 1/2(ab 2 ) where a and b are their major and minor axes of the lump. Kidneys with tumors were paraffin-embedded, sliced and hematoxylin dyed. The tumor tissues were then observed from a light microscope. Student's t-test was used to assess the differences between control and drug treatment groups of above methods.

          "Antitumor effects of two bisdioxopiperazines against two experimental lung cancer models  [Chunk 0]\n\nProbimane (Pro), an anti-cancer agent originating in China, was derived from razoxane (ICRF-159, Raz), a drug created in Britain, specifically targeting at cancer metastasis and as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines. Pro and Raz are bisdioxopiperazine compounds. In this work, we evaluated the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of Pro and Raz in vivo against two lung tumor models, one of murine origin (Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC) and one of human origin (LAX-83). After determining the lethal dosage of Pro and Raz, we assessed and compared the inhibitory effects of Pro and Raz against primary tumor growth and metastatic occurrences of LLC at the dosage of LD5. Pro and Raz were active against primary tumor growth and significantly inhibited pulmonary metastasis of LLC at same dose-ranges (inhibitory rates > 90 %). Both Raz and Pro were effective in 1, 5, and 9 day administration schedules. Three different schedules of Raz and Pro were effective against the primary tumor growth of LLC (35\u201350 %). The synergistic anticancer effect of Raz with bleomycin (Ble) (from 41.3 % to 73.3 %) was more obvious than those with daunorubicin (Dau) (from 33.1 % to 56.3 %) in the LLC tumor model. Pro was also seen to have synergistic anti-cancer effects with Ble in the LLC model. Both Raz and Pro inhibited the growth of LAX 83 in a statistically significant manner. These data suggest that both Raz and Pro may have anti-tumor potentiality and Raz and Pro have combinative effects with Ble or Dau. The potential targets of bisdioxopiperazines may include lung cancers, especially on tumor metastasis. The anti-cancer effects of Raz and Pro can be increased with the help of other anticancer drugs.\n\nAntitumor effects of two bisdioxopiperazines against two experimental lung cancer models \n\nProbimane (Pro), an anti-cancer agent originating in China, was derived from razoxane (ICRF-159, Raz), a drug created in Britain, specifically targeting at cancer metastasis and as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines.

The potential targets of bisdioxopiperazines may include lung cancers, especially on tumor metastasis. The anti-cancer effects of Raz and Pro can be increased with the help of other anticancer drugs.\n\nRazoxane (ICRF-159) ( Raz ), first developed in UK, was the earliest agent against spontaneous metastasis for the murine model (Lewis lung carcinoma) in 1969 [ 1 ]. A large volume of papers and projects have been published in the utilities and mechanisms of Raz for anticancer actions, like assisting radiotherapy, [ 2 ] overcoming multi-drug resistance (MDR) of daunorubicin and doxorubicin [ 3 ], inhibiting topoisomerase II [ 4 ] and so on. More importantly, Raz , as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines, has been licensed in 28 countries in 4 continents. Since morpholine groups in some structures were reported to be responsible for cytotoxic or modulative actions on tumors, an anticancer agent, probimane [1,2-bis (N 4 -morpholine-3, 5-dioxopeprazine-1-yl) propane; AT-2153, Pro] was synthesized by introducing two morpholine groups into Raz in China.[ 5 ]. Raz and Pro belong to bisdiopiperazines . Like Raz , Pro also exhibits anti-tumor activity both in vivo and in vitro against experimental tumor models in a small scale investigation [ 6 , 7 ] and limited clinical data showed that Pro could inhibit human malignant lymphoma even for those resistant to other anticancer drugs [ 8 ]. Pro exhibits the same pharmacological effects as Raz , like detoxication of Adriamycin ( ADR ) induced cardiotoxicities, and synergism with ADR against tumors [ 9 , 10 ]. We have found some novel biological effects of Pro , like inhibiting the activity of calmodulin ( CaM ), a cell-signal regulator, which can explain anticancer actions and the combined cytotoxic effect of Pro and ADR [ 11 ]. Pro was also shown to inhibit lipoperoxidation ( LPO ) of erythrocytes [ 12 ], influence tumor sialic acid synthesis [ 13 ] and inhibit the binding of fibrinogen to leukemia cells [ 14 ]. Lung cancer is the No 1 killer among all categories of cancers in urban areas in China and many Western countries. The high mortality rate of lung cancer can easily be caused by inducing multi-drug resistance ( MDR ) and by high metastatic occurrence in clinics [ 15 ]. Since we assume that Pro , like Raz may possess useful therapeutic potentialities, we evaluated in vivo the chemotherapeutical parameters of Pro and Raz for lung cancer of both murine and human origins. The lethal dosage of Pro and Raz is tabulated in Table 1 . Since the toxicity of Pro and Raz seemed to lack sex specificity in mice, we were able to combine their numbers for LD 50 and LD 5 calculations. We used the approximate dosage of LD 5 of Pro (60 mg/kg ip \u00d7 7) and Raz (20 mg/kg ip \u00d7 7) as equitoxic dosages for further treatment studies. The subacute toxicity of Pro and Raz in mice: Mouse survival was observed for 1 month. The numbers of mice in each group were 20 for each of the 5 dosages of a single agent. Antitumor and antimetastatic effects of Pro and Raz on LLC are tabulated in Table 2 and Table 3 . Pro and Raz at equitoxic dosages (LD 5 ) showed a noticeable anticancer effect on primary tumor growth (inhibitory rates, approximately 30\u201345 %), and significantly inhibited the formation of tumor metastases (inhibitory rates on pulmonary metastasis > 90 %, P < 0.001). Primary tumor growth of LLC was inhibited more by Pro (48 %) than by Raz (40.3%) in a 20 day trial, whereas the inhibition of Pro (35.7%) was slightly less than that of Raz (40 %) on an 11 day trial. Pro seems to be more persistent than Raz in inhibiting primary tumor growth of LLC . Antitumor effects of Raz and Pro on LLC are included in Table 4 , 5 , 6 . We evaluated 1, 5 and 9 day administration schedules in our study. We found that Raz and Pro were effective in a statistically significant manner with the 3 injection schedule of the 1, 5 and 9 day administrations on LLC . If we administered Raz to tumor-bearing mice once on day 1, 5 and 9, there was no difference between treatment and vehicle control. Antitumor effects of Raz in combination with Ble on LLC (73.3 %) were better than those in combination with Dau (56.3 %) (Table 5 and Table 6 ). Pro also showed synergistic effects in combination with Ble (Table 7 ). The influence of Pro and Raz on primary tumor of LLC (using Student T-test): Route: ip \u00d7 7 daily. Experiment term was 11 days. * P < 0.05 (treatment vs vehicle control). The numbers of mice were 30 for the control group and 20 for each treatment group. 100 % survival was observed in each group. The influence of Pro and Raz on primary and metastatic tumor of LLC: PTI (%) \u2013 Primary tumor inhibition. MFCPM \u2013 metastatic foci count per mouse. Route: ip \u00d7 7 every 2 days. Experiment term was 20 days, * P < 0.001(treatment vs vehicle control). The numbers of mice were 30 for both control group and each treatment group. 100 % survival was observed in each group.

Experimental term was 11 days Antitumor effects of Pro on Lewis lung carcinoma in combination with daunorubicin or bleomycin: *Administration every 3 hours. Experimental term was 11 days The experiments showed that LAX-83 was sensitive to Raz (40\u201360 mgKg -1 , ip \u00d7 5) and Pro (80\u2013100 mgKg -1 ip \u00d7 5) with inhibitory rates of 25\u201332 % and 55\u201360 % respectively (P < 0.01 vs control). CTX , as a positive anticancer drug (40 mgKg -1 ip \u00d7 5), exhibited antitumor activities against the growth of LAX-83 with an inhibitory rate of 84 %. Obvious necrosis in tumor tissues was observed by histological evaluation of CTX and Pro treatment groups, but Pro showed larger vacuoles than CTX . Drug inhibition on tumor volumes were calculated and outlined in Table 8 . We have tested the 5 most commonly used anticancer drugs \u2013 cyclophosphamide (CTX), 5-fluoruoracil (5-Fu), methotrexate (MTX), cisplatin (DDP) and vincristine (VCR) (Table 9 ).",

Experiment was completed within 7 days. Tumor volume = 1/2 \u00d7 width 2 \u00d7 length (using T-test) Explanations of anticancer and antimetastatic mechanisms of bisdioxopiperazines are now inconclusive. The present explanation for the anticancer mechanisms of Raz has been attributed to antiangiogenesis and topoisomerase II inhibition.[ 16 ] Since the antimetastatic activities of Raz and Pro were much stronger than those actions against primary tumor growth, this special targeting on metastasis ought to be more useful in clinical cancer treatment. Raz and Pro show typical characteristics of antiangiogenesis agents, which target small nodule of tumors. Meanwhile, recent reports on drugs targeting angiogenesis indicate that most anti-vascular drugs have low or even no effects on most cancers when they are used alone in clinics, but they show synergistic effects in combination with other anticancer drugs. [ 17 , 18 ] Our study shows synergistic anticancer actions of Raz and Pro with Ble or Dau basing on this theory. Previous work showed that Pro and Raz could reduce the cardiotoxicity of anthrocycline ,[ 1 , 9 , 10 ] so we may reasonably deduce that they can also reduce the cytotoxicity of anthrocyclines . The data in our study suggests that the synergistic effects of Raz with anthrocyclines are present, but not as potent as those with Ble . Since we have tested the antitumor activity of clinically available anticancer drugs (CTX, 5-Fu, MTX, DDP and VCR) against LAX-83, CTX being the best one, two bisdioxopiperazines studied on this work show overall similar anticancer effective as commonly used drugs. Although the anticancer effects of CTX and VCR are better than those of Pro, for other commonly used drugs, such as DDP, MTX and 5-Fu, the antitumor effects are no better than those of Pro. Since the antitumor effects of MTX and DDP are even less effective than those of Pro and Raz , we suggest that anticancer effects of Pro and Raz are within the effective anticancer ranges of commonly available anticancer drugs. The other useful property of Pro is that it is the most water-soluble among the bisdioxopiperazines . Most bisdioxopiperazines are less water-soluble and given orally in clinics. Although oral administration is easy for patients, bioavailability varies from patient to patient. For some patients who have a poor absorption of bisdioxopiperazines in oral administration, Pro can be injected iv to maintain stable drug levels. Our previous work showed that Pro could strongly accumulate in tumor tissue while Pro levels in other tissues decrease rapidly [ 19 ]. Presently, a stereo-isomer of Raz , (dexrazoxane, ICRF-187 ), a water-soluble Raz, is being reinvestigated and has aroused the interests of clinical oncologists. Phase III clinical studies are currently underway in the US. More importantly, ICRF-187 was licensed in 28 countries in 4 continents. This work shows a noticeable inhibition of Pro and Raz on lung cancers and suggests possible usage of Raz and Pro on lung cancer in clinics. The advantages of bisdioxopiperazines in clinical treatment of lung cancers are as follows: (i) Pro and Raz can inhibit the growth of lung cancers, with and without the help of other anticancer drugs, like Dau and Ble ; (ii) like Raz , Pro strongly inhibits spontaneous pulmonary metastasis of LLC ; (iii) since Pro can inhibit CaM [ 11 ], a calcium activated protein that's associated with MDR and metastatic phenotypes, synergistic anticancer effects of Pro and Raz can be expected in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, like Dau or Ble . Now, new concepts of the relationship between tumor metastasis and MDR in cancers have been stated,[ 20 ] whereas bisdioxopiperazines can inhibit both tumor metastasis and MDR . As a counterpart of Raz , Pro might be of interest and have chemotherapeutic potential in clinics. Cyclophosphomide ( CTX ), daunorubicin ( Dau ) and bleomycin ( Ble ), 5-fluororacil (5-Fu), vincristine (VCR), cisplatin (DDP), methotrexate (MTX) were purchased from Shanghai Pharmaceutical Company.

          "Loss of Robustness and Addiction to IGF1 during Early Keratinocyte Transformation by Human Papilloma Virus 16 [Chunk 2]\n\nInfection of keratinocytes with high risk human Papilloma virus causes immortalization, and when followed by further mutations, leads to cervical cancer and other anogenital tumors. Here we monitor the progressive loss of robustness in an in vitro model of the early stages of transformation that comprises normal keratinocytes and progressive passages of HPV16 immortalized cells. As transformation progresses, the cells acquire higher proliferation rates and gain the ability to grow in soft agar. Concurrently, the cells lose robustness, becoming more sensitive to serum starvation and DNA damage by Cisplatin. Loss of robustness in the course of transformation correlates with significant reductions in the activities of the anti-apoptotic proteins PKB/Akt, Erk, Jnk and p38 both under normal growth conditions and upon stress. In parallel, loss of robustness is manifested by the shrinkage of the number of growth factors that can rescue starving cells from apoptosis, with the emergence of dependence solely on IGF1. Treatment with IGF1 activates PKB/Akt and Jnk and through them inhibits p53, rescuing the cells from starvation. We conclude that transformation in this model induces higher susceptibility of cells to stress due to reduced anti-apoptotic signaling and hyper-activation of p53 upon stress.\n\n24 h serum starvation and reaction of the blots with anti-PARP antibody showed that cells died via apoptosis. In primary keratinocytes, which were not affected by starvation, PARP was not cleaved. PARP was clearly cleaved upon starvation of early HF1 cells and even more dramatically in late HF1 cells ( Figure 2B ). We also immuno-stained cytochrome C to monitor its release from the mitochondria. We already detected cytochrome C release after 12 h of starvation in late HF1 cells, but not in primary keratinocytes or early HF1 cells, which are more resistant to the stress ( Figure 2C ). In order to see whether the increased sensitivity to stress was a more general phenomenon or restricted to starvation, we exposed the cells to the DNA damaging agent, Cisplatin. Cisplatin treatment induced cell death in all three cell types and again, sensitivity increased with transformation ( Figure 2D ). Treatment with 20 \u00b5M Cisplatin for 48 h induced 35% death of normal keratinocytes, 50% death of early HF1 and \u223c80% death of late HF1 cells. A. Cells were serum starved (white) or untreated (black) for 48 h. After treatment, cells were fixed, stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. The sub-G1 fraction of the cells was quantified as a measure of cell death. Error bars represent the standard error of three independent experiments. B. Representative western blot of cells after 24 h starvation. PARP cleavage reflects caspase activation during apoptosis. Tubulin serves as a loading control. C. Immuno-staining of cytochrome C after 12 h serum starvation (Bar = 15 \u00b5m). D. Cells were treated with 20 \u00b5M Cisplatin for 48 h, fixed and analyzed as in A. Error bars represent the standard error of three independent experiments. These experiments show a clear increase in sensitivity to stress as a result of cell immortalization and in vitro passaging. Stress induced faster activation of mitochondrial apoptosis, which results in caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. The fact that only HF1 cells, but not the primary keratinocytes, were sensitive to serum starvation provided a convenient, clear-cut system for further analysis. We therefore concentrated our studies on the response of HF1 cells to serum starvation. It has been shown that expression of the E6 or E7 genes of HPV often increases stress sensitivity [14] \u2013 [17] . Since transformation in our system initiated with HPV16 transfection, we examined the expression of the viral genes and their targets, p53 and Rb, to see whether the increased stress sensitivity could be attributed to their expression. Since there are no efficient antibodies against E6, and the E6 and E7 genes are co-regulated, E7 expression is a valid indicator for viral gene expression. The E7 protein was very highly expressed in early HF1 cells, and its level was markedly reduced in late HF1 cells ( Figure 3A ). Our results suggest that the viral proteins trigger the initiation of transformation, but their effects are reduced in later stages. In agreement with the expression of E7, the Rb protein level was reduced in early HF1 cells, but elevated in late HF1 cells. Thus Rb expression did not correlate with sensitivity to stress. A. Representative western blots of whole cell lysates of primary keratinocytes, early and late HF1 cells under basal growth conditions. Blots show the status of HPV16 E7 protein, Rb and p53. Graphs show quantification of these blots. Protein densities were normalized to the densities of the bands in early HF1 cells. Error bars represent the standard deviations of three independent experiments. Tubulin serves as a loading control. B. Real-time PCR for NOXA expression under basal conditions. RNA was isolated from untreated cells and subjected to reverse-transcription followed by real-time PCR with specific primers for NOXA and HPRT as control. NOXA results were normalized to the HPRT results. Error bars represent the standard errors of three independent experiments. C. Real-time PCR for NOXA expression in starved vs. untreated cells. Cells were serum starved for 24 h, RNA was isolated, reverse-transcribed and subjected to real-time PCR as in B. Fold induction represents results of starved cells vs. non-starved cells. Error bars represent the standard error of three independent experiments. D. Reporter assay for p53 activity in untreated and serum starved cells. Cells were transfected with firefly-luciferase (FFL), either under the control of 17 p53-response elements, or under the control of mutant response elements as control. For transfection control cells were co-transfected with renilla-luciferase under the control of CMV promoter. 24 h after transfection cell medium was replaced with normal growth medium or starvation medium, for another 24 h. Cells were lysed and subjected to luminisence assay. Error bars represent standard errors of four independent experiments. The level of p53 was gradually reduced upon progression from primary keratinocytes, through early to late HF1 cells ( Figure 3A ). P53 appeared in the western blot as three bands; the lower band was intensified in late HF1 cells, but the other two almost disappeared. Sequencing of p53 cDNA in these cells revealed no mutation or deletion in the p53 coding sequence (data not shown), so the three bands appear to represent wt p53 with different post-translational modifications. The p53 protein is very highly regulated, mainly via phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation [18] . Reaction with several antibodies that recognize different phosphorylated forms of p53 did not shed light on the protein's activity in the various cell types (not shown). In order to compare p53 activity in the three cell types under normal growth conditions we looked at the expression of p53 targets. Table 1 shows expression levels of six known p53 targets, which were obtained from Affymetrix micro-arrays (Kravchenko-Balasha, in preparation). There was a gradual decrease in the expression of GADD45, p21, MMP2 and TGFalpha from the primary keratinocytes through early HF1 cells, to late HF1 cells. NOXA and IGFBP3 expression rose slightly in early HF1 cells, but was dramatically reduced in the later stage. GAPDH expression is given as an internal control for constant mRNA expression. NOXA is a known mediator of the anti-apoptotic effects of p53 [19] . We therefore validated the micro-array results by real-time PCR of this gene and normalized NOXA expression to the expression of the house-keeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Indeed, NOXA RNA levels rose slightly in early HF1 cells, but was markedly reduced in late HF1 cells ( Figure 3B ). Integration of the micro-array data and real-time PCR results show a marked reduction in its basal activity in late HF1 cells, but not in early HF1 cells. Table1: Expression of p53 targets according to Affymetrix Human Genome U133A microarrays. Results were normalized to the expression in the primary keratinocytes. GAPDH expression is given as internal control. Standard deviations are of three arrays for each cell type. Due to the possible involvement of p53 in the stress response, we examined the changes in p53 activity after serum starvation. We used NOXA as a marker for pro-apoptotic p53 activity. Surprisingly, real-time PCR of NOXA showed that although the basal NOXA RNA level was reduced, induction in response to starvation increased as transformation proceeded ( Figure 3C ). We confirmed these results with a reporter assay, where firefly-luciferase (FFL) was expressed under the control of p53-response elements, with mutant response elements serving as controls. Differences in transfection efficiency were eliminated by normalization to renilla-luciferase under the control of the CMV-promoter. FFL activity was measured under basal growth conditions and following 24 h starvation.",
          "Antitumor effects of two bisdioxopiperazines against two experimental lung cancer models  [Chunk 2]\n\nProbimane (Pro), an anti-cancer agent originating in China, was derived from razoxane (ICRF-159, Raz), a drug created in Britain, specifically targeting at cancer metastasis and as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines. Pro and Raz are bisdioxopiperazine compounds. In this work, we evaluated the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of Pro and Raz in vivo against two lung tumor models, one of murine origin (Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC) and one of human origin (LAX-83). After determining the lethal dosage of Pro and Raz, we assessed and compared the inhibitory effects of Pro and Raz against primary tumor growth and metastatic occurrences of LLC at the dosage of LD5. Pro and Raz were active against primary tumor growth and significantly inhibited pulmonary metastasis of LLC at same dose-ranges (inhibitory rates > 90 %). Both Raz and Pro were effective in 1, 5, and 9 day administration schedules. Three different schedules of Raz and Pro were effective against the primary tumor growth of LLC (35\u201350 %). The synergistic anticancer effect of Raz with bleomycin (Ble) (from 41.3 % to 73.3 %) was more obvious than those with daunorubicin (Dau) (from 33.1 % to 56.3 %) in the LLC tumor model. Pro was also seen to have synergistic anti-cancer effects with Ble in the LLC model. Both Raz and Pro inhibited the growth of LAX 83 in a statistically significant manner. These data suggest that both Raz and Pro may have anti-tumor potentiality and Raz and Pro have combinative effects with Ble or Dau. The potential targets of bisdioxopiperazines may include lung cancers, especially on tumor metastasis. The anti-cancer effects of Raz and Pro can be increased with the help of other anticancer drugs.\n\nhen observed from a light microscope.

          "Perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to weight maintenance among young women: A community survey [Chunk 2]\n\nYoung women are a group at high risk of weight gain. This study examined a range of perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance among young women, and how these varied by socioeconomic status (SES), overweight status and domestic situation. In October-December 2001, a total of 445 women aged 18\u201332 years, selected randomly from the Australian electoral roll, completed a mailed self-report survey that included questions on 11 barriers to physical activity and 11 barriers to healthy eating (relating to personal, social and environmental factors). Height, weight and socio-demographic details were also obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost. Women with children were particularly likely to report a lack of social support as an important barrier to physical activity, and lack of social support and time as important barriers to healthy eating. Perceived barriers did not differ by SES or overweight status. Health promotion strategies aimed at preventing weight gain should take into account the specific perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating faced by women in this age group, particularly lack of motivation, lack of time, and cost. Strategies targeting perceived lack of time and lack of social support are particularly required for young women with children.\n\nh item showed the largest loading. The Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficients for the three factors ranged from 0.68 to 0.76, indicating moderate internal reliability. Provisional names were assigned for these three factors: 'personal barriers', 'social support barriers' and 'environmental barriers'. The items included as personal barriers to physical activity were related to motivation, enjoyment, and skill. Social support barriers encompassed lack of support from family and friends; and environmental barriers related to information, access, cost, and time. The principal components analysis of the 11 barriers to healthy eating resulted in two distinct interpretable factors with eigenvalues greater than one (Table 2 ). The Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficients for the two factors were 0.72 and 0.83, indicating moderate to good internal reliability. Together the two factors explained 53% of the total variance. Provisional names were assigned to these factors: 'personal and environmental barriers' and 'social and environmental barriers'. Personal and environmental barriers to healthy eating included motivation, enjoyment, skills, information, cost, and access. Social and environmental barriers were related to lack of support from family and friends and time constraints. Mean factor scores did not vary according to women's overweight status or SES. Mean factor scores did differ significantly by domestic situation for two factors: social support barriers to physical activity and social and environmental barriers to healthy eating (see Table 3 ). Compared with women living in other domestic situations, women with children had the lowest score on the social support for physical activity factor, suggesting that lack of support from partners, children and friends was a more important perceived barrier to physical activity for these women. This group also had the lowest score on social and environmental barriers to healthy eating factor, suggesting that lack of social support and insufficient time were more important perceived barriers to healthy eating among women with children than among other women. Conversely, young women who lived with their parents had the highest scores on these factors, indicating the relative lack of importance of social support for physical activity, and social and environmental barriers to healthy eating, for this group. Mean standardized factor scores on weight maintenance by domestic situation a a . A large positive score represents more important barriers; a large negative score, less important barriers. This study suggests that a lack of motivation, time constraints due to work, and cost issues are the key perceived barriers to maintaining weight faced by young women. Overall these findings support other research that has examined barriers to physical activity and healthy eating [ 18 , 22 , 25 , 39 ]. However, the present study is unique in providing an insight into the relative importance of a range of personal, social and environmental factors as perceived barriers to weight maintenance among young women, a high risk group for weight gain. Findings showed that young women tended to rate personal factors as key perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating, followed by environmental factors, with social factors rated as less important. While the environment is likely to be an important source of influence on obesity-related behaviours [ 40 ], these findings highlight that efforts to prevent obesity should not ignore the central role of cognitive factors. Given the striking similarities in the types of barriers reported to impede physical activity, and the perceived barriers to healthy eating, findings also suggest that there may be potential economies of scale in health promotion programs aimed at preventing weight gain among young women. For example, strategies aimed at boosting motivation for healthy behaviour may help to promote both increased physical activity and healthy eating simultaneously. While motivating young healthy women to adopt healthy eating and physical activity behaviors is likely to be challenging, recent intervention research suggests that motivationally-tailored interventions may be more successful that other approaches (e.g. based on social-cognitive theory) in promoting physical activity and healthy eating [ 41 , 42 ]. It is noteworthy that perceived barriers to weight maintenance did not vary by socio-economic status or overweight status in this sample of women. In contrast, previous research has shown that overweight men and women face a number of perceived physical activity barriers [ 32 ]. Similarly, given that diet varies by socio-economic status [ 43 , 44 ] we expected that women of lower socio-economic status would be more likely to experience barriers to eating a healthy diet. Previous studies also suggest that persons of low SES often live in areas where the cost of food is greater, and access to healthy foods is poorer [ 30 , 31 ]. The reasons for the difference between the present results and earlier findings are unclear. It may be, however, that in this sample of relatively young women, many were still acquiring their education, and hence any SES differences in perceived barriers to healthy behaviours were not yet established. Compared to other young women, those living with children were the most likely to report lack of social support for physical activity, and lack of support and time for healthy eating, as key perceived barriers to maintaining their weight. Young women who lived with their parents were the least likely to perceive these to be barriers to weight maintenance. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies showing that getting married and having children are associated with decreased physical activity and greater weight gain [ 21 , 26 ]. Any weight gain prevention program targeting women with children should incorporate a focus on enlisting social support for both physical activity, and shopping for and preparing healthy foods. In a previous study with the same sample, we reported that while the majority of the women were in a healthy weight range (51%) or overweight/obese (31%), 18% of the women were underweight [ 21 ]. It should be acknowledged that some women in this sample, particularly those who were underweight, may have been trying to gain weight. One limitation of the present study was that the questions assessing perceived barriers to weight maintenance did not distinguish women trying to keep their weight down, from those trying to keep their weight up, and interpretation of the questions on perceived barriers may have been slightly different between these groups. However, attempts to gain weight are relatively uncommon among young women [ 45 ], and hence this is likely to have affected only a small proportion of the sample. A second limitation of this study is that the barriers were not assessed objectively, but rather through self-reports (ie perceived barriers). Nonetheless, it is important to consider women's perceptions of factors hindering their efforts to engage in healthy behaviours, since objective barriers may be perceived differently by different women (e.g., poor access to a gym may be viewed as less of a barrier to physical activity among a woman who walks for exercise than one who prefers aerobics). Finally, although the study achieved a somewhat modest response rate, the sample was selected from a nationally representative sampling frame and the socio-demographic profile of women was comparable to that of similarly-aged women in the wider population [ 35 ]. The findings of this study highlight the need for health promotion strategies that provide increased motivation, support and skills to enable young women to shop and prepare healthy, quick and inexpensive meals. Similarly, the findings suggest a need to promote more time-efficient physical activity alternatives.",

        "query": "How do vaccines work in the immune system?",
        "answer": "The provided context documents do not specifically address how vaccines work in the immune system. They primarily discuss cancer immunotherapy, the role of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in B cell lymphomas, and the effects of antigen stimulation on lymphomagenesis, particularly in relation to the MYC proto-oncogene and various immunosuppressants.\n\nTo provide a comprehensive answer to the question of how vaccines work in the immune system, I can summarize the general principles of vaccination:\n\n1. **Introduction of Antigen**: Vaccines typically contain antigens, which are components of pathogens (like proteins or pieces of the pathogen's genetic material) that stimulate an immune response without causing disease.\n\n2. **Activation of the Immune System**: Upon vaccination, the immune system recognizes these antigens as foreign. This triggers an immune response, activating various immune cells, including B cells and T cells.\n\n3. **B Cell Response**: B cells are activated and differentiate into plasma cells, which produce antibodies specific to the vaccine's antigens. These antibodies help neutralize pathogens if the body encounters them in the future.\n\n4. **T Cell Response**: T cells are also activated; CD4+ T helper cells assist in orchestrating the immune response, while CD8+ cytotoxic T cells can kill infected cells directly.\n\n5. **Immunological Memory**: Following the initial response, some of the activated B and T cells become memory cells. These cells persist in the body and enable a faster and more robust response if the individual is exposed to the actual pathogen later on.\n\n6. **Long-lasting Protection**: This immunological memory is what provides long-term protection against diseases, often for many years, and is the basis for the effectiveness of vaccines.\n\nIn summary, while the context documents do not provide specific information about vaccines, the principles of how vaccines work in the immune system involve the introduction of antigens to stimulate an immune response, leading to the activation of B and T cells, the production of antibodies, and the establishment of immunological memory for future protection against pathogens.",

          "The B Cell Antigen Receptor and Overexpression of  [Chunk 7]\n\nA variety of circumstantial evidence from humans has implicated the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in the genesis of B cell lymphomas. We generated mouse models designed to test this possibility directly, and we found that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated state of a clonal BCR affected the rate and outcome of lymphomagenesis initiated by the proto-oncogene MYC. The tumors that arose in the presence of constitutive BCR differed from those initiated by MYC alone and resembled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (B-CLL), whereas those that arose in response to antigen stimulation resembled large B-cell lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma (BL). We linked the genesis of the BL-like tumors to antigen stimulus in three ways. First, in reconstruction experiments, stimulation of B cells by an autoantigen in the presence of overexpressed MYC gave rise to BL-like tumors that were, in turn, dependent on both MYC and the antigen for survival and proliferation. Second, genetic disruption of the pathway that mediates signaling from the BCR promptly killed cells of the BL-like tumors as well as the tumors resembling B-CLL. And third, growth of the murine BL could be inhibited by any of three distinctive immunosuppressants, in accord with the dependence of the tumors on antigen-induced signaling. Together, our results provide direct evidence that antigenic stimulation can participate in lymphomagenesis, point to a potential role for the constitutive BCR as well, and sustain the view that the constitutive BCR gives rise to signals different from those elicited by antigen. The mouse models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas, and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics.\n\nat are ubiquitous in the B cell lineage of the transgenic animals: overexpression of MYC and stimulus by an autoantigen. Thus, a vast population of cells may be predisposed to tumor progression. Indeed, it is remarkable that the resulting tumors are composed of only a finite number of clones, suggesting the occurrence of clonal selection for tumorigenic events beyond those imposed experimentally. The results contrast sharply with the innumerable clones that proliferate to produce a relatively indolent disease in MRL mice, a proliferation that is itself driven by autoimmunity . A variety of circumstantial evidence has implicated antigenic stimulus in the genesis of BL [ 83 ]. First, chronic infection with malaria in Africa is associated with an increased incidence of BL and accelerated progression of the disease [ 84 , 85 ]. Second, the possibility of sustained antigenic stimulus is raised by the mature, activated immunophenotype characteristic of BL cells [ 86 ]. Third, the sequences for the immunoglobulin molecules in many NHL, including BL, bear somatic mutations of the sort that normally arise during the process of affinity maturation [ 8 \u2013 14 ] If antigenic stimulation does play a role in the genesis of human BL, it would be in cooperation with MYC , whose activation by chromosomal translocation is a general feature of the tumor [ 87 ]. Our results with mouse models suggest that the hypothetical role of antigenic stimulus in the pathogenesis of BL should be pursued further. We have shown that antigenic stimulus can apparently contribute to the establishment and maintenance of B-cell lymphomas in mice. The tumors that arose in the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL and MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice expressed a neo-autoantigen (sHEL), which provided an autoimmune stimulus to the tumor cells. This in turn allowed the tumors to become self-sufficient and retain continuous cognate antigen stimulation upon transplantation. This notion was further supported by experiments in which the signaling components of the BCR were genetically disrupted with shRNAs. The requirement for antigen in turn suggested that the tumors might respond to pharmacological interruption of signaling from the BCR. This proved to be the case: treatment with cyclosporin, FK506, or rapamycin elicited prolonged remissions. These results conform to the view that antigen-induced signaling from the BCR was involved in the genesis of the tumors. We recognize, however, that none of the immunosuppressants acts exclusively on signaling from the BCR and, as a result, each might inhibit tumors by a different means [ 88 \u2013 90 ]. For example, it has been reported that rapamycin can inhibit angiogenesis in certain solid tumors [ 91 ], whereas other immunosuppressants failed to demonstrate this inhibition. In contrast, rapamycin, cyclosporin, and FK506 all inhibit signaling from the BCR [ 92 \u2013 94 ], and all three elicited remissions of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL and MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. Moreover, this uniform effect of the three immunosuppressants did not extend to tumors in which antigen stimulus ostensibly played no role (E\u03bc- MYC and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL ). We conclude that the therapeutic effects of immunosuppressants reported here for the BL model probably reflect the role of antigen-induced signaling from the BCR in the pathogenesis of the tumor. Tactics that interrupt expression of signaling from the BCR might also be useful in the treatment of human lymphomas that express the receptor. Mice carrying the E\u03bc- MYC transgene have been described previously [ 20 ] and were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. These mice express MYC in a B cell\u2013specific manner, beginning at the Pre/Pro-B cell stage. The TRE- MYC and MMTV-rtTA mice have been described previously [ 21 , 23 ]. We crossbred these strains to combine the two transgenes in a single strain (MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC), in which the B cell\u2013specific expression of the MYC transgene can be repressed by the administration of tetracycline or doxycycline. We also used both BCR HEL mice, which express a pre-rearranged murine BCR from the endogenous immunoglobulin promoter, and sHEL mice, which ubiquitously express a transgene for the soluble form of soluble HEL under the control of the metallothionein promoter. These two strains have been described previously [ 25 ] and were generously provided by Jason Cyster (University of California, San Francisco). We also used a strain of mice in which a previously rearranged IgH VDJ sequence was knocked into the IgH locu [ 95 ]. When used in combination with another strain, encoding an IgL transgene (Lt-tg), those bigenic mice generate about 30% HEL-specific B cells, as previously describe[ 95 ]5]. Those two strains of mice were kindly provided by Jason Cyster, at UCSF. All transgenic mouse lines were maintained on a C57/BL6 background, and were genotyped by PCR as previously described [ 20 , 25 , 96 ]. All animals were maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the Committee on Animal Research at the University of California, San Francisco, and the National Research Council. Adoptive transfers of cells and transplantation of tumors were done by injecting 10 6 cells intravenously (unless otherwise indicated) into syngeneic (C57/BL6) females ranging in age from 4\u20136 wk. For the experiments that involved tumor cells obtained from MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, the recipient mice were sublethally irradiated (450 rads) in order to overcome some remaining allogeneic differences between the two strains. The emergence of tumors was followed in three ways: (i) physical examination of living animals and necropsy of deceased animals, particularly to detect enlargement of lymphoid organs and viscera; (ii) counting the total number of cells in organs; and (iii) the specific enumeration of B cells carrying cell-surface receptor for the antigen HEL. Three pairs of lymph nodes were collected each time (two inguinal, two axillary, and two brachial lymph nodes). These lymph nodes were pooled and processed into single-cell suspensions. Spleens and thymii were also collected and used to generate single-cell suspensions. Each spleen or thymus was individually ground on a 60-\u03bcm wire mesh screen (Sigma). The red blood cells were lysed in TAC buffer (0.017 M Tris, pH 7.65, and 0.135 M NH 4 Cl), as previously described [ 95 ], and the resulting pellets were resuspended in complete lymphocyte media, which consists of RPMI1640 + 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, supplemented with L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, nonessential amino acids, 2 mM HEPES, 2mM sodium pyruvate, and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoeathanol (all obtained from Invitrogen). Single-cell suspensions were counted with a Coulter counter (Coulter Diagnostics). The percentage of viable cells was determined by uptake of 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD) and flow cytometry. The values for total cell numbers were used to derive the number of viable cells by multiplying percentage of viable cells (obtained from the 7AAD analysis) by the total number of cells (obtained from the Coulter counter analysis), and dividing by 100. These measurements were compared with microscopic counting of trypan-blue excluding cells in a hemocytometer. To determine the number of B cells carrying the BCR HEL transgene, single-cell suspensions were stained with antibodies to B220 and IgM a (both obtained from Pharmingen Laboratories), followed by flow cytometric analysis. The number of BCR HEL + B cells was determined by multiplying the percentage of B220+/IgM a + cells (obtained from the FACS analysis) by the number of total viable cells and dividing by 100. These values were compared to stains performed using a pan-specific antibody to IgM (Pharmingen Laboratories). This approach was used to determine the number of BCR HEL expressing cells in all the cases where the mice were on a C57/BL6 background, where the allotype expressed is normally IgM b .",
          "The B Cell Antigen Receptor and Overexpression of  [Chunk 3]\n\nA variety of circumstantial evidence from humans has implicated the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in the genesis of B cell lymphomas. We generated mouse models designed to test this possibility directly, and we found that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated state of a clonal BCR affected the rate and outcome of lymphomagenesis initiated by the proto-oncogene MYC. The tumors that arose in the presence of constitutive BCR differed from those initiated by MYC alone and resembled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (B-CLL), whereas those that arose in response to antigen stimulation resembled large B-cell lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma (BL). We linked the genesis of the BL-like tumors to antigen stimulus in three ways. First, in reconstruction experiments, stimulation of B cells by an autoantigen in the presence of overexpressed MYC gave rise to BL-like tumors that were, in turn, dependent on both MYC and the antigen for survival and proliferation. Second, genetic disruption of the pathway that mediates signaling from the BCR promptly killed cells of the BL-like tumors as well as the tumors resembling B-CLL. And third, growth of the murine BL could be inhibited by any of three distinctive immunosuppressants, in accord with the dependence of the tumors on antigen-induced signaling. Together, our results provide direct evidence that antigenic stimulation can participate in lymphomagenesis, point to a potential role for the constitutive BCR as well, and sustain the view that the constitutive BCR gives rise to signals different from those elicited by antigen. The mouse models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas, and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics.\n\nCR HEL cells into sHEL mice and introduced these into either wild-type or a second set of sHEL mice that were not treated with doxycycline. Donor cells again amplified rapidly in the sHEL mice, but not in wild-type recipients ( Figure 4 C). Tumors resulted in death of the recipient mice within 12\u201316 d, a latency appreciably shorter than that observed after the preceding transplantation (28\u201330 d). The flow cytometric profile of the donor cells changed after their encounter with antigen. The donor cells expressed B220, BCR HEL , CD19, CD21, and CD23, but did not express CD69 or B7\u20132 on their surface. The cells that resulted from the expansion following antigenic stimulation in vivo showed a loss of CD23 expression and high levels of CD69 and B7\u20132 expression (unpublished data). The same phenotype was observed with the cells that had expanded following the second transplantation into sHEL recipient mice. This phenotype is typical of antigen-activated B cells. In addition, it is similar to what we initially observed in the cells from tumors that arose in the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice and, thus, also resembles the phenotype of BL ( Table 1 ). We conclude that the appearance and expansion of HEL-specific, BL-like tumor cells in the recipient mice were dependent on stimulation by the cognate antigen. In contrast to the preceding findings, tumor cells obtained from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice or MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice would grow into lethal tumors when transplanted into recipient mice in the absence of HEL antigen ( Figure 4 A, 4 C, and 4F). We postulated that this seeming independence of antigen was due to the intrinsic production of antigen by the tumor cells themselves, as would be expected from the genotype of the cells. That proved to be the case. We were able to detect HEL transcripts and HEL protein in cells obtained from either a primary E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor or an MMTV-TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor, but not in cells obtained from either E\u03bc- MYC or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors (unpublished data). Similarly, we found HEL protein in tumors that arose following transplantation of cells from a primary E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor. We conclude that the murine BL cells are in fact antigen-dependent, but can be sustained by either autocrine or paracrine stimulus. To further test the role of antigen stimulation in the genesis of the B-CLL\u2013 and BL-like tumors, we disrupted the molecular machinery that generates and transmits signals from the BCR. By transduction of suitable interfering RNAs into established tumor cells, we were able to suppress the expression of the Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 signaling chains of the BCR. We have previously shown that these shRNA sequences targeting Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 lead to substantial reduction in the levels of Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 protein in K46\u03bc B cells, respectively [ 33 ]. We have observed that shRNAs directed at either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 individually caused a decrease in the levels of surface IgM in transduced B cells. Importantly, the expression of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 on the cell surface modulates the surface expression of IgH and IgL, the antigen-specific components of the BCR. The vector used for transduction was a lentivirus that has been previously described [ 34 ]. The viruses tested in vitro and in vivo were the parental vector encoding either GFP (pLL3.7) or Thy1.1 (pLL3.77) as a reporter gene, and variants encoding both a reporter gene and shRNAs for either Ig\u03b1, Ig\u03b2, or firefly luciferase, the last as a negative control. Transduction was performed with tumor cells isolated from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice. The rates of transduction varied between 5%\u201350% of the tumor cells ( Figure 5 A). The cells were then maintained in culture and evaluated on a daily basis for reporter gene expression. (A) Cell lines were generated from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors and designated as DBL114, or from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors and designated TBL-1. These cell lines uniformly express B220 and IgM on their surface. To determine whether the shRNA sequences targeting Ig\u03b1 were able to knock down their target protein, we measured the levels of IgM expressed on the surface of DBL-114 cells that were transduced with lentiviral constructs that encode a reporter gene ( GFP ). The expression of IgM on the surface is co-modulated with Ig\u03b1 expression, hence the loss of Ig\u03b1 should reduce the levels of surface IgM. The panels represent the flow cytometric profile of the DBL-114 cells that had been transduced with the parental virus (pLL3.7), or a variant that encodes an shRNA specific for firefly luciferase, as a negative control, or two variants of pLL3.7 that encode different shRNAs specific for Ig\u03b1. The GFP-positive cells in the panels that contained shRNAs specific for Ig\u03b1 showed a loss of surface IgM expression. This is not the case for the GFP-negative fraction of the same cell populations. Similar results were obtained in TBL-1 cells (unpublished data). (B) The shRNA-mediated knock-down of Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 in cells obtained from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors confers a competitive disadvantage on those cells in vitro, compared to their nontransduced counterparts. Single-cell suspensions were generated from the respective tumors, and used for lentiviral transductions. The cells were maintained in cultured and assayed for GFP expression, by flow cytometry every 24 h. The data for the GFP+ fraction in the population of cells harboring a lentivirus encoding and shRNA was divided by the fraction of GFP+ cells in the population of cells that was transduced with the parental vector, in order to standardize the values and examine the rates of change from the starting level of GFP+ cells, as previously reported [ 104 ]. The cells that were transduced with lentiviruses encoding shRNAs specific for either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 exhibited a significant competitive disadvantage when compared to the cells harboring lentiviruses encoding shRNAs specific for firefly luciferase. All wells were set up in triplicates. The graphs represent data from one experiment, representative of eight independent experiments. (C) In vivo validation of the effects of Ig\u03b1-specific shRNAs on the maintenance of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors. Cells were obtained from E\u03bc-MYC/BCR HEL tumors, and transduced in vitro with pLL3.77-sh.luciferase (uses thy1.1 as a reporter gene) or pLL3.7-sh.Ig\u03b1.1 (uses GFP as a reporter gene). The different cell populations were then mixed in order to generate mixtures of cells that contained an approximately equal fraction of cells that harbored the control lentivirus (pLL3.77.sh.luciferase) and the experimental lentivirus (pLL3.7.sh.Ig\u03b1). The mixtures of cells were transplanted into cohorts of Rag-1 \u2013/\u2013 mice. The mice were observed daily until they exhibited externally evident signs of lymphoma, and the organs were harvested. The graphs represent the fraction of cells in the tumorous lymph nodes that retained expression of either thy1.1 (for the control lentivirus), or GFP (for the Ig\u03b1-specific lentivirus. These results confirm the requirement for Ig\u03b1 expression in the maintenance of the murine BCLs. We observed that for both E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, the percentage of cells transduced with either the parental lentivirus, or the variant that encoded shRNA specific to firefly luciferase, did not change appreciably during a 14 day period ( Figure 5 B). In contrast, each of the cultures that was transduced with a lentiviral variant that encoded shRNAs specific to either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 displayed a significant decrease in the frequency of the cells expressing the reporter gene ( Figure 5 B). The same pattern was observed with two independent shRNAs for each of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2. This in vitro competition assay suggested that loss of signaling from the BCR placed the tumor cells at a significant disadvantage when compared to their counterparts that had retained normal signaling from the BCR.",

This in vitro competition assay suggested that loss of signaling from the BCR placed the tumor cells at a significant disadvantage when compared to their counterparts that had retained normal signaling from the BCR. In addition, these results demonstrate that the signaling components of the BCR are required for tumors that depend on autogenous signaling by the BCR-derived signals as well as for those that rely on the cognate-antigen\u2013induced BCR signals. To verify these observations in vivo, we isolated tumor cells from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice, and transduced them as described above. We then transplanted the transduced tumor cells into Rag-1 \u2013/\u2013 mice, to evaluate tumor fitness in the absence of any T cell responses to the reporter genes. In this instance, we mixed tumor cells that had been transduced with pLL3.77 (providing thy1.1 as a reporter) encoding an shRNA to firefly luciferase with tumor cells transduced with pLL3.7 (providing GFP as a reporter) encoding shRNAs specific to either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2. This would provide internal controls for each of the mice we transplanted in the cohort. We euthanized the mice 21 days after transplantation, when they developed external signs associated with lymphoma (scruffy fur, hunched posture, lymphadenopathy, dehydration, labored breathing, and an ascending hind limb paralysis). The lymph nodes and spleens were collected and used to generate single-cell suspensions. The cells were then stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. Tumor cells transduced with either pLL3.7-sh.Ig\u03b1 or pLL3.7-shIg\u03b2 failed to expand in vivo ( Figure 5 C), mirroring the results obtained in vitro. In contrast, the nontransduced cells, or the cells transduced with pLL3.77-sh.Luc, expanded in vivo and gave rise to the resulting malignancies. In addition, the genetic disruption of Syk, a key membrane-proximal element of the BCR signal, also conferred a significant competitive disadvantage to established BCL cells in a manner analogous to what we present here with Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 (RMY and YR, unpublished results). These results show that for both tumor types, the acute loss of the signaling components of the BCR complex resulted in a severe competitive disadvantage in vivo, suggesting that these two types of tumors are dependent upon continuous signaling from the BCR. The apparent contribution of BCR signaling to the development of murine lymphomas prompted us to explore the effect of immunosuppressants on the various mouse models. We used cyclosporin A, FK506, and rapamycin to treat well advanced tumors that had been initiated by transplantation. We compared the effects of these agents to that of cyclophosphamide, an agent commonly used to treat human BL [ 35 ]. We transplanted 10 6 cells obtained from tumor-bearing spleen or lymph nodes into cohorts of 4\u201310 mice. The recipient mice were held for observation until they developed externally obvious lymphadenopathy (approximately 100 d for the E\u03bc- MYC tumors, 58 d for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors, 21 d for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, and 14 d for the MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors). The tumor bearing and control wild-type mice were then treated daily for 7 d with intravenous injections of the various drugs. Mice were either euthanized 24 h after the last injection of drug, or held indefinitely to ascertain duration of survival. The analysis of tumor burden was performed with cells obtained from lymph nodes and spleens. The E\u03bc- MYC tumors did not respond to any of the immunosuppressive drugs we tested ( Figure 6 A and 6 E). Disease progressed at the same rate in treated and untreated mice. Histological examination of the affected organs also revealed no evidence of therapeutic response (unpublished data). In contrast, the transplanted E\u03bc- MYC tumors showed a strong response to cyclophosphamide, as previously described [ 36 ]. Treatment with cyclophosphamide elicited tumor regression in all animals, but also caused a more general cytotoxicity, manifested as a reduction in T cells, myeloid cells, and nontransgenic B cells (unpublished data). Similar toxicity from cyclophosphamide was also observed in wild-type mice. Tumor cells were harvested from lymph nodes and spleens and transplanted as described in Methods. The recipient mice were held until tumors became clinically apparent. Tumor recipient (open bars) and wild type (filled bars) mice then received daily injections of the indicated drugs for 7 d of either cyclosporine A (csa), FK506, rapamycin (rap), or cyclophosphamide (cyph). For (A\u2013H), the mice were euthanized 24 h after the last injection of drug, and lymph nodes were harvested for analysis of either total number of cells (A\u2013D) (expressed in single units representing 10 6 cells each) or surface markers of donor cells (E\u2013H). For (I), the mice were observed over a span of 100 da and deaths recorded, as shown. (A and E) E\u03bc- MYC tumors. (B and F) E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors. (C and G) E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. (D and H) MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. (I) Survival of animals bearing E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. The statistical significance of the differences observed in the kinetics of mortality between the tumor-bearing mice that were either untreated, or treated transiently with cyclophosphamide is 0.01. The statistical significance of the difference in the mortality curves observed between those two groups and the tumor-bearing mice treated with either of the three immunosuppressant drugs is p < 0.001. The tumors derived from the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice responded to cyclophosphamide and cyclosporin, but not to either FK506 or rapamycin ( Figure 6 B and 6 F). In contrast, the tumors from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice, as well as tumors from the jaws of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice, responded to both cyclophosphamide and all three of the immunosuppressants tested ( Figure 6 C, 6 D, 6 G, 6 H). The different sensitivities of the tumors derived from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice and those derived from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL or MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice suggests that the constitutive and cognate-antigen\u2013derived BCR signals may be qualitatively distinct. Remissions of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors persisted for at least 5 mo, following a 7-d course of treatment with immunosuppressants ( Figure 6 I and unpublished data). In contrast, the animals treated with cyclophosphamide entered a brief remission, but still died more rapidly than did untreated, tumor-bearing mice ( Figure 6 I and unpublished data), apparently consequent to the toxicity described above. In summary, the response of the various model tumors varied consistently with the genotypes of the mice. B cell tumors that arose from the combined effects of MYC and antigen stimulus responded uniformly to three distinctive immunosuppressants, whereas only one of the three agents was effective against tumors elicited by MYC and a constitutive BCR (For data demonstrating the post-GC nature of antigen-stimulated tumors, see Figure S4 ). Since the E\u03bc- MYC tumors do not express BCR on their surface, they were presumably devoid of any apparent stimulus from the receptor, and were resistant to all the immunosuppressants tested. These results are in accord with two of our hypotheses: that tumorigenesis can be influenced by signals from the BCR, and that the signals generated by constitutive receptor may differ from those arising from an antigen-stimulated receptor (see Discussion ). We also explored whether the murine BL-like tumors were dependent on the continuous overexpression of MYC . To test this issue on established tumors, we allowed MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice to develop tumors in the absence of doxycycline.",

These values were compared to stains performed using a pan-specific antibody to IgM (Pharmingen Laboratories). This approach was used to determine the number of BCR HEL expressing cells in all the cases where the mice were on a C57/BL6 background, where the allotype expressed is normally IgM b . For the mice in which the genetic background was mixed (all the experiments that involved the MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC transgenes), the number of BCR HEL -expressing cells was determined by HEL binding. Single-cell suspensions were incubated with HEL (1 mg/ml, obtained from Sigma) in FACS buffer. These cells were washed and incubated with Hy9-biotin, an HEL-specific monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Jason Cyster, UCSF), followed by streptavidin-PE and B220-FITC (both obtained from Pharmingen Laboratories). The surface phenotype of cells present in the lymphoid organs of normal and tumor-bearing mice was analyzed by flow cytometry. Single cell suspensions were prepared from the lymph nodes, spleens, thymus, and bone marrow. The cell suspensions were incubated with 1:50 dilutions of antibodies on ice for 30 min, and were then washed in FACS buffer (1% BSA in PBS + 0.05% sodium azide) and fixed in PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde. Cells were stained with antibodies to one or more of the following markers: B220, Thy1.2, Mac-1, IgM (pan), IgM a , IgM b , IgD (pan) and IgD a , CD4, CD5, CD8, CD19, CD21, CD23, CD25, CD44, CD62L, CD69, CD80, and/or CD86 (all obtained from BD-Pharmingen). Binding of HEL to B cells was assessed by incubating cell suspensions with 1 mg/ml HEL (Sigma) in FACS buffer. The cells were then washed and incubated with Hy9-biotin, followed by Streptavidin-PE (BD-Pharmingen). To determine the clonal composition of the tumors, we adapted a protocol that has been described previously [ 97 ]. Genomic DNA was extracted from 10 6 cells (from either spleen or lymph nodes) using the Quiagen genomic DNA mini-kit (Quiagen), following the manufacturer's specifications. 200 ng of genomic DNA was used for a nested PCR reaction. The first reaction consisted of 5 \u03bcl of 10X Taq buffer (Gibco/Invitrogen), 4 \u03bcl of 50 mM MgCl 2 , 2.5 ng of V H -specific primer, 2.5 ng of J H- specific primer, 2.5 nM dNTPs (Roche Diagnostics) and 2.5 U of Taq polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) and distilled-deionized water to a final volume of 50 \u03bcl. The reactions were placed in a thermal cycler (MJ-Research) and subjected to a PCR cycle as previously described [ 97 ]. A sample of 2 \u03bcl from the first reaction was used as a template for the second reaction of the nested PCR. This reaction was conducted as the first one, except that the primer pairs encoded sequences within the initial set used earlier. The sequences for all the primers used have been previously described [ 96 ]. The PCR reaction products were fractionated in a 2% agarose/TAE gel, stained with ethidium bromide. Some of the PCR products were cloned using a TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen Laboratories), following manufacturer's specifications, then sequenced using the Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems), following manufacturer's specification, at the UCSF General Clinical Research Centers core facility. We used the Reynolds algorithm [ 98 ] and pSICO oligomaker software [ 35 ] in order to design the optimal target shRNA sequences. Those core 19-mer sequences were incorporated into the oligonucleotides designed to contain the stem and loop portions of the shRNA to be cloned into the vector pLL3.7 [ 36 ]. Cloning was performed as previously described [ 36 ]. The specific sequences we used to disrupt expression of murine Ig\u03b1, Ig\u03b2 or the control (firefly luciferase) have been described elsewhere [ 95 ]. All constructs presented here were initially validated for their ability to specifically knock down the expression levels of the protein of interest by transduction of two BCLs that we generated from the mouse models presented here. The two types of B cell lines we generated were derived from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL (DBL: d ouble transgenic B cell lymphoma) and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL (TBL: t riply transgenic B cell lymphoma) primary murine tumors. DBL and TBL cell lines were generated by passive selection from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL primary murine tumors, respectively. Tumor B cell lines were grown in C10 (RPMI, 10% FBS (HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen) 100 units/ml penicillin G and streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 0.55 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen)). The GFP+ fraction of the transduced cell population was used for either Western blotting or flow cytometric analysis of protein expression. To generate infectious viral particles, we used 293FT cells as a packaging system that had been previously described [ 99 ]. 293FT cells were grown in D10 media (DMEM, 10% FBS (HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). 293FT cells grown to 60% confluency in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 5 \u03bcg pLL3.7, 3.3 \u03bcg pMDLg/pRRE, 1.3\u03bcg pRSV-REV, and 1.9\u03bcg pMD.G [ 99 ] overnight using calcium-phosphate methods, as described previously [ 36 ]. Media were replaced with 4.5 ml fresh D10 the following morning. Infections were performed as previously described [ 35 ]. Briefly, supernatants from 293FT cells were harvested 2 d after transfection and replaced with fresh D10. Viral supernatants were passed through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter and brought to a final concentration of 8 \u03bcg/ml polybrene and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. These supernatants were overlayed on 2 \u00d7 10 5 DBL and TBL cells and spun at 2,000 rpm for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C. Following spinfection, viral supernatants were removed and replaced with fresh C10. Infections were repeated the following day (3 d after transfection). For the in vitro assays used to determine whether the disruption of a gene product affected the competitiveness of a tumor cell, we used a mixed of transduced and nontransduced cells. The efficiency of viral transduction of DBL and TBL cell lines was initially evaluated 48 h after the second spin infection. We subsequently tracked infected cells for two weeks post-infection. For analysis, we normalized all infection efficiencies to the 48-h time point, and further normalized each day to the infection rate for the pLL3.7 alone. Groups of six mice were used for each of the experimental protocols. Four mice bearing transplanted tumors, and two age- and sex-matched wild-type mice were treated with the same drug and equal frequency. The transplant-recipient mice were held until tumors became clinically apparent (approximately 100 d for the E\u03bc- MYC tumors, 58 d for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors, 21 d for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, and 14 d for the MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors). The mice then received daily injections of the indicated agents for 7 d. Mice were either euthanized 24 h after the last injection of drug, or held indefinitely to ascertain survival. Lymph nodes, spleens and bone marrows were collected and processed to generate single-cell suspensions. The cells were counted as described above. An aliquot from the cell suspensions was stained with antibodies for B220, Thy 1.2, Mac-1, IgM a , B7\u20132, and CD69, in order to determine the proportion of B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells, as well as the activation status of the HEL-reactive B cells. Treatments were performed with cyclosporin A (Bedford Laboratories) (2 mg/kg/day), FK506 (Prograf, Fujisawa Healthcare) (2 mg/kg/day), rapamycin (Biomol) (2 mg/kg/day), and cyclophosphamide (Bristol-Myers Squibb) (1 mg/kg/day). The therapeutic agents were suspended in PBS, sterilized by filtration through a 0.22\u03bcm membrane, and administered intravenously through the tail vein."

Document 1 briefly describes COVID-19 as an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and lists common symptoms, but it does not include transmission details. The other documents (2 to 5) focus on administrative and technical issues related to COVID-19, but do not address the modes of transmission of the virus.\n\nTo answer the question comprehensively, the following information is typically relevant regarding COVID-19 transmission:\n\n1. **Droplet Transmission**: COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. These droplets can be inhaled by people nearby.\n\n2. **Airborne Transmission**: In some circumstances, the virus can linger in the air and be inhaled, especially in enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces.\n\n3. **Surface Transmission**: Although less common, it is possible to contract the virus by touching surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus and then touching the face (mouth, nose, or eyes).\n\n4. **Close Contact**: Transmission can also occur through close personal contact with an infected individual, such as hugging or shaking hands.\n\nThis information about COVID-19 transmission is not included in the provided context documents, which means there is a lack of comprehensive details in the documents to address the question fully.",

In addition, clinicians are receiving calls from GPs seeking clinical advice about patients in an effort to avoid unnecessary presentations/admissions. \n\nUntil now these conversations have been documented in the paper medical record or in other informal ways. However, an increase in demand due to COVID-19 means this needs to be documented more formally in the EHR. The patients being discussed are likely to be known to Trak but there will be exceptions. Clinicians are happy to document discussions via Clinical Notes, which would be available should the patient be transferred/admitted. An episode is required in order to create Clinical Notes.\n\nFollowing discussions with Jody regarding these requirements, we utilised one of the options she suggested \u2013 OP Registration \u2013 which hadn&#39;t previously been utilised at SWARH, and modified this to suit our needs. This created a new NA episode to which Clinical Notes can be attached.\n\nPlease see attached document for full steps on what has been done at SWARH.

This implies that anthracycline chemotherapy can lead to heart-related issues.\n\n2. **Cytotoxicity**: It is mentioned that Probimane can reduce the cytotoxicity of anthracyclines, which indicates that chemotherapy agents can have harmful effects on normal cells in addition to targeting cancer cells.\n\n3. **Multi-drug Resistance (MDR)**: There is a discussion about MDR in lung cancer treatment, suggesting that some patients may experience reduced efficacy of chemotherapy drugs due to resistance mechanisms, which can be a significant issue in cancer treatment.\n\n4. **Histological Findings**: The documents mention \"obvious necrosis in tumor tissues\" following treatment with certain drugs, which indicates that while the treatment targets tumor cells, it can also lead to tissue damage.\n\nHowever, the context lacks detailed information on common side effects experienced by patients undergoing chemotherapy, such as nausea, vomiting, hair loss, fatigue, immune system suppression, anemia, and others typically associated with various chemotherapy regimens.\n\nIn summary, while the documents provide some insights into the cardioprotective and cytotoxic aspects of the specific drugs discussed, they do not offer comprehensive information about the general side effects of chemotherapy.

          "Antitumor effects of two bisdioxopiperazines against two experimental lung cancer models \n\nProbimane (Pro), an anti-cancer agent originating in China, was derived from razoxane (ICRF-159, Raz), a drug created in Britain, specifically targeting at cancer metastasis and as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines.

Pro and Raz were active against primary tumor growth and significantly inhibited pulmonary metastasis of LLC at same dose-ranges (inhibitory rates > 90 %). Both Raz and Pro were effective in 1, 5, and 9 day administration schedules. Three different schedules of Raz and Pro were effective against the primary tumor growth of LLC (35\u201350 %). The synergistic anticancer effect of Raz with bleomycin (Ble) (from 41.3 % to 73.3 %) was more obvious than those with daunorubicin (Dau) (from 33.1 % to 56.3 %) in the LLC tumor model. Pro was also seen to have synergistic anti-cancer effects with Ble in the LLC model. Both Raz and Pro inhibited the growth of LAX 83 in a statistically significant manner. These data suggest that both Raz and Pro may have anti-tumor potentiality and Raz and Pro have combinative effects with Ble or Dau.

The potential targets of bisdioxopiperazines may include lung cancers, especially on tumor metastasis. The anti-cancer effects of Raz and Pro can be increased with the help of other anticancer drugs.\n\nRazoxane (ICRF-159) ( Raz ), first developed in UK, was the earliest agent against spontaneous metastasis for the murine model (Lewis lung carcinoma) in 1969 [ 1 ]. A large volume of papers and projects have been published in the utilities and mechanisms of Raz for anticancer actions, like assisting radiotherapy, [ 2 ] overcoming multi-drug resistance (MDR) of daunorubicin and doxorubicin [ 3 ], inhibiting topoisomerase II [ 4 ] and so on. More importantly, Raz , as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines, has been licensed in 28 countries in 4 continents. Since morpholine groups in some structures were reported to be responsible for cytotoxic or modulative actions on tumors, an anticancer agent, probimane [1,2-bis (N 4 -morpholine-3, 5-dioxopeprazine-1-yl) propane; AT-2153, Pro] was synthesized by introducing two morpholine groups into Raz in China.[ 5 ]. Raz and Pro belong to bisdiopiperazines . Like Raz , Pro also exhibits anti-tumor activity both in vivo and in vitro against experimental tumor models in a small scale investigation [ 6 , 7 ] and limited clinical data showed that Pro could inhibit human malignant lymphoma even for those resistant to other anticancer drugs [ 8 ]. Pro exhibits the same pharmacological effects as Raz , like detoxication of Adriamycin ( ADR ) induced cardiotoxicities, and synergism with ADR against tumors [ 9 , 10 ]. We have found some novel biological effects of Pro , like inhibiting the activity of calmodulin ( CaM ), a cell-signal regulator, which can explain anticancer actions and the combined cytotoxic effect of Pro and ADR [ 11 ]. Pro was also shown to inhibit lipoperoxidation ( LPO ) of erythrocytes [ 12 ], influence tumor sialic acid synthesis [ 13 ] and inhibit the binding of fibrinogen to leukemia cells [ 14 ]. Lung cancer is the No 1 killer among all categories of cancers in urban areas in China and many Western countries. The high mortality rate of lung cancer can easily be caused by inducing multi-drug resistance ( MDR ) and by high metastatic occurrence in clinics [ 15 ]. Since we assume that Pro , like Raz may possess useful therapeutic potentialities, we evaluated in vivo the chemotherapeutical parameters of Pro and Raz for lung cancer of both murine and human origins. The lethal dosage of Pro and Raz is tabulated in Table 1 . Since the toxicity of Pro and Raz seemed to lack sex specificity in mice, we were able to combine their numbers for LD 50 and LD 5 calculations. We used the approximate dosage of LD 5 of Pro (60 mg/kg ip \u00d7 7) and Raz (20 mg/kg ip \u00d7 7) as equitoxic dosages for further treatment studies. The subacute toxicity of Pro and Raz in mice: Mouse survival was observed for 1 month. The numbers of mice in each group were 20 for each of the 5 dosages of a single agent. Antitumor and antimetastatic effects of Pro and Raz on LLC are tabulated in Table 2 and Table 3 . Pro and Raz at equitoxic dosages (LD 5 ) showed a noticeable anticancer effect on primary tumor growth (inhibitory rates, approximately 30\u201345 %), and significantly inhibited the formation of tumor metastases (inhibitory rates on pulmonary metastasis > 90 %, P < 0.001). Primary tumor growth of LLC was inhibited more by Pro (48 %) than by Raz (40.3%) in a 20 day trial, whereas the inhibition of Pro (35.7%) was slightly less than that of Raz (40 %) on an 11 day trial. Pro seems to be more persistent than Raz in inhibiting primary tumor growth of LLC . Antitumor effects of Raz and Pro on LLC are included in Table 4 , 5 , 6 . We evaluated 1, 5 and 9 day administration schedules in our study. We found that Raz and Pro were effective in a statistically significant manner with the 3 injection schedule of the 1, 5 and 9 day administrations on LLC . If we administered Raz to tumor-bearing mice once on day 1, 5 and 9, there was no difference between treatment and vehicle control. Antitumor effects of Raz in combination with Ble on LLC (73.3 %) were better than those in combination with Dau (56.3 %) (Table 5 and Table 6 ). Pro also showed synergistic effects in combination with Ble (Table 7 ). The influence of Pro and Raz on primary tumor of LLC (using Student T-test): Route: ip \u00d7 7 daily. Experiment term was 11 days. * P < 0.05 (treatment vs vehicle control). The numbers of mice were 30 for the control group and 20 for each treatment group. 100 % survival was observed in each group. The influence of Pro and Raz on primary and metastatic tumor of LLC: PTI (%) \u2013 Primary tumor inhibition. MFCPM \u2013 metastatic foci count per mouse. Route: ip \u00d7 7 every 2 days. Experiment term was 20 days, * P < 0.001(treatment vs vehicle control). The numbers of mice were 30 for both control group and each treatment group. 100 % survival was observed in each group. Antitumor effects of bisdioxopiperazines of different schedules on Lewis lung carcinoma: *Administration every 3 hours, 16 mice were included in each testing group. **p < 0.05 (treatment vs control), Experimental term was 11 days Antitumor effects of Raz on Lewis lung carcinoma in combination with daunorubicin: *Administration every 3 hours. Experimental term was 11 days Antitumor effects of Raz on Lewis lung carcinoma in combination with bleomycin: * Administrate every 3 hours in one day. ** p < 0.01 (treatment vs vehicle control). Experimental term was 11 days Antitumor effects of Pro on Lewis lung carcinoma in combination with daunorubicin or bleomycin: *Administration every 3 hours. Experimental term was 11 days The experiments showed that LAX-83 was sensitive to Raz (40\u201360 mgKg -1 , ip \u00d7 5) and Pro (80\u2013100 mgKg -1 ip \u00d7 5) with inhibitory rates of 25\u201332 % and 55\u201360 % respectively (P < 0.01 vs control). CTX , as a positive anticancer drug (40 mgKg -1 ip \u00d7 5), exhibited antitumor activities against the growth of LAX-83 with an inhibitory rate of 84 %. Obvious necrosis in tumor tissues was observed by histological evaluation of CTX and Pro treatment groups, but Pro showed larger vacuoles than CTX . Drug inhibition on tumor volumes were calculated and outlined in Table 8 . We have tested the 5 most commonly used anticancer drugs \u2013 cyclophosphamide (CTX), 5-fluoruoracil (5-Fu), methotrexate (MTX), cisplatin (DDP) and vincristine (VCR) (Table 9 ). In the LAX-83 model, CTX has been shown to be the most effective one. The anticancer effect of Pro was the same or better than those of MTX, DDP and as well as 5-Fu against LAX-83 tumor growth. Antitumor activities of Pro and Raz on human tumor LAX-83 using subrenal capsule assay: Route: ip \u00d7 5 daily from the day after surgery. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.001 (treatment vs vehicle control). Experiment was completed within 7 days. Tumor volume = 1/2 \u00d7 width 2 \u00d7 length (using T-test) Antitumor activities of anticancer drugs on human tumor LAX-83 using subrenal capsule assay: Route: ip \u00d7 5 daily from the day after surgery. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.001 (treatment vs vehicle control). Experiment was completed within 7 days. Tumor volume = 1/2 \u00d7 width 2 \u00d7 length (using T-test) Explanations of anticancer and antimetastatic mechanisms of bisdioxopiperazines are now inconclusive. The present explanation for the anticancer mechanisms of Raz has been attributed to antiangiogenesis and topoisomerase II inhibition.[ 16 ] Since the antimetastatic activities of Raz and Pro were much stronger than those actions against primary tumor growth, this special targeting on metastasis ought to be more useful in clinical cancer treatment. Raz and Pro show typical characteristics of antiangiogenesis agents, which target small nodule of tumors. Meanwhile, recent reports on drugs targeting angiogenesis indicate that most anti-vascular drugs have low or even no effects on most cancers when they are used alone in clinics, but they show synergistic effects in combination with other anticancer drugs. [ 17 , 18 ] Our study shows synergistic anticancer actions of Raz and Pro with Ble or Dau basing on this theory. Previous work showed that Pro and Raz could reduce the cardiotoxicity of anthrocycline ,[ 1 , 9 , 10 ] so we may reasonably deduce that they can also reduce the cytotoxicity of anthrocyclines . The data in our study suggests that the synergistic effects of Raz with anthrocyclines are present, but not as potent as those with Ble . Since we have tested the antitumor activity of clinically available anticancer drugs (CTX, 5-Fu, MTX, DDP and VCR) against LAX-83, CTX being the best one, two bisdioxopiperazines studied on this work show overall similar anticancer effective as commonly used drugs. Although the anticancer effects of CTX and VCR are better than those of Pro, for other commonly used drugs, such as DDP, MTX and 5-Fu, the antitumor effects are no better than those of Pro. Since the antitumor effects of MTX and DDP are even less effective than those of Pro and Raz , we suggest that anticancer effects of Pro and Raz are within the effective anticancer ranges of commonly available anticancer drugs. The other useful property of Pro is that it is the most water-soluble among the bisdioxopiperazines . Most bisdioxopiperazines are less water-soluble and given orally in clinics. Although oral administration is easy for patients, bioavailability varies from patient to patient. For some patients who have a poor absorption of bisdioxopiperazines in oral administration, Pro can be injected iv to maintain stable drug levels. Our previous work showed that Pro could strongly accumulate in tumor tissue while Pro levels in other tissues decrease rapidly [ 19 ]. Presently, a stereo-isomer of Raz , (dexrazoxane, ICRF-187 ), a water-soluble Raz, is being reinvestigated and has aroused the interests of clinical oncologists. Phase III clinical studies are currently underway in the US. More importantly, ICRF-187 was licensed in 28 countries in 4 continents. This work shows a noticeable inhibition of Pro and Raz on lung cancers and suggests possible usage of Raz and Pro on lung cancer in clinics. The advantages of bisdioxopiperazines in clinical treatment of lung cancers are as follows: (i) Pro and Raz can inhibit the growth of lung cancers, with and without the help of other anticancer drugs, like Dau and Ble ; (ii) like Raz , Pro strongly inhibits spontaneous pulmonary metastasis of LLC ; (iii) since Pro can inhibit CaM [ 11 ], a calcium activated protein that's associated with MDR and metastatic phenotypes, synergistic anticancer effects of Pro and Raz can be expected in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, like Dau or Ble . Now, new concepts of the relationship between tumor metastasis and MDR in cancers have been stated,[ 20 ] whereas bisdioxopiperazines can inhibit both tumor metastasis and MDR . As a counterpart of Raz , Pro might be of interest and have chemotherapeutic potential in clinics. Cyclophosphomide ( CTX ), daunorubicin ( Dau ) and bleomycin ( Ble ), 5-fluororacil (5-Fu), vincristine (VCR), cisplatin (DDP), methotrexate (MTX) were purchased from Shanghai Pharmaceutical Company. Pro and Raz were prepared by Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences. C57BL/6J and Kun-Min strain mice were purchased from Shanghai Center of Laboratory Animal Breeding, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Nude mice (Swiss-DF), taken from Roswell Park Memorial Institute, USA, were bred in Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences under a specific pathogen free condition. Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma xenograft ( LAX-83 )[ 21 ] and Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) were serially transplanted in this laboratory. All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Research Animals, NIH, established by Washington University's Animal Studies Committee. Bouin's solution consists of water saturated with picric acid: formaldehyde: glacial acetic acid (75: 20: 5, v/v/v). Mice of Kun-Min strain (equal amount of male and female) were ip injected with Pro and Raz daily for 10 successive days. The deaths of mice were counted after 1 month. Lethal dosage of agents was calculated by Random Probity tests . C57BL/6J mice were implanted sc with LLC (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) from donor mice. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs daily or every two days for 7 injections. On day 11 or day 20, mice were sacrificed, and locally growing tumors were separated from skin and muscles and weighed, and lungs of host mice were placed into a Bouin's solution for 24 h, and then the lung samples were submerged into a solution of 95 % alcohol for 24 h. Finally, the numbers of extruding metastatic foci in lungs were counted. C57BL/6J mice were implanted sc with LLC (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) from donor mice. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs on day 1, 5, 9. Single injection or 3 injections every 3 hours were used. Tumors were separated and weighed on day 11. Nude mice were inoculated with LAX-83 under the renal capsule (SRC method).[ 22 ] Nude mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs daily during next five days after inoculation of LAX-83 . Then nude mice were sacrificed, and their kidneys were taken out for measurement of tumor sizes using a stereomicroscope a week after transplantation. Tumor volume was calculated as 1/2(ab 2 ) where a and b are their major and minor axes of the lump. Kidneys with tumors were paraffin-embedded, sliced and hematoxylin dyed. The tumor tissues were then observed from a light microscope. Student's t-test was used to assess the differences between control and drug treatment groups of above methods.

Pro and Raz are bisdioxopiperazine compounds. In this work, we evaluated the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of Pro and Raz in vivo against two lung tumor models, one of murine origin (Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC) and one of human origin (LAX-83). After determining the lethal dosage of Pro and Raz, we assessed and compared the inhibitory effects of Pro and Raz against primary tumor growth and metastatic occurrences of LLC at the dosage of LD5. Pro and Raz were active against primary tumor growth and significantly inhibited pulmonary metastasis of LLC at same dose-ranges (inhibitory rates > 90 %). Both Raz and Pro were effective in 1, 5, and 9 day administration schedules. Three different schedules of Raz and Pro were effective against the primary tumor growth of LLC (35\u201350 %). The synergistic anticancer effect of Raz with bleomycin (Ble) (from 41.3 % to 73.3 %) was more obvious than those with daunorubicin (Dau) (from 33.1 % to 56.3 %) in the LLC tumor model. Pro was also seen to have synergistic anti-cancer effects with Ble in the LLC model. Both Raz and Pro inhibited the growth of LAX 83 in a statistically significant manner. These data suggest that both Raz and Pro may have anti-tumor potentiality and Raz and Pro have combinative effects with Ble or Dau. The potential targets of bisdioxopiperazines may include lung cancers, especially on tumor metastasis. The anti-cancer effects of Raz and Pro can be increased with the help of other anticancer drugs.\n\nRazoxane (ICRF-159) ( Raz ), first developed in UK, was the earliest agent against spontaneous metastasis for the murine model (Lewis lung carcinoma) in 1969 [ 1 ]. A large volume of papers and projects have been published in the utilities and mechanisms of Raz for anticancer actions, like assisting radiotherapy, [ 2 ] overcoming multi-drug resistance (MDR) of daunorubicin and doxorubicin [ 3 ], inhibiting topoisomerase II [ 4 ] and so on. More importantly, Raz , as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines, has been licensed in 28 countries in 4 continents. Since morpholine groups in some structures were reported to be responsible for cytotoxic or modulative actions on tumors, an anticancer agent, probimane [1,2-bis (N 4 -morpholine-3, 5-dioxopeprazine-1-yl) propane; AT-2153, Pro] was synthesized by introducing two morpholine groups into Raz in China.[ 5 ]. Raz and Pro belong to bisdiopiperazines . Like Raz , Pro also exhibits anti-tumor activity both in vivo and in vitro against experimental tumor models in a small scale investigation [ 6 , 7 ] and limited clinical data showed that Pro could inhibit human malignant lymphoma even for those resistant to other anticancer drugs [ 8 ]. Pro exhibits the same pharmacological effects as Raz , like detoxication of Adriamycin ( ADR ) induced cardiotoxicities, and synergism with ADR against tumors [ 9 , 10 ]. We have found some novel biological effects of Pro , like inhibiting the activity of calmodulin ( CaM ), a cell-signal regulator, which can explain anticancer actions and the combined cytotoxic effect of Pro and ADR [ 11 ]. Pro was also shown to inhibit lipoperoxidation ( LPO ) of erythrocytes [ 12 ], influence tumor sialic acid synthesis [ 13 ] and inhibit the binding of fibrinogen to leukemia cells [ 14 ]. Lung cancer is the No 1 killer among all categories of cancers in urban areas in China and many Western countries. The high mortality rate of lung cancer can easily be caused by inducing multi-drug resistance ( MDR ) and by high metastatic occurrence in clinics [ 15 ]. Since we assume that Pro , like Raz may possess useful therapeutic potentialities, we evaluated in vivo the chemotherapeutical parameters of Pro and Raz for lung cancer of both murine and human origins. The lethal dosage of Pro and Raz is tabulated in Table 1 . Since the toxicity of Pro and Raz seemed to lack sex specificity in mice, we were able to combine their numbers for LD 50 and LD 5 calculations. We used the approximate dosage of LD 5 of Pro (60 mg/kg ip \u00d7 7) and Raz (20 mg/kg ip \u00d7 7) as equitoxic dosages for further treatment studies. The subacute toxicity of Pro and Raz in mice: Mouse survival was observed for 1 month. The numbers of mice in each group were 20 for each of the 5 dosages of a single agent. Antitumor and antimetastatic effects of Pro and Raz on LLC are tabulated in Table 2 and Table 3 . Pro and Raz at equitoxic dosages (LD 5 ) showed a noticeable anticancer effect on primary tumor growth (inhibitory rates, approximately 30\u201345 %), and significantly inhibited the formation of tumor metastases (inhibitory rates on pulmonary metastasis > 90 %, P < 0.001). Primary tumor growth of LLC was inhibited more by Pro (48 %) than by Raz (40.3%) in a 20 day trial, whereas the inhibition of Pro (35.7%) was slightly less than that of Raz (40 %) on an 11 day trial. Pro seems to be more persistent than Raz in inhibiting primary tumor growth of LLC . Antitumor effects of Raz and Pro on LLC are included in Table 4 , 5 , 6 . We evaluated 1, 5 and 9 day administration schedules in our study. We found that Raz and Pro were effective in a statistically significant manner with the 3 injection schedule of the 1, 5 and 9 day administrations on LLC . If we administered Raz to tumor-bearing mice once on day 1, 5 and 9, there was no difference between treatment and vehicle control. Antitumor effects of Raz in combination with Ble on LLC (73.3 %) were better than those in combination with Dau (56.3 %) (Table 5 and Table 6 ). Pro also showed synergistic effects in combination with Ble (Table 7 ). The influence of Pro and Raz on primary tumor of LLC (using Student T-test): Route: ip \u00d7 7 daily. Experiment term was 11 days. * P < 0.05 (treatment vs vehicle control). The numbers of mice were 30 for the control group and 20 for each treatment group. 100 % survival was observed in each group.

CTX , as a positive anticancer drug (40 mgKg -1 ip \u00d7 5), exhibited antitumor activities against the growth of LAX-83 with an inhibitory rate of 84 %. Obvious necrosis in tumor tissues was observed by histological evaluation of CTX and Pro treatment groups, but Pro showed larger vacuoles than CTX . Drug inhibition on tumor volumes were calculated and outlined in Table 8 . We have tested the 5 most commonly used anticancer drugs \u2013 cyclophosphamide (CTX), 5-fluoruoracil (5-Fu), methotrexate (MTX), cisplatin (DDP) and vincristine (VCR) (Table 9 ).",

Experiment was completed within 7 days. Tumor volume = 1/2 \u00d7 width 2 \u00d7 length (using T-test) Explanations of anticancer and antimetastatic mechanisms of bisdioxopiperazines are now inconclusive. The present explanation for the anticancer mechanisms of Raz has been attributed to antiangiogenesis and topoisomerase II inhibition.[ 16 ] Since the antimetastatic activities of Raz and Pro were much stronger than those actions against primary tumor growth, this special targeting on metastasis ought to be more useful in clinical cancer treatment. Raz and Pro show typical characteristics of antiangiogenesis agents, which target small nodule of tumors. Meanwhile, recent reports on drugs targeting angiogenesis indicate that most anti-vascular drugs have low or even no effects on most cancers when they are used alone in clinics, but they show synergistic effects in combination with other anticancer drugs. [ 17 , 18 ] Our study shows synergistic anticancer actions of Raz and Pro with Ble or Dau basing on this theory. Previous work showed that Pro and Raz could reduce the cardiotoxicity of anthrocycline ,[ 1 , 9 , 10 ] so we may reasonably deduce that they can also reduce the cytotoxicity of anthrocyclines . The data in our study suggests that the synergistic effects of Raz with anthrocyclines are present, but not as potent as those with Ble . Since we have tested the antitumor activity of clinically available anticancer drugs (CTX, 5-Fu, MTX, DDP and VCR) against LAX-83, CTX being the best one, two bisdioxopiperazines studied on this work show overall similar anticancer effective as commonly used drugs. Although the anticancer effects of CTX and VCR are better than those of Pro, for other commonly used drugs, such as DDP, MTX and 5-Fu, the antitumor effects are no better than those of Pro. Since the antitumor effects of MTX and DDP are even less effective than those of Pro and Raz , we suggest that anticancer effects of Pro and Raz are within the effective anticancer ranges of commonly available anticancer drugs. The other useful property of Pro is that it is the most water-soluble among the bisdioxopiperazines . Most bisdioxopiperazines are less water-soluble and given orally in clinics. Although oral administration is easy for patients, bioavailability varies from patient to patient. For some patients who have a poor absorption of bisdioxopiperazines in oral administration, Pro can be injected iv to maintain stable drug levels. Our previous work showed that Pro could strongly accumulate in tumor tissue while Pro levels in other tissues decrease rapidly [ 19 ]. Presently, a stereo-isomer of Raz , (dexrazoxane, ICRF-187 ), a water-soluble Raz, is being reinvestigated and has aroused the interests of clinical oncologists. Phase III clinical studies are currently underway in the US. More importantly, ICRF-187 was licensed in 28 countries in 4 continents. This work shows a noticeable inhibition of Pro and Raz on lung cancers and suggests possible usage of Raz and Pro on lung cancer in clinics. The advantages of bisdioxopiperazines in clinical treatment of lung cancers are as follows: (i) Pro and Raz can inhibit the growth of lung cancers, with and without the help of other anticancer drugs, like Dau and Ble ; (ii) like Raz , Pro strongly inhibits spontaneous pulmonary metastasis of LLC ; (iii) since Pro can inhibit CaM [ 11 ], a calcium activated protein that's associated with MDR and metastatic phenotypes, synergistic anticancer effects of Pro and Raz can be expected in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, like Dau or Ble . Now, new concepts of the relationship between tumor metastasis and MDR in cancers have been stated,[ 20 ] whereas bisdioxopiperazines can inhibit both tumor metastasis and MDR . As a counterpart of Raz , Pro might be of interest and have chemotherapeutic potential in clinics. Cyclophosphomide ( CTX ), daunorubicin ( Dau ) and bleomycin ( Ble ), 5-fluororacil (5-Fu), vincristine (VCR), cisplatin (DDP), methotrexate (MTX) were purchased from Shanghai Pharmaceutical Company. Pro and Raz were prepared by Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences. C57BL/6J and Kun-Min strain mice were purchased from Shanghai Center of Laboratory Animal Breeding, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Nude mice (Swiss-DF), taken from Roswell Park Memorial Institute, USA, were bred in Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences under a specific pathogen free condition. Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma xenograft ( LAX-83 )[ 21 ] and Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) were serially transplanted in this laboratory. All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Research Animals, NIH, established by Washington University's Animal Studies Committee. Bouin's solution consists of water saturated with picric acid: formaldehyde: glacial acetic acid (75: 20: 5, v/v/v). Mice of Kun-Min strain (equal amount of male and female) were ip injected with Pro and Raz daily for 10 successive days. The deaths of mice were counted after 1 month. Lethal dosage of agents was calculated by Random Probity tests . C57BL/6J mice were implanted sc with LLC (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) from donor mice. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs daily or every two days for 7 injections. On day 11 or day 20, mice were sacrificed, and locally growing tumors were separated from skin and muscles and weighed, and lungs of host mice were placed into a Bouin's solution for 24 h, and then the lung samples were submerged into a solution of 95 % alcohol for 24 h. Finally, the numbers of extruding metastatic foci in lungs were counted. C57BL/6J mice were implanted sc with LLC (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) from donor mice. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs on day 1, 5, 9. Single injection or 3 injections every 3 hours were used. Tumors were separated and weighed on day 11. Nude mice were inoculated with LAX-83 under the renal capsule (SRC method).[ 22 ] Nude mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs daily during next five days after inoculation of LAX-83 . Then nude mice were sacrificed, and their kidneys were taken out for measurement of tumor sizes using a stereomicroscope a week after transplantation. Tumor volume was calculated as 1/2(ab 2 ) where a and b are their major and minor axes of the lump. Kidneys with tumors were paraffin-embedded, sliced and hematoxylin dyed. The tumor tissues were then observed from a light microscope. Student's t-test was used to assess the differences between control and drug treatment groups of above methods.

          "Perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to weight maintenance among young women: A community survey [Chunk 2]\n\nYoung women are a group at high risk of weight gain. This study examined a range of perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance among young women, and how these varied by socioeconomic status (SES), overweight status and domestic situation. In October-December 2001, a total of 445 women aged 18\u201332 years, selected randomly from the Australian electoral roll, completed a mailed self-report survey that included questions on 11 barriers to physical activity and 11 barriers to healthy eating (relating to personal, social and environmental factors). Height, weight and socio-demographic details were also obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost. Women with children were particularly likely to report a lack of social support as an important barrier to physical activity, and lack of social support and time as important barriers to healthy eating. Perceived barriers did not differ by SES or overweight status. Health promotion strategies aimed at preventing weight gain should take into account the specific perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating faced by women in this age group, particularly lack of motivation, lack of time, and cost. Strategies targeting perceived lack of time and lack of social support are particularly required for young women with children.\n\nh item showed the largest loading. The Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficients for the three factors ranged from 0.68 to 0.76, indicating moderate internal reliability. Provisional names were assigned for these three factors: 'personal barriers', 'social support barriers' and 'environmental barriers'. The items included as personal barriers to physical activity were related to motivation, enjoyment, and skill. Social support barriers encompassed lack of support from family and friends; and environmental barriers related to information, access, cost, and time. The principal components analysis of the 11 barriers to healthy eating resulted in two distinct interpretable factors with eigenvalues greater than one (Table 2 ). The Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficients for the two factors were 0.72 and 0.83, indicating moderate to good internal reliability. Together the two factors explained 53% of the total variance. Provisional names were assigned to these factors: 'personal and environmental barriers' and 'social and environmental barriers'. Personal and environmental barriers to healthy eating included motivation, enjoyment, skills, information, cost, and access. Social and environmental barriers were related to lack of support from family and friends and time constraints. Mean factor scores did not vary according to women's overweight status or SES. Mean factor scores did differ significantly by domestic situation for two factors: social support barriers to physical activity and social and environmental barriers to healthy eating (see Table 3 ). Compared with women living in other domestic situations, women with children had the lowest score on the social support for physical activity factor, suggesting that lack of support from partners, children and friends was a more important perceived barrier to physical activity for these women. This group also had the lowest score on social and environmental barriers to healthy eating factor, suggesting that lack of social support and insufficient time were more important perceived barriers to healthy eating among women with children than among other women. Conversely, young women who lived with their parents had the highest scores on these factors, indicating the relative lack of importance of social support for physical activity, and social and environmental barriers to healthy eating, for this group. Mean standardized factor scores on weight maintenance by domestic situation a a . A large positive score represents more important barriers; a large negative score, less important barriers. This study suggests that a lack of motivation, time constraints due to work, and cost issues are the key perceived barriers to maintaining weight faced by young women. Overall these findings support other research that has examined barriers to physical activity and healthy eating [ 18 , 22 , 25 , 39 ]. However, the present study is unique in providing an insight into the relative importance of a range of personal, social and environmental factors as perceived barriers to weight maintenance among young women, a high risk group for weight gain. Findings showed that young women tended to rate personal factors as key perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating, followed by environmental factors, with social factors rated as less important. While the environment is likely to be an important source of influence on obesity-related behaviours [ 40 ], these findings highlight that efforts to prevent obesity should not ignore the central role of cognitive factors. Given the striking similarities in the types of barriers reported to impede physical activity, and the perceived barriers to healthy eating, findings also suggest that there may be potential economies of scale in health promotion programs aimed at preventing weight gain among young women. For example, strategies aimed at boosting motivation for healthy behaviour may help to promote both increased physical activity and healthy eating simultaneously. While motivating young healthy women to adopt healthy eating and physical activity behaviors is likely to be challenging, recent intervention research suggests that motivationally-tailored interventions may be more successful that other approaches (e.g. based on social-cognitive theory) in promoting physical activity and healthy eating [ 41 , 42 ]. It is noteworthy that perceived barriers to weight maintenance did not vary by socio-economic status or overweight status in this sample of women. In contrast, previous research has shown that overweight men and women face a number of perceived physical activity barriers [ 32 ]. Similarly, given that diet varies by socio-economic status [ 43 , 44 ] we expected that women of lower socio-economic status would be more likely to experience barriers to eating a healthy diet. Previous studies also suggest that persons of low SES often live in areas where the cost of food is greater, and access to healthy foods is poorer [ 30 , 31 ]. The reasons for the difference between the present results and earlier findings are unclear. It may be, however, that in this sample of relatively young women, many were still acquiring their education, and hence any SES differences in perceived barriers to healthy behaviours were not yet established. Compared to other young women, those living with children were the most likely to report lack of social support for physical activity, and lack of support and time for healthy eating, as key perceived barriers to maintaining their weight. Young women who lived with their parents were the least likely to perceive these to be barriers to weight maintenance. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies showing that getting married and having children are associated with decreased physical activity and greater weight gain [ 21 , 26 ]. Any weight gain prevention program targeting women with children should incorporate a focus on enlisting social support for both physical activity, and shopping for and preparing healthy foods. In a previous study with the same sample, we reported that while the majority of the women were in a healthy weight range (51%) or overweight/obese (31%), 18% of the women were underweight [ 21 ]. It should be acknowledged that some women in this sample, particularly those who were underweight, may have been trying to gain weight. One limitation of the present study was that the questions assessing perceived barriers to weight maintenance did not distinguish women trying to keep their weight down, from those trying to keep their weight up, and interpretation of the questions on perceived barriers may have been slightly different between these groups. However, attempts to gain weight are relatively uncommon among young women [ 45 ], and hence this is likely to have affected only a small proportion of the sample. A second limitation of this study is that the barriers were not assessed objectively, but rather through self-reports (ie perceived barriers). Nonetheless, it is important to consider women's perceptions of factors hindering their efforts to engage in healthy behaviours, since objective barriers may be perceived differently by different women (e.g., poor access to a gym may be viewed as less of a barrier to physical activity among a woman who walks for exercise than one who prefers aerobics). Finally, although the study achieved a somewhat modest response rate, the sample was selected from a nationally representative sampling frame and the socio-demographic profile of women was comparable to that of similarly-aged women in the wider population [ 35 ]. The findings of this study highlight the need for health promotion strategies that provide increased motivation, support and skills to enable young women to shop and prepare healthy, quick and inexpensive meals. Similarly, the findings suggest a need to promote more time-efficient physical activity alternatives.",
          "Imbalance in the health workforce [Chunk 0]\n\nImbalance in the health workforce is a major concern in both developed and developing countries. It is a complex issue that encompasses a wide range of possible situations. This paper aims to contribute not only to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature, but also to the development of an analytical framework. The framework emphasizes the number and types of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, and facilitates the development of policy tools and their assessment. Moreover, to facilitate comparisons between health workforce imbalances, a typology of imbalances is proposed that differentiates between profession/specialty imbalances, geographical imbalances, institutional and services imbalances and gender imbalances.\n\nImbalance in the health workforce\n\nImbalance in the health workforce is a major concern in both developed and developing countries.

The framework emphasizes the number and types of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, and facilitates the development of policy tools and their assessment. Moreover, to facilitate comparisons between health workforce imbalances, a typology of imbalances is proposed that differentiates between profession/specialty imbalances, geographical imbalances, institutional and services imbalances and gender imbalances.\n\nImbalance in the health workforce is a major challenge for health policy-makers, since human resources \u2013 the different kinds of clinical and non-clinical staff who make each individual and public health intervention happen \u2013 are the most important of the health system's inputs [ 1 ]. Imbalance is not a new issue, as nursing shortages were reported in hospitals in the United States of America as early as 1915 [ 2 ]. It remains a major concern to this day, reported in both developed and developing countries and for most of the health care professions. Although imbalance in the health workforce is an important issue for policy-makers, various elements contribute to obscuring policy development. First, many reports of shortages are not borne out by the evidence. Rosenfeld and Moses [ 3 ] show that an overwhelming majority of newspapers, journals and newsletter articles describing the nursing situation in the United States presume the existence of a shortage. They found that even in those areas where concrete evidence of a shortage was not available, the term \"nursing shortage\" still appeared. Second, the notion of shortage is a relative one: what is considered a nursing shortage in Europe would probably be viewed differently from an African perspective. Finally, imbalances are of different types and their impact on the health care system varies. In consequence, there is a general need to critically review the imbalance issue. The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature and the development of an analytical framework. There are various approaches to defining imbalances [ 4 ]. From an economic perspective, a skill imbalance (shortage/surplus) occurs when the quantity of a given skill supplied by the workforce and the quantity demanded by employers diverge at the existing market conditions [ 5 ]. Labour market supplies and demands for occupational skills fluctuate continuously, so at times there will be imbalances in the labour market. In other words, a shortage/surplus is the result of a disequilibrium between the demand and supply for labour. In contrast, non-economic definitions are usually normative, i.e. there is a shortage of labour relative to defined norms [ 6 ]. In the case of health personnel, these definitions are based either on a value judgement \u2013 for instance, how much care people should receive \u2013 or on a professional determination \u2013 such as deciding what is the appropriate number of physicians for the general population. One of the key questions regarding imbalances is how long these last: Is the imbalance temporary or permanent? In a competitive labour market, we should expect most imbalances to be resolved over time. Imbalances will tend to disappear faster the greater the reaction speed and also the greater the elasticity of supply (or demand) [ 7 ]. This type of imbalance (shortage or surplus) is defined as dynamic. In contrast, a static imbalance occurs because supply does not increase or decrease; market equilibrium is therefore not achieved. For instance, wage adjustments may respond slowly to shifts in demand or supply as a result of institutional and regulatory arrangements, imperfect market competition (monopoly, monopsony) and wage-control policies. Another example is physicians' education: because of the length of time required to educate physicians, changes in available supply take a long time to react significantly. Lack of information on the state of the various labour markets can also be a factor in the speed of market adjustment. To make proper labour market decisions, households and firms must be informed of the existing market conditions across markets. They must therefore know what wages are paid and the nature and location of job openings and available workers. Moreover, we should also differentiate between qualitative and quantitative imbalance. In a tight labour market, employers might not find the ideal candidate, but will still recruit someone. Under these conditions, the issue is the quality of job candidates rather than the quantity of people willing and able to do the job [ 8 ]. From the employers' perspective, a shortage of workers exists; from the job-market perspective, the existence of a shortage could be questioned because the jobs are filled. One negative hidden impact of a qualitative shortage is the number of positions that are filled with ineffective individuals [ 9 ]. To better understand the role of factors affecting health workforce imbalances and to facilitate the development of policy tools, a conceptual framework is presented in this section. Factors affecting health workforce imbalances are numerous and complex, but focusing on crucial elements should permit insight into the issue of health workforce imbalances. The framework is depicted in Fig. 1 and contains six main components: the demand for health labour, the supply of health labour, the health care system, policies, resources and \"global\" factors. Framework for imbalance of human resources for health Central to this framework are the demand for and supply of health labour. Also included in the framework is the health care system, and in particular, some of its features that are likely to have an impact on health workforce imbalances. Policies constitute another crucial element of the framework. In effect, health policies but also non-health-oriented policies can have an impact on health workforce imbalances. The framework also incorporates financial, physical and knowledge resources that contribute to model the health workforce.Finally, \"global\" factors such as economic, sociodemographic, political, geographical and cultural factors are included. These elements contribute directly or indirectly to shaping and transforming the entire society and hence the health workforce. The first element of the framework to be examined is the demand for health personnel. The demand for health personnel can be considered as a derived demand for health services. Accordingly, we should consider factors determining the demand for health services. Personal characteristics \u2013 such as health needs, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics \u2013 and economic factors play an important role. It has often been proposed that the planning of human resources for health be based solely on estimates of health needs in the population [ 10 ]. However, relying only on the concept of need is difficult, because it can be defined either broadly or restrictedly and accordingly lead to a perception of either systematic shortage or surplus. Health needs is only one of the factors affecting the demand for health personnel. Several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of economic factors on the demand for health care. In particular in the United States, studies have attempted to estimate price and income elasticities of demand for medical services [ 11 - 13 ]. Measurements of price or income elasticities make it possible to evaluate the impact of a change in price or income on the demand for health care.",

Instead, they primarily focus on the role of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in the development of B cell lymphomas and the influence of antigen stimulation on lymphomagenesis in mouse models.\n\nTo answer the question about how vaccines work in the immune system, additional information is needed, which typically includes the following points:\n\n1. **Introduction of Antigens**: Vaccines introduce harmless components of a pathogen, such as proteins or inactivated/dead parts of the virus or bacterium, into the body. This exposure helps the immune system recognize these components (antigens).\n\n2. **Immune Response Activation**: Upon receiving the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the antigens as foreign, prompting an immune response. This includes the activation of B cells, which produce antibodies specific to the antigens, and T cells, which help in identifying and destroying infected cells.\n\n3. **Memory Cell Formation**: After the initial immune response, the body creates memory B cells and memory T cells that remain in the body long-term. These cells \"remember\" the specific antigens.\n\n4. **Rapid Response Upon Real Infection**: If the individual is later exposed to the actual pathogen, the immune system can respond more quickly and effectively due to the memory cells, often preventing illness or reducing its severity.\n\n5. **Types of Vaccines**: Vaccines can be live-attenuated, inactivated, subunit, or mRNA-based, each working slightly differently but ultimately aiming to elicit a protective immune response.\n\nTo summarize, while the provided context documents discuss aspects of B cell activation and lymphomagenesis, they do not cover the mechanisms of vaccine action or the immune system's response to vaccines.

          "The B Cell Antigen Receptor and Overexpression of \n\nA variety of circumstantial evidence from humans has implicated the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in the genesis of B cell lymphomas. We generated mouse models designed to test this possibility directly, and we found that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated state of a clonal BCR affected the rate and outcome of lymphomagenesis initiated by the proto-oncogene MYC. The tumors that arose in the presence of constitutive BCR differed from those initiated by MYC alone and resembled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (B-CLL), whereas those that arose in response to antigen stimulation resembled large B-cell lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma (BL). We linked the genesis of the BL-like tumors to antigen stimulus in three ways. First, in reconstruction experiments, stimulation of B cells by an autoantigen in the presence of overexpressed MYC gave rise to BL-like tumors that were, in turn, dependent on both MYC and the antigen for survival and proliferation. Second, genetic disruption of the pathway that mediates signaling from the BCR promptly killed cells of the BL-like tumors as well as the tumors resembling B-CLL. And third, growth of the murine BL could be inhibited by any of three distinctive immunosuppressants, in accord with the dependence of the tumors on antigen-induced signaling. Together, our results provide direct evidence that antigenic stimulation can participate in lymphomagenesis, point to a potential role for the constitutive BCR as well, and sustain the view that the constitutive BCR gives rise to signals different from those elicited by antigen.

The mouse models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas, and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics.\n\nMalignancies affecting the B cell lineage comprise the vast majority of human lymphomas [ 1 ]. There are at least 15 different types of B cell lymphomas (BCLs), differing in clinical behavior, biological phenotype, pathogenesis, and response to treatment. Irrespective of their type, however, most BCLs share two features: chromosomal translocations that involve an immunoglobulin gene and one or another proto-oncogene [ 2 ], and expression of a B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Chromosomal translocations have long been considered crucial to the pathogenesis of the tumors. But there is now increasing evidence that signaling from the BCR may be a coconspirator in that pathogenesis (for a review, see [ 3 ]). A BCR is expressed on normal B cells throughout the course of their development, and this expression appears to be essential for survival of the cells [ 4 ]. There is controversy, however, about whether the life-sustaining signal from the BCR is autogenous in nature or arises from antigenic stimulus [ 5 ]. The BCR expressed by BCLs is also apparently required for survival of the tumor cells and may drive cellular proliferation [ 6 ]. More than 40 years ago, Damashek and Schwartz proposed that antigenic stimulus might contribute to the genesis of BCLs in the context of autoimmune disease [ 7 ]. In the interim, circumstantial evidence has mounted to support a role for antigen stimulation in diverse forms of lymphomagenesis. For example, in some instances, the structure of the BCR on BCLs shows evidence of having been subjected to antigen selection [ 8 \u2013 14 ], and may even bind a known antigen\u2014either a protein encoded by a virus suspected of being an etiological agent, or an autoantigen [ 15 , 16 ]. We sought to test directly the role of the BCR in the genesis of BCLs by reconstruction in mouse models. We used a series of transgenic mice that allowed cooperation between either the constitutive or antigen-activated BCR with the proto-oncogene MYC , the activation of which by chromosomal translocation has been implicated in the genesis of human diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) [ 17 \u2013 19 ]. We derived these models from two strains of mice that express transgenes of MYC in the lymphoid lineage. In one strain (E\u03bc- MYC ), transcription of the transgene is driven by the control element for the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene [ 20 ]; in the other strain (MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC ), the MYC transgene is also transcribed in the B cell lineage, but the transcription is governed by a tetracycline responsive control element and can be repressed by administration of tetracycline or an analogue, doxycycline [ 21 \u2013 23 ]. We modified these transgenic strains so that their B-cell repertoire was dominated by a mature BCR for the antigen hen egg lysozyme (HEL), by breeding in a transgene for that receptor (BCR HEL ), whose expression was targeted to the B cell lineage [ 24 ]. We could then provide an antigenic stimulus by breeding in a transgene that produced a soluble version of the normally membrane-bound antigen (sHEL) [ 25 ]. This set of mouse models allowed us to examine whether either autogenous or antigen-induced signaling from the BCR could cooperate with overexpressed MYC in the initiation and maintenance of BCLs. Our results suggest that both forms of signaling from the BCR can cooperate with overexpressed MYC in tumorigenesis. The tumors that arose in mice expressing both BCR HEL and sHEL differed from those found in E\u03bc- MYC mice, and bore a striking resemblance to BL. Reconstruction experiments demonstrated that both the survival and proliferation of these tumors was dependent upon the cognate autoantigen for the BCR. We also found that BCR HEL itself could cooperate with MYC in tumorigenesis. The resulting tumors differed from both those in the E\u03bc- MYC mice and those in E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice, and resembled a subset of chronic B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). We attribute the phenotype of the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors to autogenous signaling from the BCR [ 4 , 26 ]. The requirement for continuous BCR signals in the maintenance of either the murine BL-like tumors or the B-CLL\u2013like tumors was authenticated by genetic and pharmacological disruption of signaling from the BCR. Our findings provide experimental support for previous suggestions that both autogenous and antigen-stimulated signaling from the BCR can contribute to lymphomagenesis; provide a direct demonstration that autoantigenic stimulation can contribute to lymphomagenesis; and sustain the view that the constitutive BCR gives rise to autogenous signals that differ from those elicited by antigen. This is also the first report, to our knowledge, in which the potential contributions of constitutive and antigen-stimulated BCR to lymphomagenesis are compared. The models that are dependent upon autoantigenic stimulation bear a close resemblance to human large BCLs, and to BL, in particular. The results also raise the possibility that interruption of signaling from the BCR may have therapeutic value in the treatment of BCLs that express the receptor. The animal models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics for lymphomas. To test the role of BCR signaling in lymphomagenesis, we generated mice containing B cells that both overexpressed MYC and had a known antigenic specificity at a high frequency. To that end, we bred a transgene for BCR HEL into E\u03bc- MYC mice, creating a strain designated E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL . Expression of the E\u03bc- MYC and BCR HEL transgenes was targeted to the B cell lineage [ 20 , 25 ]. Mice that express the E\u03bc- MYC transgene alone appear developmentally normal at first [ 27 ], but later accumulate a large number of polyclonal Pre/Pro-B cells (B220+, CD43+, IgM\u2013, IgD\u2013) in their bone marrow, and eventually also in their peripheral lymphoid organs, from which a monoclonal Pre/Pro BCL arises [ 20 ]. In contrast, the bone marrow and lymph nodes of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice contained normal numbers of mature B cells, which expressed BCR HEL on their surface (unpublished data). Thus, the developmental arrest normally observed in E\u03bc- MYC mice was apparently corrected by the introduction of an antigen receptor transgene, in accord with previous results [ 28 ]. The E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice provided a means to test for cooperation between signaling from the BCR and overexpression of MYC in the genesis of lymphoid tumors. The E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice developed fatal lymphomas more rapidly than did E\u03bc- MYC mice ( Figure 1 A), and the anatomical distribution of the tumor was different ( Figure 2 ). These observations are based on the detailed analysis of tumor that arose in 80 individual mice, maintained in three different animal facilities in two institutions. We consistently observed this phenotype in the tumors, in spite of previous reports of some low frequency of mature B cell malignancies [ 29 , 30 ]. The emergence of tumors was followed in three ways: by anatomical inspection, by counting the total number of cells in organs ( Figure 2 ), and by flow cytometric analysis to enumerate B cells carrying BCR HEL ( Figure S1 ). (A) Survival. Strains of mice in groups of 50 were observed over a period of 36 wk. Deceased mice were examined by necropsy. Death was uniformly attributable to lymphoid tumors. The difference among the mortality curves for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice and that of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL transgenic mice to each other had a significance value p = 0.05. The difference between the mortality curves for those two sets of mice and the other mice represented in the graph was p = 0.005. In addition, the statistical significance of the difference between the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL transgenic mice and any other groups of mice presented in the graph is p < 0.01. (B) Jaw tumor in 16-wk-old MMTV-rtTA/TRE-M YC /BCR HEL /sHEL mouse. Single-cell suspensions were generated from lymph nodes (six nodes for each mouse \u2013 a pair of inguinal, axillary and brachial lymph nodes), spleens, thymii and jaw-tumors. The bar graphs represent the total number of cells (x10 \u22126 ) obtained for the indicated organs. Counts represent the mean derived from 10 independent mice \u00b1 the standard deviation for those values. Healthy animals were euthanized at 21 d of age, E\u03bc- MYC mice at 200\u2013240 d, E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice at 112\u2013130 d, E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice at 26\u201330 d, and MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /sHEL/BCR HEL mice at 71\u201386 d. All tumors contained homogeneous populations of cells with distinctive surface phenotypes: B220+/IgM- cells for E\u03bc- MYC tumors, B220+/IgM a + cells for both E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, and B220+/BCR HEL cells for MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. Open bars represent normal mice. Filled bars represent tumor-bearing mice. Evidence of tumor in E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice appeared first in the spleen at about 18 wk of age, then in lymph nodes and the bone marrow. Histological examination of the tumors revealed a diffuse and homogeneous population of small lymphocytes ( Figure 3 C and 3 H). Analysis with a panel of cell-surface markers identified the tumor cells as mature but na\u00efve B cells, reminiscent of those found in a subset of human B-CLL ( Table 1 and Figure S1 ), whereas the E\u03bc- MYC tumors were composed of Pre/Pro B-cells ( Table 1 , in accord with [ 20 ]). In addition, the tumors in E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice appear to be mature na\u00efve B cells that are CD5\u2013. In human B-CLL, the two main subsets are CD5+ and CD5\u2013. Tumors composed of mature, na\u00efve B cells also arose in MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL mice that had not been exposed to doxycycline (unpublished data). Those mice overexpress MYC from a different control element, but developed the same sort of tumors as observed with the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL transgenes ( Table 1 and Table S1 ). We conclude that a constitutive BCR can cooperate with MYC in the genesis of BCLs and can elicit a distinctive phenotype in the tumor cells. We attribute the findings to a previously described form of autogenous signaling from the BCR [ 4 , 26 ] (See Discussion ). Tissues were sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and microscopic images obtained as described in Methods. Magnification was 10X for (A\u2013E), 100X for (F\u2013J).

Cell-Surface Markers of BCLs To explore how antigen stimulation of BCR HEL might affect tumorigenesis by MYC , we bred a ubiquitously expressed transgene for sHEL into the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL background. The resulting strain (E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL) developed tumors even more rapidly than did E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice ( Figure 1 A). Overgrowth of B cells could be detected in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus ( Figure 2 ). B cells also infiltrated the liver, lungs, and central nervous system. Compression and invasion of the spinal cord caused paralysis of the hind and fore limbs. Histological examination revealed a homogeneous population of large lymphocytes in the spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, and bone marrow. The sheets of cells had a \u201cstarry sky\u201d appearance ( Figure 3 D and 3 I) that is common among large BCLs and is a prominent feature of BL [ 31 ]. This designation results from the presence of sheets of monomorphic cells interspersed with macrophages that have engulfed apoptotic cells. When examined for surface markers, the tumor cells closely resembled mature, activated B lymphocytes that have experienced the germinal center (GC). Further evidence for the GC origins of these cells will be presented below. As expected, the tumor cells were specific for HEL, as evidenced by their ability to bind the antigen ( Table 1 ). We also bred the BCR HEL and sHEL transgenes into a second strain of mice that expresses MYC in the B cell lineage (MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC )(see Introduction and Materials and Methods). The final composite strain was designated MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL. We originally created these mice for other purposes, but the manner in which they developed tumors proved noteworthy for the present context. The mice died somewhat later than the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice, but earlier than the other strains analyzed in the present study ( Figure 1 A). In a striking departure from our previous experience, however, tumors appeared first in the jaw, in a randomly unilateral manner ( Figure 1 B). The mice eventually developed a more generalized disease, with tumor cells appearing in multiple lymphoid organs and infiltrating nonlymphoid tissues as well ( Figure 2 and unpublished data). We observed this phenotype in 53 of 60 mice that were analyzed. The remaining seven mice in that cohort of 60 animals was only found to be sick at a very advanced stage of the disease, so we can not formally state that they initially presented with a randomly unilateral tumor in the jaw. The histological appearance of the tumors was similar to that of the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, including a starry sky appearance ( Figure 3 E and 3 J). The surface phenotype of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor cells also resembled that of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors ( Table 1 and Figure S1 ). The jaw tumors were covered with a thin layer of calcified material (unpublished data), a feature not associated with tumors at other sites or in the other strains of mice. The endemic form of BL initially presents in a randomly unilateral manner in the jaw (see Discussion ). In summary, the constitutive and antigen-stimulated forms of BCR HEL altered tumorigenesis by MYC in distinctive manners. The distinctions involved diverse features of the tumors, including rate of appearance, anatomical presentation and progression, histopathology, and cell-surface phenotype ( Table S1 ). The tumors that arose under the influence of a constitutive BCR resembled human B-CLL, whereas those that developed in the presence of antigen stimulation resembled BL in multiple ways and were similar in two strains of mice with different MYC transgenes. Importantly, our work involves the overexpression of MYC in the context of autoreactive B cells. The overexpression of MYC is the characteristic genetic lesion in BL, such that these mouse models are the most germane to the mechanisms that give rise to BL. To determine the clonality of the various tumors, we used PCR to analyze the V H to DJ H rearrangements of the endogenous IgH genes. The results are summarized in Table 2 and documented in Figure S2 . As expected, the data from spleen cells of normal mice revealed evidence of germ line IgH genes, as well as innumerable rearranged configurations. Similar results were obtained with spleen cells obtained from an MRL mouse with a characteristic lymphoproliferative disease that involves innumerable B cell clones [ 32 ]. In contrast, tumors derived from the various strains of mice with MYC transgenes were composed of relatively few clones of B cells and displayed no evidence of germ line configurations. The E\u03bc- MYC tumors were largely monoclonal (unpublished data), as reported previously [ 20 ]. The E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors contained multiple clones, with the latter slightly more complex than the former (20\u201340 discrete clones for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors, and 10\u201315 clones for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors). Tumors in both the jaw and other sites of the MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice were also multiclonal, and in any given animal, the patterns of Ig rearrangement were similar in tumors from all sites, suggesting that the same group of neoplastic clones gave rise to all of the tumors in the animal (unpublished data). The same conservation of clonal patterns among different organ sites was observed for tumors derived from the other genotypes (E\u03bc- MYC , E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL , and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL). The Clonality of Tumors We conclude that tumors of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL , E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL and MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice arose from a limited number of B cell clones. The multiclonality of the tumors sets them apart from their ostensible human counterparts, which are typically monoclonal [ 31 ]. We attribute this clonal dominance to selection of clones in which even further tumorigenic events have occurred (see Discussion ). We wanted to explore the specific contribution of antigen-dependent signaling to lymphoid transformation in the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. As a first approach, we asked whether the exogenous antigen (HEL) could alter phenotypically normal MMTV-tTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL cells to resemble the tumor cells of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL and MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice. Cells were taken from 4\u20136-wk-old MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL mice that had been fed doxycycline-containing food since birth in order to suppress expression of the MYC transgene ( Figure S3 ). The donor animals appeared clinically normal, and had normal numbers of cells in their lymph nodes and spleen (unpublished data). The donor cells were tracked throughout the experiment by flow cytometric analysis for a B cell marker (B220) and the BCR HEL . Donor cells were transferred to either C57/BL6 mice or age and sex matched mice carrying only the transgene for sHEL. The recipient mice were not treated with doxycycline to allow activation of the MYC transgene in the donor cells. In the absence of sHEL, the number of donor cells detectable in recipient mice did not change ( Figure 4 A) and the mice remained healthy. In contrast, the number of donor cells in sHEL recipients rose continuously over time ( Figure 4 A) until the mice developed overt tumors, 8\u201312 d after receiving the transplanted cells, and eventually died within 28\u201330 d. (A and B) Primary transplants. Spleen and lymph node cells were harvested from an MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL mouse at 4 wk of age. Cells from spleen and lymph nodes were pooled at a 1:1 ratio, and 10 6 cells were introduced into either syngeneic wild-type mice (empty circles) or sHEL transgenic mice (filled circles) by intravenous injection. Cohorts of mice were either kept on regular food (A), or on doxycycline-containing food (B). Tissues were collected at indicated time points from spleens and analyzed for total number of cells. Samples taken from wild-type mice were analyzed at the same times (empty squares). (C and D) Secondary transplants. Cells were collected from tumors of spleens and lymph nodes represented in (A), 16 d after their initiation by transplantation. Cells from spleen and lymph nodes were pooled at a 1:1 ratio, and 10 5 cells were introduced into either wild-type recipients (empty circles) or sHEL transgenic mice (filled circles) by intravenous injection. The empty squares represent wild-type, unmanipulated mice that were analyzed in parallel with the experimental groups. Cohorts of mice were either kept on regular food (C), or on doxycycline-containing food (D). Cells were collected from spleens at the indicated times after the transplantation and analyzed as in (A and B). (E and F) BCLs regress after MYC overexpression is extinguished. (E) A cohort of mice similar to those described in (A) was allowed to develop externally visible lymphadenopathy. 16 d later, those mice were switched to a doxycycline-containing diet. The empty circles represent wild-type recipient mice that received transplants of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL cells, the filled circles represent sHEL transgenic mice that received transplants of those cells, the empty squares represent wild-type, unmanipulated mice that were analyzed in these experiments in parallel with the experimental mice. Cells were collected from spleens at the indicated times after the transplantation and analyzed as in (A and B). (F) MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice were allowed to develop tumors spontaneously, as a result of transgene function. Approximately 40 d later, mice with externally apparent lymphadenopathy were given doxycycline containing food (day 0 in figure). Cells were collected from lymph nodes at the indicated times after exposure of the mice to doxycycline and analyzed as in (A and B). The empty circles represent MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL mice that were never exposed to docycycline, the filled circles represent MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL mice that were given doxycycline-containing food after they developed externally apparent lymphadenopathy, the empty squares represent wild-type, unmanipulated mice that were analyzed in parallel with the experimental mice. In order to test the durability of the requirement for antigen, we harvested tumor cells that had arisen after the initial transplantation of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL cells into sHEL mice and introduced these into either wild-type or a second set of sHEL mice that were not treated with doxycycline. Donor cells again amplified rapidly in the sHEL mice, but not in wild-type recipients ( Figure 4 C). Tumors resulted in death of the recipient mice within 12\u201316 d, a latency appreciably shorter than that observed after the preceding transplantation (28\u201330 d). The flow cytometric profile of the donor cells changed after their encounter with antigen. The donor cells expressed B220, BCR HEL , CD19, CD21, and CD23, but did not express CD69 or B7\u20132 on their surface. The cells that resulted from the expansion following antigenic stimulation in vivo showed a loss of CD23 expression and high levels of CD69 and B7\u20132 expression (unpublished data). The same phenotype was observed with the cells that had expanded following the second transplantation into sHEL recipient mice. This phenotype is typical of antigen-activated B cells. In addition, it is similar to what we initially observed in the cells from tumors that arose in the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice and, thus, also resembles the phenotype of BL ( Table 1 ). We conclude that the appearance and expansion of HEL-specific, BL-like tumor cells in the recipient mice were dependent on stimulation by the cognate antigen. In contrast to the preceding findings, tumor cells obtained from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice or MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice would grow into lethal tumors when transplanted into recipient mice in the absence of HEL antigen ( Figure 4 A, 4 C, and 4F). We postulated that this seeming independence of antigen was due to the intrinsic production of antigen by the tumor cells themselves, as would be expected from the genotype of the cells. That proved to be the case. We were able to detect HEL transcripts and HEL protein in cells obtained from either a primary E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor or an MMTV-TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor, but not in cells obtained from either E\u03bc- MYC or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors (unpublished data). Similarly, we found HEL protein in tumors that arose following transplantation of cells from a primary E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor. We conclude that the murine BL cells are in fact antigen-dependent, but can be sustained by either autocrine or paracrine stimulus. To further test the role of antigen stimulation in the genesis of the B-CLL\u2013 and BL-like tumors, we disrupted the molecular machinery that generates and transmits signals from the BCR. By transduction of suitable interfering RNAs into established tumor cells, we were able to suppress the expression of the Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 signaling chains of the BCR. We have previously shown that these shRNA sequences targeting Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 lead to substantial reduction in the levels of Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 protein in K46\u03bc B cells, respectively [ 33 ]. We have observed that shRNAs directed at either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 individually caused a decrease in the levels of surface IgM in transduced B cells. Importantly, the expression of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 on the cell surface modulates the surface expression of IgH and IgL, the antigen-specific components of the BCR. The vector used for transduction was a lentivirus that has been previously described [ 34 ]. The viruses tested in vitro and in vivo were the parental vector encoding either GFP (pLL3.7) or Thy1.1 (pLL3.77) as a reporter gene, and variants encoding both a reporter gene and shRNAs for either Ig\u03b1, Ig\u03b2, or firefly luciferase, the last as a negative control. Transduction was performed with tumor cells isolated from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice. The rates of transduction varied between 5%\u201350% of the tumor cells ( Figure 5 A). The cells were then maintained in culture and evaluated on a daily basis for reporter gene expression. (A) Cell lines were generated from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors and designated as DBL114, or from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors and designated TBL-1. These cell lines uniformly express B220 and IgM on their surface. To determine whether the shRNA sequences targeting Ig\u03b1 were able to knock down their target protein, we measured the levels of IgM expressed on the surface of DBL-114 cells that were transduced with lentiviral constructs that encode a reporter gene ( GFP ). The expression of IgM on the surface is co-modulated with Ig\u03b1 expression, hence the loss of Ig\u03b1 should reduce the levels of surface IgM. The panels represent the flow cytometric profile of the DBL-114 cells that had been transduced with the parental virus (pLL3.7), or a variant that encodes an shRNA specific for firefly luciferase, as a negative control, or two variants of pLL3.7 that encode different shRNAs specific for Ig\u03b1. The GFP-positive cells in the panels that contained shRNAs specific for Ig\u03b1 showed a loss of surface IgM expression. This is not the case for the GFP-negative fraction of the same cell populations. Similar results were obtained in TBL-1 cells (unpublished data). (B) The shRNA-mediated knock-down of Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 in cells obtained from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors confers a competitive disadvantage on those cells in vitro, compared to their nontransduced counterparts. Single-cell suspensions were generated from the respective tumors, and used for lentiviral transductions. The cells were maintained in cultured and assayed for GFP expression, by flow cytometry every 24 h. The data for the GFP+ fraction in the population of cells harboring a lentivirus encoding and shRNA was divided by the fraction of GFP+ cells in the population of cells that was transduced with the parental vector, in order to standardize the values and examine the rates of change from the starting level of GFP+ cells, as previously reported [ 104 ]. The cells that were transduced with lentiviruses encoding shRNAs specific for either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 exhibited a significant competitive disadvantage when compared to the cells harboring lentiviruses encoding shRNAs specific for firefly luciferase. All wells were set up in triplicates. The graphs represent data from one experiment, representative of eight independent experiments. (C) In vivo validation of the effects of Ig\u03b1-specific shRNAs on the maintenance of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors. Cells were obtained from E\u03bc-MYC/BCR HEL tumors, and transduced in vitro with pLL3.77-sh.luciferase (uses thy1.1 as a reporter gene) or pLL3.7-sh.Ig\u03b1.1 (uses GFP as a reporter gene). The different cell populations were then mixed in order to generate mixtures of cells that contained an approximately equal fraction of cells that harbored the control lentivirus (pLL3.77.sh.luciferase) and the experimental lentivirus (pLL3.7.sh.Ig\u03b1). The mixtures of cells were transplanted into cohorts of Rag-1 \u2013/\u2013 mice. The mice were observed daily until they exhibited externally evident signs of lymphoma, and the organs were harvested. The graphs represent the fraction of cells in the tumorous lymph nodes that retained expression of either thy1.1 (for the control lentivirus), or GFP (for the Ig\u03b1-specific lentivirus. These results confirm the requirement for Ig\u03b1 expression in the maintenance of the murine BCLs. We observed that for both E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, the percentage of cells transduced with either the parental lentivirus, or the variant that encoded shRNA specific to firefly luciferase, did not change appreciably during a 14 day period ( Figure 5 B). In contrast, each of the cultures that was transduced with a lentiviral variant that encoded shRNAs specific to either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 displayed a significant decrease in the frequency of the cells expressing the reporter gene ( Figure 5 B). The same pattern was observed with two independent shRNAs for each of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2. This in vitro competition assay suggested that loss of signaling from the BCR placed the tumor cells at a significant disadvantage when compared to their counterparts that had retained normal signaling from the BCR. In addition, these results demonstrate that the signaling components of the BCR are required for tumors that depend on autogenous signaling by the BCR-derived signals as well as for those that rely on the cognate-antigen\u2013induced BCR signals. To verify these observations in vivo, we isolated tumor cells from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice, and transduced them as described above. We then transplanted the transduced tumor cells into Rag-1 \u2013/\u2013 mice, to evaluate tumor fitness in the absence of any T cell responses to the reporter genes. In this instance, we mixed tumor cells that had been transduced with pLL3.77 (providing thy1.1 as a reporter) encoding an shRNA to firefly luciferase with tumor cells transduced with pLL3.7 (providing GFP as a reporter) encoding shRNAs specific to either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2. This would provide internal controls for each of the mice we transplanted in the cohort. We euthanized the mice 21 days after transplantation, when they developed external signs associated with lymphoma (scruffy fur, hunched posture, lymphadenopathy, dehydration, labored breathing, and an ascending hind limb paralysis). The lymph nodes and spleens were collected and used to generate single-cell suspensions. The cells were then stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. Tumor cells transduced with either pLL3.7-sh.Ig\u03b1 or pLL3.7-shIg\u03b2 failed to expand in vivo ( Figure 5 C), mirroring the results obtained in vitro. In contrast, the nontransduced cells, or the cells transduced with pLL3.77-sh.Luc, expanded in vivo and gave rise to the resulting malignancies. In addition, the genetic disruption of Syk, a key membrane-proximal element of the BCR signal, also conferred a significant competitive disadvantage to established BCL cells in a manner analogous to what we present here with Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 (RMY and YR, unpublished results). These results show that for both tumor types, the acute loss of the signaling components of the BCR complex resulted in a severe competitive disadvantage in vivo, suggesting that these two types of tumors are dependent upon continuous signaling from the BCR. The apparent contribution of BCR signaling to the development of murine lymphomas prompted us to explore the effect of immunosuppressants on the various mouse models. We used cyclosporin A, FK506, and rapamycin to treat well advanced tumors that had been initiated by transplantation. We compared the effects of these agents to that of cyclophosphamide, an agent commonly used to treat human BL [ 35 ]. We transplanted 10 6 cells obtained from tumor-bearing spleen or lymph nodes into cohorts of 4\u201310 mice. The recipient mice were held for observation until they developed externally obvious lymphadenopathy (approximately 100 d for the E\u03bc- MYC tumors, 58 d for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors, 21 d for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, and 14 d for the MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors). The tumor bearing and control wild-type mice were then treated daily for 7 d with intravenous injections of the various drugs. Mice were either euthanized 24 h after the last injection of drug, or held indefinitely to ascertain duration of survival. The analysis of tumor burden was performed with cells obtained from lymph nodes and spleens. The E\u03bc- MYC tumors did not respond to any of the immunosuppressive drugs we tested ( Figure 6 A and 6 E). Disease progressed at the same rate in treated and untreated mice. Histological examination of the affected organs also revealed no evidence of therapeutic response (unpublished data). In contrast, the transplanted E\u03bc- MYC tumors showed a strong response to cyclophosphamide, as previously described [ 36 ]. Treatment with cyclophosphamide elicited tumor regression in all animals, but also caused a more general cytotoxicity, manifested as a reduction in T cells, myeloid cells, and nontransgenic B cells (unpublished data). Similar toxicity from cyclophosphamide was also observed in wild-type mice. Tumor cells were harvested from lymph nodes and spleens and transplanted as described in Methods. The recipient mice were held until tumors became clinically apparent. Tumor recipient (open bars) and wild type (filled bars) mice then received daily injections of the indicated drugs for 7 d of either cyclosporine A (csa), FK506, rapamycin (rap), or cyclophosphamide (cyph). For (A\u2013H), the mice were euthanized 24 h after the last injection of drug, and lymph nodes were harvested for analysis of either total number of cells (A\u2013D) (expressed in single units representing 10 6 cells each) or surface markers of donor cells (E\u2013H). For (I), the mice were observed over a span of 100 da and deaths recorded, as shown. (A and E) E\u03bc- MYC tumors. (B and F) E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors. (C and G) E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. (D and H) MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. (I) Survival of animals bearing E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. The statistical significance of the differences observed in the kinetics of mortality between the tumor-bearing mice that were either untreated, or treated transiently with cyclophosphamide is 0.01. The statistical significance of the difference in the mortality curves observed between those two groups and the tumor-bearing mice treated with either of the three immunosuppressant drugs is p < 0.001. The tumors derived from the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice responded to cyclophosphamide and cyclosporin, but not to either FK506 or rapamycin ( Figure 6 B and 6 F). In contrast, the tumors from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice, as well as tumors from the jaws of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice, responded to both cyclophosphamide and all three of the immunosuppressants tested ( Figure 6 C, 6 D, 6 G, 6 H). The different sensitivities of the tumors derived from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice and those derived from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL or MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice suggests that the constitutive and cognate-antigen\u2013derived BCR signals may be qualitatively distinct. Remissions of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors persisted for at least 5 mo, following a 7-d course of treatment with immunosuppressants ( Figure 6 I and unpublished data). In contrast, the animals treated with cyclophosphamide entered a brief remission, but still died more rapidly than did untreated, tumor-bearing mice ( Figure 6 I and unpublished data), apparently consequent to the toxicity described above. In summary, the response of the various model tumors varied consistently with the genotypes of the mice. B cell tumors that arose from the combined effects of MYC and antigen stimulus responded uniformly to three distinctive immunosuppressants, whereas only one of the three agents was effective against tumors elicited by MYC and a constitutive BCR (For data demonstrating the post-GC nature of antigen-stimulated tumors, see Figure S4 ). Since the E\u03bc- MYC tumors do not express BCR on their surface, they were presumably devoid of any apparent stimulus from the receptor, and were resistant to all the immunosuppressants tested. These results are in accord with two of our hypotheses: that tumorigenesis can be influenced by signals from the BCR, and that the signals generated by constitutive receptor may differ from those arising from an antigen-stimulated receptor (see Discussion ). We also explored whether the murine BL-like tumors were dependent on the continuous overexpression of MYC . To test this issue on established tumors, we allowed MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice to develop tumors in the absence of doxycycline. The mice were then given doxycycline-containing food in order to suppress the expression of the MYC transgene ( Figure S3 ). The tumors quickly regressed ( Figure 4 F and unpublished data). The establishment and maintenance of the BL-like tumors that arose following transplantation of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL cells into sHEL mice was also dependent upon the overexpression of MYC . This conclusion was based on several findings. First, the transplantation of cells MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL could not give rise to tumors if the transplanted cells were prohibited from expressing their MYC transgene by administration of doxycycline to the recipient mice ( Figure 4 B). Second, tumor cells that had arisen from the transplantation of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL cells could not be further passaged in the absence of overexpressed MYC ( Figure 4 D). And third, tumors that arose following transplantation of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL cells would regress once expression of the MYC transgene was extinguished with doxycycline ( Figure 4 E). We conclude that the development and maintenance of the BL-like tumors requires continuous stimulation by MYC . Previous observations have raised the possibility that expression of a BCR can contribute to the genesis of lymphomas (reviewed in [ 3 ]). We have used transgenic mice to explore this possibility. Our results demonstrated that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated states of the BCR can cooperate with overexpression of the proto-oncogene MYC in the genesis of BCLs. The types of B cell tumors produced in the two instances differ appreciably, with the former resembling a subset of human B-CLL, the latter resembling human BL. This work provides a direct demonstration that signaling from the BCR can contribute to lymphomagenesis. The mouse models described here should be useful for further study of tumorigenesis in the B cell lineage, and for preclinical testing of therapeutics. Previous work has shown that overexpression of MYC in the B cell lineage can give rise to lymphomas in mice (reviewed in [ 20 ]). We have now found that the BCR can both accelerate tumorigenesis by MYC and alter the nature of the resulting tumors. The acceleration is greater when the BCR is stimulated by antigen than when it is not, and the resulting tumors differ in their clinical behavior, anatomical presentation, histopathology, and surface phenotype. In addition, the two sorts of tumors respond differently to a trio of immunosuppressants, each of which can probably act on distinct signaling pathways activated by antigen receptor [ 37 \u2013 39 ]. We attribute these differences among the tumors to the fact that the BCR can apparently generate at least two forms of signals\u2014one produced by the binding of the cognate antigen, the other an \u201cautogenous\u201d signal generated by the ostensibly unstimulated receptor [ 5 ]. Our results sustain the view that the two forms of signals are different, suggest that this difference affects the nature of the tumors produced by MYC , and provide direct evidence that each of the two forms of signaling can contribute to lymphomagenesis\u2014a notion that has heretofore been based solely on correlative data. The biochemical nature of the constitutive signal derived from the BCR remains to be determined. Our genetic studies involving the disruption of Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 in established tumors suggests that both of those signaling chains are required for constitutive and cognate antigen triggered signals. The results we obtained showing differential sensitivity to cyclosporine A, FK506, and rapamycin in murine BL- and B-CLL\u2013like tumors suggest that the two signals derived from the BCR involve the activation of different transduction pathways. The tumor models we have developed may also enable us to dissect the molecular basis of constitutive BCR signaling in the context of B cell development and neoplasia. Signaling by the antigen-stimulated BCR has been studied in great depth [ 40 ]. It is known to mediate B cell proliferation and could contribute to tumorigenesis if sustained inappropriately. We have shown here that antigen-stimulated signaling from the BCR can cooperate with the oncogene MYC to produce tumors that remain dependent upon antigen and that resemble BL of humans. Yan et al. recently reported that autoantigenic drive may contribute to the genesis of a tumor resembling CD5+ B-CLL in mice expressing a transgene of TCL1 [ 41 ]. These authors suggested a link to BCR signaling, based on their analysis of endogenous BCR usage. The presence of repeated patterns may be suggestive of conserved antigenic stimulation, but is not definitive. Whether a common specificity is a foreign or self-antigen is also unclear from the pattern of BCR usage. A second tcl-1 transgenic mouse presented with a tumor phenotype of large BCLs (BL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)). Those tumors were all CD5 \u2013 , suggesting an inherent difference the two transgenic mouse strains that overexpress tcl-1 in both mature B-cell compartments [ 42 ]. A Bcl-6 transgenic mouse has also been reported to yield DLBCL-like tumors in mice that presented with a post-GC phenotype [ 43 ]. Importantly, our work involves the overexpression of MYC in the context of autoreactive B cells. The overexpression of MYC is the characteristic genetic lesion in BL, such that these mouse models are the most germane to the mechanisms that give rise to BL. Two recent reports have also implicated autoantigenic stimulation of B cells either in the genesis of a lymphoma that occurs in mice expressing a transgene for the TCL1 gene, and that resembles human B-CLL [ 41 ], or in the instance of DLBCL-like tumors that arose in Bcl-6 transgenic mice [ 43 ]. Subsequent analysis of the DLBCL-like tumors that develop in the Bcl-6 transgenic mice demonstrated a need for AID expression for the genesis of those post-GC B cell malignancies [ 44 ]. Our work provides a direct demonstration that autoantigenic stimulation can contribute to lymphomagenesis. The comparison of the constitutive and cognate-antigen\u2013stimulated BCR is unique in the context of tumorigenesis models. In fact, the models we have developed represent the closest genotypic and phenotypic approximation to human BL. In contrast, the autogenous form of BCR signaling remains something of an enigma [ 5 ]. Both the origin and the effectors of this signal are less understood than antigen-dependent BCR signals, but the signal appears to be important in B cell development and survival of mature, na\u00efve B cells, and is implicated in homeostatic control over the size of the lymphoid compartment between immune responses [ 4 , 6 ]. It is not clear if the same signal is responsible for these several functions; alternatively, the responsible signals might differ from one another either quantitatively or qualitatively. In the present work, an autogenous signal from a mature BCR cooperated with MYC to produce a lymphoma that was distinctively different from the tumor produced when the same BCR was subjected to sustained antigenic stimulus. This finding sustains the view that autogenous and antigen-stimulated signaling from the BCR must differ in some way. In a previous report, introduction of a transgene for the human IgH chain into E\u03bc- MYC mice delayed the onset of tumors and sometimes changed the involved cells to the myeloid and T cell lineages [ 45 ]. Using a different strain of E\u03bc- MYC mice [ 20 ], we found that a murine BCR accelerated tumorigenesis and did not change the affected lineage. In addition, we confirmed our observations with a second strain of mice that overexpress MYC in the B cell lineage (MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC ). We suggest that the different outcomes in the present and previous work may be due to the use of substantially different transgenes, but we have not explored the matter further, because it appears not to bear on our conclusions. The tumors that arose in the MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice displayed sustained dependence upon both the activity of the MYC transgene and the stimulus to tumor cells provided by a cognate autoantigen. These findings are in accord with recent reports of diverse mouse models in which the survival and growth of tumors remain dependent upon the genetic lesion that initiated tumorigenesis (for examples, see [ 46 \u2013 49 ]; see [ 50 ] for a review). In the present instance, we have demonstrated dependence upon two distinctive tumorigenic influences. MYC initiates and is also involved in some level in the maintenance of tumors, whereas antigenic stimulus may sustain cellular proliferation, promote cell survival, or affect cellular differentiation. Moreover, MYC can facilitate the effect of autoantigen by breaking immune tolerance in B cells ([ 51 ], and see below). The future design of targeted therapies for cancer will probably benefit from the elucidation of such interactions among the steps in tumor progression. We initiated the current work in order to explore the role of antigenic stimulus in the genesis of lymphomas. We used a model in which the bulk of B cells are programmed to respond to a single antigen (HEL), which in turn is also provided as a neo-autoantigen by a transgene. As originally described, mice bearing these two transgenes are anergic for the transgenic autoantigen [ 25 ]. So the discovery that the HEL autoantigen could cooperate in tumorigenesis seemed counterintuitive. As reported by us elsewhere [ 51 ], however, overexpression of transgenic MYC apparently reversibly breaks tolerance in these mice and allows B cells to respond to the HEL autoantigen. Accordingly, the tumors are composed of mature, activated B cells with high-affinity receptors for HEL. We attribute these findings to the fact that in both B and T cells, the abundant expression of MYC can serve as a surrogate for cytokines [ 51 \u2013 55 ]. It has been shown previously that cytokines can override B cell tolerance [ 56 ]. Whatever its mechanism, the breach of tolerance by MYC in the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL transgenic mice permits a strong autoantigenic drive of B cell proliferation, and this in turn apparently modifies tumorigenesis by the oncogene. There is circumstantial evidence that associates broken tolerance with lymphomagenesis in humans. First, the incidence of lymphoid neoplasms is increased in various autoimmune syndromes [ 57 ]. For example, individuals with Sj\u00f6rgen syndrome display a nearly 50-fold increase in the incidence of either diffuse large BCL or follicular BCL [ 58 ]. Second, individuals with BL and other forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) frequently have high levels of autoantibodies in their sera [ 59 \u2013 64 ] and develop autoimmune hemolytic anemia [ 65 , 66 ]. In addition, the sequences of the Ig receptors expressed by cells of NHL have been shown to contain mutations that may have arisen during a GC reaction [ 67 ]. These mutations may alter receptor specificity, rendering the cells autoreactive. A history of hypermutation in these tumors is also manifested by a high frequency of mutations in alleles of MYC that have not been translocated [ 68 ]. Given the role of MYC in the mouse tumors described here, it might be profitable to explore the effect of other oncogenes on immune tolerance. We have described two mouse models that develop a lymphoma with a close resemblance to human BL. The similarities include anatomical presentation and other clinical manifestations, histological appearance, and immunophenotype. A particularly striking finding was the unilateral occurrence of jaw tumors in the MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice. This manifestation is characteristic of African BL [ 69 ], but remains unexplained in both the human and murine setting. In addition, we have shown that the BL-like tumors are composed of cells that have undergone a GC reaction. The evidence supporting this notion includes: expression of cell surface markers that are consistent with a post-GC cell; the presence of class switched immunoglobulins specific to the model autoantigen, HEL; the presence of point mutations in the BCR that are likely the result of somatic mutation that occurs during the GC reaction; and the detection of high levels of mRNA for two GC-associated genes, Bcl-6 and AID . This is the most complete set of parameters yet used to define a mouse model of BL. Several previous reports have described experimental approaches that might have produced mouse models of BL [ 20 , 47 , 70 \u2013 73 ]. Only one of these attempts, however, produced a tumor with substantive resemblances to BL [ 72 ]. That model used the control of the Ig\u03bb-MYC promoter and enhancer elements to express a mutant form of MYC that is found in human NHL. No provision was made for deliberate antigenic stimulation of B cells, but the tumor cells did show evidence of immune selection, in the form of point mutations in the Ig loci. In addition, we have demonstrated the GC origin of the BL tumors in our mouse model, whereas this was not the case for the lymphomas that developed in Ig\u03bb-MYC mice [ 72 ]. These findings prompted the authors to invoke stimulus by an unidentified antigen in the genesis of the murine tumors. Our work reconstructs such stimulus with a clonal BCR and cognate neo-autoantigen, and demonstrates a contribution of the stimulus to tumorigenesis. BL appears in two major forms: endemic and sporadic. The endemic form is found mainly in Africa and is characterized by infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [ 74 , 75 ]. In contrast, an association with EBV infection is found in only about 20% of sporadic BL, but chronic infection with another, as yet unidentified microbe might well figure in the remainder. Viral infection plays no role in the mouse models of BL described here. We presume that the need for such infection has been circumvented by overexpression of the MYC transgene, which serves as a surrogate for the translocations that are a hallmark of human BL and are thought to occur subsequent to initiation of tumorigenesis by EBV or another agent [ 76 ]. With few exceptions, the tumor cells of BL have been described as monoclonal [ 77 \u2013 80 ]. In contrast, the tumor cells in the two animal models for BL described here are multiclonal. How might we explain this distinction? The human tumor presumably arises from a series of rare events, each amplified by clonal selection ([ 81 ]; reviewed in [ 82 ]). The cumulative rarity in this sequence of events dictates that the eventual tumor is likely to be the product of a single clonal lineage. In contrast, the experimental model described here provides at least two potentially tumorigenic influences that are ubiquitous in the B cell lineage of the transgenic animals: overexpression of MYC and stimulus by an autoantigen. Thus, a vast population of cells may be predisposed to tumor progression. Indeed, it is remarkable that the resulting tumors are composed of only a finite number of clones, suggesting the occurrence of clonal selection for tumorigenic events beyond those imposed experimentally. The results contrast sharply with the innumerable clones that proliferate to produce a relatively indolent disease in MRL mice, a proliferation that is itself driven by autoimmunity . A variety of circumstantial evidence has implicated antigenic stimulus in the genesis of BL [ 83 ]. First, chronic infection with malaria in Africa is associated with an increased incidence of BL and accelerated progression of the disease [ 84 , 85 ]. Second, the possibility of sustained antigenic stimulus is raised by the mature, activated immunophenotype characteristic of BL cells [ 86 ]. Third, the sequences for the immunoglobulin molecules in many NHL, including BL, bear somatic mutations of the sort that normally arise during the process of affinity maturation [ 8 \u2013 14 ] If antigenic stimulation does play a role in the genesis of human BL, it would be in cooperation with MYC , whose activation by chromosomal translocation is a general feature of the tumor [ 87 ]. Our results with mouse models suggest that the hypothetical role of antigenic stimulus in the pathogenesis of BL should be pursued further. We have shown that antigenic stimulus can apparently contribute to the establishment and maintenance of B-cell lymphomas in mice. The tumors that arose in the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL and MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice expressed a neo-autoantigen (sHEL), which provided an autoimmune stimulus to the tumor cells. This in turn allowed the tumors to become self-sufficient and retain continuous cognate antigen stimulation upon transplantation. This notion was further supported by experiments in which the signaling components of the BCR were genetically disrupted with shRNAs. The requirement for antigen in turn suggested that the tumors might respond to pharmacological interruption of signaling from the BCR. This proved to be the case: treatment with cyclosporin, FK506, or rapamycin elicited prolonged remissions. These results conform to the view that antigen-induced signaling from the BCR was involved in the genesis of the tumors. We recognize, however, that none of the immunosuppressants acts exclusively on signaling from the BCR and, as a result, each might inhibit tumors by a different means [ 88 \u2013 90 ]. For example, it has been reported that rapamycin can inhibit angiogenesis in certain solid tumors [ 91 ], whereas other immunosuppressants failed to demonstrate this inhibition. In contrast, rapamycin, cyclosporin, and FK506 all inhibit signaling from the BCR [ 92 \u2013 94 ], and all three elicited remissions of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL and MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. Moreover, this uniform effect of the three immunosuppressants did not extend to tumors in which antigen stimulus ostensibly played no role (E\u03bc- MYC and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL ). We conclude that the therapeutic effects of immunosuppressants reported here for the BL model probably reflect the role of antigen-induced signaling from the BCR in the pathogenesis of the tumor. Tactics that interrupt expression of signaling from the BCR might also be useful in the treatment of human lymphomas that express the receptor. Mice carrying the E\u03bc- MYC transgene have been described previously [ 20 ] and were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. These mice express MYC in a B cell\u2013specific manner, beginning at the Pre/Pro-B cell stage. The TRE- MYC and MMTV-rtTA mice have been described previously [ 21 , 23 ]. We crossbred these strains to combine the two transgenes in a single strain (MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC), in which the B cell\u2013specific expression of the MYC transgene can be repressed by the administration of tetracycline or doxycycline. We also used both BCR HEL mice, which express a pre-rearranged murine BCR from the endogenous immunoglobulin promoter, and sHEL mice, which ubiquitously express a transgene for the soluble form of soluble HEL under the control of the metallothionein promoter. These two strains have been described previously [ 25 ] and were generously provided by Jason Cyster (University of California, San Francisco). We also used a strain of mice in which a previously rearranged IgH VDJ sequence was knocked into the IgH locu [ 95 ]. When used in combination with another strain, encoding an IgL transgene (Lt-tg), those bigenic mice generate about 30% HEL-specific B cells, as previously describe[ 95 ]5]. Those two strains of mice were kindly provided by Jason Cyster, at UCSF. All transgenic mouse lines were maintained on a C57/BL6 background, and were genotyped by PCR as previously described [ 20 , 25 , 96 ]. All animals were maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the Committee on Animal Research at the University of California, San Francisco, and the National Research Council. Adoptive transfers of cells and transplantation of tumors were done by injecting 10 6 cells intravenously (unless otherwise indicated) into syngeneic (C57/BL6) females ranging in age from 4\u20136 wk. For the experiments that involved tumor cells obtained from MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, the recipient mice were sublethally irradiated (450 rads) in order to overcome some remaining allogeneic differences between the two strains. The emergence of tumors was followed in three ways: (i) physical examination of living animals and necropsy of deceased animals, particularly to detect enlargement of lymphoid organs and viscera; (ii) counting the total number of cells in organs; and (iii) the specific enumeration of B cells carrying cell-surface receptor for the antigen HEL. Three pairs of lymph nodes were collected each time (two inguinal, two axillary, and two brachial lymph nodes). These lymph nodes were pooled and processed into single-cell suspensions. Spleens and thymii were also collected and used to generate single-cell suspensions. Each spleen or thymus was individually ground on a 60-\u03bcm wire mesh screen (Sigma). The red blood cells were lysed in TAC buffer (0.017 M Tris, pH 7.65, and 0.135 M NH 4 Cl), as previously described [ 95 ], and the resulting pellets were resuspended in complete lymphocyte media, which consists of RPMI1640 + 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, supplemented with L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, nonessential amino acids, 2 mM HEPES, 2mM sodium pyruvate, and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoeathanol (all obtained from Invitrogen). Single-cell suspensions were counted with a Coulter counter (Coulter Diagnostics). The percentage of viable cells was determined by uptake of 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD) and flow cytometry. The values for total cell numbers were used to derive the number of viable cells by multiplying percentage of viable cells (obtained from the 7AAD analysis) by the total number of cells (obtained from the Coulter counter analysis), and dividing by 100. These measurements were compared with microscopic counting of trypan-blue excluding cells in a hemocytometer. To determine the number of B cells carrying the BCR HEL transgene, single-cell suspensions were stained with antibodies to B220 and IgM a (both obtained from Pharmingen Laboratories), followed by flow cytometric analysis. The number of BCR HEL + B cells was determined by multiplying the percentage of B220+/IgM a + cells (obtained from the FACS analysis) by the number of total viable cells and dividing by 100. These values were compared to stains performed using a pan-specific antibody to IgM (Pharmingen Laboratories). This approach was used to determine the number of BCR HEL expressing cells in all the cases where the mice were on a C57/BL6 background, where the allotype expressed is normally IgM b . For the mice in which the genetic background was mixed (all the experiments that involved the MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC transgenes), the number of BCR HEL -expressing cells was determined by HEL binding. Single-cell suspensions were incubated with HEL (1 mg/ml, obtained from Sigma) in FACS buffer. These cells were washed and incubated with Hy9-biotin, an HEL-specific monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Jason Cyster, UCSF), followed by streptavidin-PE and B220-FITC (both obtained from Pharmingen Laboratories). The surface phenotype of cells present in the lymphoid organs of normal and tumor-bearing mice was analyzed by flow cytometry. Single cell suspensions were prepared from the lymph nodes, spleens, thymus, and bone marrow. The cell suspensions were incubated with 1:50 dilutions of antibodies on ice for 30 min, and were then washed in FACS buffer (1% BSA in PBS + 0.05% sodium azide) and fixed in PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde. Cells were stained with antibodies to one or more of the following markers: B220, Thy1.2, Mac-1, IgM (pan), IgM a , IgM b , IgD (pan) and IgD a , CD4, CD5, CD8, CD19, CD21, CD23, CD25, CD44, CD62L, CD69, CD80, and/or CD86 (all obtained from BD-Pharmingen). Binding of HEL to B cells was assessed by incubating cell suspensions with 1 mg/ml HEL (Sigma) in FACS buffer. The cells were then washed and incubated with Hy9-biotin, followed by Streptavidin-PE (BD-Pharmingen). To determine the clonal composition of the tumors, we adapted a protocol that has been described previously [ 97 ]. Genomic DNA was extracted from 10 6 cells (from either spleen or lymph nodes) using the Quiagen genomic DNA mini-kit (Quiagen), following the manufacturer's specifications. 200 ng of genomic DNA was used for a nested PCR reaction. The first reaction consisted of 5 \u03bcl of 10X Taq buffer (Gibco/Invitrogen), 4 \u03bcl of 50 mM MgCl 2 , 2.5 ng of V H -specific primer, 2.5 ng of J H- specific primer, 2.5 nM dNTPs (Roche Diagnostics) and 2.5 U of Taq polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) and distilled-deionized water to a final volume of 50 \u03bcl. The reactions were placed in a thermal cycler (MJ-Research) and subjected to a PCR cycle as previously described [ 97 ]. A sample of 2 \u03bcl from the first reaction was used as a template for the second reaction of the nested PCR. This reaction was conducted as the first one, except that the primer pairs encoded sequences within the initial set used earlier. The sequences for all the primers used have been previously described [ 96 ]. The PCR reaction products were fractionated in a 2% agarose/TAE gel, stained with ethidium bromide. Some of the PCR products were cloned using a TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen Laboratories), following manufacturer's specifications, then sequenced using the Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems), following manufacturer's specification, at the UCSF General Clinical Research Centers core facility. We used the Reynolds algorithm [ 98 ] and pSICO oligomaker software [ 35 ] in order to design the optimal target shRNA sequences. Those core 19-mer sequences were incorporated into the oligonucleotides designed to contain the stem and loop portions of the shRNA to be cloned into the vector pLL3.7 [ 36 ]. Cloning was performed as previously described [ 36 ]. The specific sequences we used to disrupt expression of murine Ig\u03b1, Ig\u03b2 or the control (firefly luciferase) have been described elsewhere [ 95 ]. All constructs presented here were initially validated for their ability to specifically knock down the expression levels of the protein of interest by transduction of two BCLs that we generated from the mouse models presented here. The two types of B cell lines we generated were derived from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL (DBL: d ouble transgenic B cell lymphoma) and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL (TBL: t riply transgenic B cell lymphoma) primary murine tumors. DBL and TBL cell lines were generated by passive selection from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL primary murine tumors, respectively. Tumor B cell lines were grown in C10 (RPMI, 10% FBS (HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen) 100 units/ml penicillin G and streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 0.55 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen)). The GFP+ fraction of the transduced cell population was used for either Western blotting or flow cytometric analysis of protein expression. To generate infectious viral particles, we used 293FT cells as a packaging system that had been previously described [ 99 ]. 293FT cells were grown in D10 media (DMEM, 10% FBS (HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). 293FT cells grown to 60% confluency in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 5 \u03bcg pLL3.7, 3.3 \u03bcg pMDLg/pRRE, 1.3\u03bcg pRSV-REV, and 1.9\u03bcg pMD.G [ 99 ] overnight using calcium-phosphate methods, as described previously [ 36 ]. Media were replaced with 4.5 ml fresh D10 the following morning. Infections were performed as previously described [ 35 ]. Briefly, supernatants from 293FT cells were harvested 2 d after transfection and replaced with fresh D10. Viral supernatants were passed through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter and brought to a final concentration of 8 \u03bcg/ml polybrene and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. These supernatants were overlayed on 2 \u00d7 10 5 DBL and TBL cells and spun at 2,000 rpm for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C. Following spinfection, viral supernatants were removed and replaced with fresh C10. Infections were repeated the following day (3 d after transfection). For the in vitro assays used to determine whether the disruption of a gene product affected the competitiveness of a tumor cell, we used a mixed of transduced and nontransduced cells. The efficiency of viral transduction of DBL and TBL cell lines was initially evaluated 48 h after the second spin infection. We subsequently tracked infected cells for two weeks post-infection. For analysis, we normalized all infection efficiencies to the 48-h time point, and further normalized each day to the infection rate for the pLL3.7 alone. Groups of six mice were used for each of the experimental protocols. Four mice bearing transplanted tumors, and two age- and sex-matched wild-type mice were treated with the same drug and equal frequency. The transplant-recipient mice were held until tumors became clinically apparent (approximately 100 d for the E\u03bc- MYC tumors, 58 d for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors, 21 d for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, and 14 d for the MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors). The mice then received daily injections of the indicated agents for 7 d. Mice were either euthanized 24 h after the last injection of drug, or held indefinitely to ascertain survival. Lymph nodes, spleens and bone marrows were collected and processed to generate single-cell suspensions. The cells were counted as described above. An aliquot from the cell suspensions was stained with antibodies for B220, Thy 1.2, Mac-1, IgM a , B7\u20132, and CD69, in order to determine the proportion of B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells, as well as the activation status of the HEL-reactive B cells. Treatments were performed with cyclosporin A (Bedford Laboratories) (2 mg/kg/day), FK506 (Prograf, Fujisawa Healthcare) (2 mg/kg/day), rapamycin (Biomol) (2 mg/kg/day), and cyclophosphamide (Bristol-Myers Squibb) (1 mg/kg/day). The therapeutic agents were suspended in PBS, sterilized by filtration through a 0.22\u03bcm membrane, and administered intravenously through the tail vein. Normal and tumor tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4\u03bcm) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Images were acquired with a CCD camera mounted on a phase-contrast microscope. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on spleen cells from a wild-type mouse (orange trace), a tumor-bearing E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mouse (blue trace), or a tumor-bearing E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mouse (pink trace), and cells from a jaw tumor in an MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mouse (green trace). Staining for the indicated surface markers was compared to unstained spleen cells from wild-type mice (filled purple trace). (2.28 MB TIF) Click here for additional data file. Genomic DNA was analyzed for V H to DJ H rearrangements as described in the Methods section. We examined rearrangements of 16 different combinations of four V region genes (lanes numbered 1\u20134, as follows: 1 corresponds to 36\u20136, 2 to 81X, 3 to Q-52, and 4 to J558). These were tested in combination with the four J H genes listed in the figure (J H 1\u20134). The arrows in the lower left corners of the panels indicate the PCR products that resulted from amplification of the germ line configuration. All of the rearranged VDJ H products migrated more slowly in the gel. The data are representative of three different matched pairs of primary and transplanted tumors, for each tumor type. (A) Wild-type spleen. (B) Spleen cells from a 6 month old MRL mouse with lymphoproliferative disease. (C) Spleen tumor from an E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mouse.

Splenic B cells were obtained from said mice, activated in vitro for 3 d with antibodies to IgM and CD40, in the presence or absence of docycycline. Cells were then lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and western blot analysis. The antibody used to detect human MYC , encoded by the transgene was 9E10.

Based on histological appearance and cell-surface markers, we suggested that the tumors arising in E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL and MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice resembled BL (see Results section). To further authenticate the resemblance, we sought evidence that the mouse tumors were derived from post-GC B cells. We used three criteria to define whether the cells derived from the murine BCLs in our models have undergone a GC reaction. First, evidence of immunoglobulin class switching; second, hypermutation in the nucleic acid sequence encoding for the BCR hypervariable regions expressed by the tumor cells; and third, expression of genes associated with the GC process. We could not explore class switching and somatic mutation with the mouse strains used to this point, because the BCR HEL transgene was not controlled by the internal elements of the IgH locus, was configured to generate mature IgM and IgD isotypes, and could not undergo further class switching. Instead, we obtained two additional genetically modified mouse strains that would enable this analysis with a defined antigenic specificity: one in which the hypervariable region for the IgH specific to HEL had been recombined into the corresponding site of the IgH locus, named VDJki [ 95 ], and another that harbored a transgene encoding the IgL that would normally pair with the corresponding IgH in the HEL-specific hybridoma from which the hypervariable region was cloned, named Lt-tg [ 95 ]. Those two alleles have previously been shown to give rise to HEL-specific B cells that can undergo a GC reaction, as determined by their ability to produce HEL-specific antibodies that had class-switched [ 95 ]. The key advantage of using the VDJki/Lt-tg mice to generate HEL-specific B-cells over BCR HEL transgenic mice is the ability of the former to undergo somatic mutations and class switching in a GC-dependent manner, since the HEL-specific components were integrated into the normal locus [ 95 ]. In order to facilitate this strategy, we created a strain of mice (E\u03bc- MYC /VDJki/Lt-tg/sHEL) that incorporated the knock-in allele for generating HEL-specific B cells, and used this strain to examine whether the cells that composed the resulting BL-like tumors had been selected in the GC. The mice developed BCLs at about 50\u201364 d after birth, with complete penetrance (unpublished data). The resulting tumors were present in the lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and bone marrow, and also infiltrated other organs, including the liver, lungs, kidney, and central nervous system (unpublished data). The tumor cells were B220+, CD19+, IgM+, CD69+, B7\u20132+, CD21+, CD23-, and PNA+, consistent with a mature, activated, post-GC phenotype, and identical to what we had observed previously with the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice ( Table 1 ). In addition, the tumors that arose from E\u03bc- MYC /VDJki/Lt-tg/sHEL mice displayed the characteristic \u201cstarry sky\u201d histopathogy, and could be readily transplanted into unmanipulated, syngeneic recipient mice (unpublished data). We also tested the dependence of the tumors that arose in E\u03bc- MYC /VDJki/Lt-tg/sHEL mice upon continuous BCR-derived signals. We used the shRNA-mediated knockdown approach to target Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2, as shown in Figure 4 . We observed that the tumors that developed in E\u03bc- MYC /VDJki/Lt-tg/sHEL mice required Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 expression for their maintenance in vitro, suggesting that they depend upon continuous antigenic stimulation (unpublished data). To test whether the cells that compose the tumors obtained from the E\u03bc- MYC /IgH129ki/Lt-tg/sHEL mice had undergone a GC reaction, we examined three criteria: the presence of HEL-specific immunoglobulins in the sera of the tumor-bearing mice that are of different classes (IgM, IgG, and IgA); the presence of point mutations in the VDJ joint sequences of the IgH129ki allele, consistent with somatic mutations that occur in the germinal center during the process of affinity maturation; and the expression of two GC-associated genes, Bcl-6 and activation-induced cytidine deaminase ( AID ). The first difference that we observed between the tumors that developed in E\u03bc- MYC /IgH129ki/Lt-tg/sHEL mice and those from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice was the secretion of additional Ig types (A). In addition to HEL-specific IgM (found also in the tumors expressing the BCR HEL transgene), we also detected HEL-specific IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgA, as expected from the class switching that occurs in the GC reaction. In addition, not all the tumor-bearing mice had all Ig isotypes, suggesting clonal differences among the different tumors. We amplified the VDJ joint sequence from eight tumors obtained from E\u03bc- MYC /IgH129ki/Lt-tg/sHEL mice by PCR-based methods, then cloned the amplified products and sequenced the contents obtained from 120 independent colonies. Every sequence obtained from those tumors contained mutations in the VDJ sequence of the IgH129ki allele. Moreover, we found several clones that contained the identical patterns of mutations (B). By contrast, we noticed one mutation among 20 alleles we sequenced from a normal, healthy IgH129ki mouse, which we attribute to a PCR error. While the class switching and somatic mutation data should suffice to formally prove that the BL-like tumors are composed of post-GC cells, we also sought to determine whether those cells express transcripts of two genes that are normally associated with the GC reaction. Accordingly, we developed assays for real-time, semi-quantitative RT-PCR for Bcl-6 and AID . Bcl-6 is highly expressed in human DLBL, and a loss of function mutation in mice was shown to lead to defective formation of GC [ 100 ]. AID was shown to be critical for the processes of class-switch recombination and somatic mutation that are carried out during a GC reaction [ 101 ]. Our results show that 8/8 tumors expressed high levels of Bcl-6 transcripts, and 5/8 tumors expressed high levels of AID mRNA relative to normal splenic B cells (C). In addition, we were also able to detect high levels of Bcl-6 mRNA in tumors that developed in E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice, although we were not able to detect AID transcripts in those tumors ( n = 10) (C). We did not observe any detectable levels of mRNAs for either AID or Bcl-6 in the tumors that developed in E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice (C). These data allow us to conclude that the MYC -driven, antigen-dependent BCLs in the E\u03bc- MYC /IgH129ki/Lt-tg/sHEL mice were composed of post-GC cells, in accord with their other resemblances to BL. Thus, by diverse measures, the tumors in E\u03bc- MYC /IgH129ki/Lt-tg/sHEL mice provide a reasonable facsimile of BL. In addition, the conclusions obtained from these studies likely extend to our additional mouse models of BL. (A) Analysis of class-switching in HEL-specific BCLs. Groups of eight mice for each genotype described were used for these assays. The sera samples were examined for the presence of HEL-specific immunoglobulins using a solid-phase either bled at 8 wk of age (all of the control groups), or upon presenting of clinical signs of disease (for E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL and VDJIki/Lt-tg/BCR HEL /sHEL mice). ELISA assay. Sera were obtained from groups of eight mice of the specified genotypes and assayed in triplicate by ELISA against HEL, using isotype-specific secondary antibodies. The sera were obtained from wild-type mice (column 1), na\u00efve BCR HEL mice (column 2), BCR HEL that were immunized with HEL emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant 14 d prior to bleeding (column 3), na\u00efve VDJki/Lt-Tg mice (column 4), VDJki/Lt-Tg mice that were immunized with HEL emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant 14 d prior to bleeding (column 5), tumor-bearing E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice (column 6), or tumor-bearing VDJIki/Lt-tg/BCR HEL /sHEL mice (column 7). The results shown here are from one representative experiment of three. (B) Analysis of somatic mutations in the immunoglobulin joint sequence. We PCR-amplified and sequenced the VDJ-joint sequence of the HEL-specific BCR in tumor-bearing mice in order to determine whether GC-associated somatic mutation was evident in BL tumors. Cells were obtained from tumor-bearing E\u03bc- MYC /VDJki/Lt-Tg/sHEL mice and used to obtain genomic DNA. The DNAs were used to perform a PCR reaction with primers surrounding the IgH VDJ joint region used for generating the knock-in mutation. PCR products were cloned into TOPO cloning vectors and sequenced. The bold, underlined letters in the sequence show mutations found in the tumors, as opposed to the sequences obtained from a VDJki/Lt-Tg mouse (20 clones), presented at the bottom of the table. We only detected one point mutation among the 20 clones that we sequenced from normal VDJki/Lt-tg B-cells. (C) Detection of mRNAs encoding Bcl-6 and AID in tumors obtained from E\u03bc- MYC /VDJki/Lt-tg/sHEL transgenic mice. Cells were obtained from either normal VDJki/Lt-tg mice (column 1), tumor-bearing E\u03bc-MYC mice (column 2), or tumor-bearing E\u03bc- MYC /VDJki/Lt-Tg/sHEL mice (columns 3\u201310). All cell suspensions were depleted from their T cells, and used to generate RNA with a Trizol reagent. These RNAs were used to generate cDNAs in vitro with random primers. The resulting cDNAs were then used for real-time, semiquantitative RT-PCR, using SYBR green for fluorescent detection. We used oligonucleotides specific for AID or Bcl-6, as previously reported [ 102 , 103 ]. The values presented were standardized to the levels of two housekeeping genes ( GAPDH and L32 ). The results presented here are from one assay representative of three independent assays. (4.05 MB TIF) Click here for additional data file.

          "The B Cell Antigen Receptor and Overexpression of  [Chunk 0]\n\nA variety of circumstantial evidence from humans has implicated the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in the genesis of B cell lymphomas. We generated mouse models designed to test this possibility directly, and we found that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated state of a clonal BCR affected the rate and outcome of lymphomagenesis initiated by the proto-oncogene MYC. The tumors that arose in the presence of constitutive BCR differed from those initiated by MYC alone and resembled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (B-CLL), whereas those that arose in response to antigen stimulation resembled large B-cell lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma (BL). We linked the genesis of the BL-like tumors to antigen stimulus in three ways. First, in reconstruction experiments, stimulation of B cells by an autoantigen in the presence of overexpressed MYC gave rise to BL-like tumors that were, in turn, dependent on both MYC and the antigen for survival and proliferation. Second, genetic disruption of the pathway that mediates signaling from the BCR promptly killed cells of the BL-like tumors as well as the tumors resembling B-CLL. And third, growth of the murine BL could be inhibited by any of three distinctive immunosuppressants, in accord with the dependence of the tumors on antigen-induced signaling. Together, our results provide direct evidence that antigenic stimulation can participate in lymphomagenesis, point to a potential role for the constitutive BCR as well, and sustain the view that the constitutive BCR gives rise to signals different from those elicited by antigen. The mouse models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas, and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics.\n\nThe B Cell Antigen Receptor and Overexpression of \n\nA variety of circumstantial evidence from humans has implicated the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in the genesis of B cell lymphomas.

There are at least 15 different types of B cell lymphomas (BCLs), differing in clinical behavior, biological phenotype, pathogenesis, and response to treatment. Irrespective of their type, however, most BCLs share two features: chromosomal translocations that involve an immunoglobulin gene and one or another proto-oncogene [ 2 ], and expression of a B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Chromosomal translocations have long been considered crucial to the pathogenesis of the tumors. But there is now increasing evidence that signaling from the BCR may be a coconspirator in that pathogenesis (for a review, see [ 3 ]). A BCR is expressed on normal B cells throughout the course of their development, and this expression appears to be essential for survival of the cells [ 4 ]. There is controversy, however, about whether the life-sustaining signal from the BCR is autogenous in nature or arises from antigenic stimulus [ 5 ]. The BCR expressed by BCLs is also apparently required for survival of the tumor cells and may drive cellular proliferation [ 6 ]. More than 40 years ago, Damashek and Schwartz proposed that antigenic stimulus might contribute to the genesis of BCLs in the context of autoimmune disease [ 7 ]. In the interim, circumstantial evidence has mounted to support a role for antigen stimulation in diverse forms of lymphomagenesis. For example, in some instances, the structure of the BCR on BCLs shows evidence of having been subjected to antigen selection [ 8 \u2013 14 ], and may even bind a known antigen\u2014either a protein encoded by a virus suspected of being an etiological agent, or an autoantigen [ 15 , 16 ]. We sought to test directly the role of the BCR in the genesis of BCLs by reconstruction in mouse models. We used a series of transgenic mice that allowed cooperation between either the constitutive or antigen-activated BCR with the proto-oncogene MYC , the activation of which by chromosomal translocation has been implicated in the genesis of human diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) [ 17 \u2013 19 ]. We derived these models from two strains of mice that express transgenes of MYC in the lymphoid lineage. In one strain (E\u03bc- MYC ), transcription of the transgene is driven by the control element for the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene [ 20 ]; in the other strain (MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC ), the MYC transgene is also transcribed in the B cell lineage, but the transcription is governed by a tetracycline responsive control element and can be repressed by administration of tetracycline or an analogue, doxycycline [ 21 \u2013 23 ]. We modified these transgenic strains so that their B-cell repertoire was dominated by a mature BCR for the antigen hen egg lysozyme (HEL), by breeding in a transgene for that receptor (BCR HEL ), whose expression was targeted to the B cell lineage [ 24 ]. We could then provide an antigenic stimulus by breeding in a transgene that produced a soluble version of the normally membrane-bound antigen (sHEL) [ 25 ]. This set of mouse models allowed us to examine whether either autogenous or antigen-induced signaling from the BCR could cooperate with overexpressed MYC in the initiation and maintenance of BCLs. Our results suggest that both forms of signaling from the BCR can cooperate with overexpressed MYC in tumorigenesis. The tumors that arose in mice expressing both BCR HEL and sHEL differed from those found in E\u03bc- MYC mice, and bore a striking resemblance to BL. Reconstruction experiments demonstrated that both the survival and proliferation of these tumors was dependent upon the cognate autoantigen for the BCR. We also found that BCR HEL itself could cooperate with MYC in tumorigenesis. The resulting tumors differed from both those in the E\u03bc- MYC mice and those in E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice, and resembled a subset of chronic B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). We attribute the phenotype of the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors to autogenous signaling from the BCR [ 4 , 26 ]. The requirement for continuous BCR signals in the maintenance of either the murine BL-like tumors or the B-CLL\u2013like tumors was authenticated by genetic and pharmacological disruption of signaling from the BCR. Our findings provide experimental support for previous suggestions that both autogenous and antigen-stimulated signaling from the BCR can contribute to lymphomagenesis; provide a direct demonstration that autoantigenic stimulation can contribute to lymphomagenesis; and sustain the view that the constitutive BCR gives rise to autogenous signals that differ from those elicited by antigen. This is also the first report, to our knowledge, in which the potential contributions of constitutive and antigen-stimulated BCR to lymphomagenesis are compared. The models that are dependent upon autoantigenic stimulation bear a close resemblance to human large BCLs, and to BL, in particular. The results also raise the possibility that interruption of signaling from the BCR may have therapeutic value in the treatment of BCLs that express the receptor. The animal models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics for lymphomas. To test the role of BCR signaling in lymphomagenesis, we generated mice containing B cells that both overexpressed MYC and had a known antigenic specificity at a high frequency. To that end, we bred a transgene for BCR HEL into E\u03bc- MYC mice, creating a strain designated E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL . Expression of the E\u03bc- MYC and BCR HEL transgenes was targeted to the B cell lineage [ 20 , 25 ]. Mice that express the E\u03bc- MYC transgene alone appear developmentally normal at first [ 27 ], but later accumulate a large number of polyclonal Pre/Pro-B cells (B220+, CD43+, IgM\u2013, IgD\u2013) in their bone marrow, and eventually also in their peripheral lymphoid organs, from which a monoclonal Pre/Pro BCL arises [ 20 ]. In contrast, the bone marrow and lymph nodes of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice contained normal numbers of mature B cells, which expressed BCR HEL on their surface (unpublished data).",
          "The B Cell Antigen Receptor and Overexpression of  [Chunk 5]\n\nA variety of circumstantial evidence from humans has implicated the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in the genesis of B cell lymphomas. We generated mouse models designed to test this possibility directly, and we found that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated state of a clonal BCR affected the rate and outcome of lymphomagenesis initiated by the proto-oncogene MYC. The tumors that arose in the presence of constitutive BCR differed from those initiated by MYC alone and resembled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (B-CLL), whereas those that arose in response to antigen stimulation resembled large B-cell lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma (BL). We linked the genesis of the BL-like tumors to antigen stimulus in three ways. First, in reconstruction experiments, stimulation of B cells by an autoantigen in the presence of overexpressed MYC gave rise to BL-like tumors that were, in turn, dependent on both MYC and the antigen for survival and proliferation. Second, genetic disruption of the pathway that mediates signaling from the BCR promptly killed cells of the BL-like tumors as well as the tumors resembling B-CLL. And third, growth of the murine BL could be inhibited by any of three distinctive immunosuppressants, in accord with the dependence of the tumors on antigen-induced signaling. Together, our results provide direct evidence that antigenic stimulation can participate in lymphomagenesis, point to a potential role for the constitutive BCR as well, and sustain the view that the constitutive BCR gives rise to signals different from those elicited by antigen. The mouse models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas, and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics.\n\nthe BCR, and that the signals generated by constitutive receptor may differ from those arising from an antigen-stimulated receptor (see Discussion ). We also explored whether the murine BL-like tumors were dependent on the continuous overexpression of MYC . To test this issue on established tumors, we allowed MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice to develop tumors in the absence of doxycycline. The mice were then given doxycycline-containing food in order to suppress the expression of the MYC transgene ( Figure S3 ). The tumors quickly regressed ( Figure 4 F and unpublished data). The establishment and maintenance of the BL-like tumors that arose following transplantation of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL cells into sHEL mice was also dependent upon the overexpression of MYC . This conclusion was based on several findings. First, the transplantation of cells MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL could not give rise to tumors if the transplanted cells were prohibited from expressing their MYC transgene by administration of doxycycline to the recipient mice ( Figure 4 B). Second, tumor cells that had arisen from the transplantation of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL cells could not be further passaged in the absence of overexpressed MYC ( Figure 4 D). And third, tumors that arose following transplantation of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL cells would regress once expression of the MYC transgene was extinguished with doxycycline ( Figure 4 E). We conclude that the development and maintenance of the BL-like tumors requires continuous stimulation by MYC . Previous observations have raised the possibility that expression of a BCR can contribute to the genesis of lymphomas (reviewed in [ 3 ]). We have used transgenic mice to explore this possibility. Our results demonstrated that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated states of the BCR can cooperate with overexpression of the proto-oncogene MYC in the genesis of BCLs. The types of B cell tumors produced in the two instances differ appreciably, with the former resembling a subset of human B-CLL, the latter resembling human BL. This work provides a direct demonstration that signaling from the BCR can contribute to lymphomagenesis. The mouse models described here should be useful for further study of tumorigenesis in the B cell lineage, and for preclinical testing of therapeutics. Previous work has shown that overexpression of MYC in the B cell lineage can give rise to lymphomas in mice (reviewed in [ 20 ]). We have now found that the BCR can both accelerate tumorigenesis by MYC and alter the nature of the resulting tumors. The acceleration is greater when the BCR is stimulated by antigen than when it is not, and the resulting tumors differ in their clinical behavior, anatomical presentation, histopathology, and surface phenotype. In addition, the two sorts of tumors respond differently to a trio of immunosuppressants, each of which can probably act on distinct signaling pathways activated by antigen receptor [ 37 \u2013 39 ]. We attribute these differences among the tumors to the fact that the BCR can apparently generate at least two forms of signals\u2014one produced by the binding of the cognate antigen, the other an \u201cautogenous\u201d signal generated by the ostensibly unstimulated receptor [ 5 ]. Our results sustain the view that the two forms of signals are different, suggest that this difference affects the nature of the tumors produced by MYC , and provide direct evidence that each of the two forms of signaling can contribute to lymphomagenesis\u2014a notion that has heretofore been based solely on correlative data. The biochemical nature of the constitutive signal derived from the BCR remains to be determined. Our genetic studies involving the disruption of Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 in established tumors suggests that both of those signaling chains are required for constitutive and cognate antigen triggered signals. The results we obtained showing differential sensitivity to cyclosporine A, FK506, and rapamycin in murine BL- and B-CLL\u2013like tumors suggest that the two signals derived from the BCR involve the activation of different transduction pathways. The tumor models we have developed may also enable us to dissect the molecular basis of constitutive BCR signaling in the context of B cell development and neoplasia. Signaling by the antigen-stimulated BCR has been studied in great depth [ 40 ]. It is known to mediate B cell proliferation and could contribute to tumorigenesis if sustained inappropriately. We have shown here that antigen-stimulated signaling from the BCR can cooperate with the oncogene MYC to produce tumors that remain dependent upon antigen and that resemble BL of humans. Yan et al. recently reported that autoantigenic drive may contribute to the genesis of a tumor resembling CD5+ B-CLL in mice expressing a transgene of TCL1 [ 41 ]. These authors suggested a link to BCR signaling, based on their analysis of endogenous BCR usage. The presence of repeated patterns may be suggestive of conserved antigenic stimulation, but is not definitive. Whether a common specificity is a foreign or self-antigen is also unclear from the pattern of BCR usage. A second tcl-1 transgenic mouse presented with a tumor phenotype of large BCLs (BL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)). Those tumors were all CD5 \u2013 , suggesting an inherent difference the two transgenic mouse strains that overexpress tcl-1 in both mature B-cell compartments [ 42 ]. A Bcl-6 transgenic mouse has also been reported to yield DLBCL-like tumors in mice that presented with a post-GC phenotype [ 43 ]. Importantly, our work involves the overexpression of MYC in the context of autoreactive B cells. The overexpression of MYC is the characteristic genetic lesion in BL, such that these mouse models are the most germane to the mechanisms that give rise to BL. Two recent reports have also implicated autoantigenic stimulation of B cells either in the genesis of a lymphoma that occurs in mice expressing a transgene for the TCL1 gene, and that resembles human B-CLL [ 41 ], or in the instance of DLBCL-like tumors that arose in Bcl-6 transgenic mice [ 43 ]. Subsequent analysis of the DLBCL-like tumors that develop in the Bcl-6 transgenic mice demonstrated a need for AID expression for the genesis of those post-GC B cell malignancies [ 44 ]. Our work provides a direct demonstration that autoantigenic stimulation can contribute to lymphomagenesis. The comparison of the constitutive and cognate-antigen\u2013stimulated BCR is unique in the context of tumorigenesis models. In fact, the models we have developed represent the closest genotypic and phenotypic approximation to human BL. In contrast, the autogenous form of BCR signaling remains something of an enigma [ 5 ]. Both the origin and the effectors of this signal are less understood than antigen-dependent BCR signals, but the signal appears to be important in B cell development and survival of mature, na\u00efve B cells, and is implicated in homeostatic control over the size of the lymphoid compartment between immune responses [ 4 , 6 ]. It is not clear if the same signal is responsible for these several functions; alternatively, the responsible signals might differ from one another either quantitatively or qualitatively. In the present work, an autogenous signal from a mature BCR cooperated with MYC to produce a lymphoma that was distinctively different from the tumor produced when the same BCR was subjected to sustained antigenic stimulus. This finding sustains the view that autogenous and antigen-stimulated signaling from the BCR must differ in some way. In a previous report, introduction of a transgene for the human IgH chain into E\u03bc- MYC mice delayed the onset of tumors and sometimes changed the involved cells to the myeloid and T cell lineages [ 45 ]. Using a different strain of E\u03bc- MYC mice [ 20 ], we found that a murine BCR accelerated tumorigenesis and did not change the affected lineage.",

In contrast, the bone marrow and lymph nodes of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice contained normal numbers of mature B cells, which expressed BCR HEL on their surface (unpublished data). Thus, the developmental arrest normally observed in E\u03bc- MYC mice was apparently corrected by the introduction of an antigen receptor transgene, in accord with previous results [ 28 ]. The E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice provided a means to test for cooperation between signaling from the BCR and overexpression of MYC in the genesis of lymphoid tumors. The E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice developed fatal lymphomas more rapidly than did E\u03bc- MYC mice ( Figure 1 A), and the anatomical distribution of the tumor was different ( Figure 2 ). These observations are based on the detailed analysis of tumor that arose in 80 individual mice, maintained in three different animal facilities in two institutions. We consistently observed this phenotype in the tumors, in spite of previous reports of some low frequency of mature B cell malignancies [ 29 , 30 ]. The emergence of tumors was followed in three ways: by anatomical inspection, by counting the total number of cells in organs ( Figure 2 ), and by flow cytometric analysis to enumerate B cells carrying BCR HEL ( Figure S1 ). (A) Survival. Strains of mice in groups of 50 were observed over a period of 36 wk. Deceased mice were examined by necropsy. Death was uniformly attributable to lymphoid tumors. The difference among the mortality curves for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice and that of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL transgenic mice to each other had a significance value p = 0.05. The difference between the mortality curves for those two sets of mice and the other mice represented in the graph was p = 0.005. In addition, the statistical significance of the difference between the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL transgenic mice and any other groups of mice presented in the graph is p < 0.01. (B) Jaw tumor in 16-wk-old MMTV-rtTA/TRE-M YC /BCR HEL /sHEL mouse. Single-cell suspensions were generated from lymph nodes (six nodes for each mouse \u2013 a pair of inguinal, axillary and brachial lymph nodes), spleens, thymii and jaw-tumors. The bar graphs represent the total number of cells (x10 \u22126 ) obtained for the indicated organs. Counts represent the mean derived from 10 independent mice \u00b1 the standard deviation for those values. Healthy animals were euthanized at 21 d of age, E\u03bc- MYC mice at 200\u2013240 d, E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice at 112\u2013130 d, E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice at 26\u201330 d, and MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /sHEL/BCR HEL mice at 71\u201386 d. All tumors contained homogeneous populations of cells with distinctive surface phenotypes: B220+/IgM- cells for E\u03bc- MYC tumors, B220+/IgM a + cells for both E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, and B220+/BCR HEL cells for MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. Open bars represent normal mice. Filled bars represent tumor-bearing mice. Evidence of tumor in E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice appeared first in the spleen at about 18 wk of age, then in lymph nodes and the bone marrow. Histological examination of the tumors revealed a diffuse and homogeneous population of small lymphocytes ( Figure 3 C and 3 H). Analysis with a panel of cell-surface markers identified the tumor cells as mature but na\u00efve B cells, reminiscent of those found in a subset of human B-CLL ( Table 1 and Figure S1 ), whereas the E\u03bc- MYC tumors were composed of Pre/Pro B-cells ( Table 1 , in accord with [ 20 ]). In addition, the tumors in E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice appear to be mature na\u00efve B cells that are CD5\u2013. In human B-CLL, the two main subsets are CD5+ and CD5\u2013. Tumors composed of mature, na\u00efve B cells also arose in MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL mice that had not been exposed to doxycycline (unpublished data). Those mice overexpress MYC from a different control element, but developed the same sort of tumors as observed with the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL transgenes ( Table 1 and Table S1 ). We conclude that a constitutive BCR can cooperate with MYC in the genesis of BCLs and can elicit a distinctive phenotype in the tumor cells. We attribute the findings to a previously described form of autogenous signaling from the BCR [ 4 , 26 ] (See Discussion ). Tissues were sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and microscopic images obtained as described in Methods. Magnification was 10X for (A\u2013E), 100X for (F\u2013J). (A and F) Spleen from a normal wild-type mouse. (B and G) Lymph node tumor from an E\u03bc- MYC mouse. (C and H) Spleen tumor from an E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mouse. (D and I) Spleen tumor from an E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mouse. (E and J) Jaw tumor from an MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mouse. Cell-Surface Markers of BCLs To explore how antigen stimulation of BCR HEL might affect tumorigenesis by MYC , we bred a ubiquitously expressed transgene for sHEL into the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL background. The resulting strain (E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL) developed tumors even more rapidly than did E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice ( Figure 1 A). Overgrowth of B cells could be detected in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus ( Figure 2 ). B cells also infiltrated the liver, lungs, and central nervous system. Compression and invasion of the spinal cord caused paralysis of the hind and fore limbs. Histological examination revealed a homogeneous population of large lymphocytes in the spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, and bone marrow. The sheets of cells had a \u201cstarry sky\u201d appearance ( Figure 3 D and 3 I) that is common among large BCLs and is a prominent feature of BL [ 31 ]. This designation results from the presence of sheets of monomorphic cells interspersed with macrophages that have engulfed apoptotic cells. When examined for surface markers, the tumor cells closely resembled mature, activated B lymphocytes that have experienced the germinal center (GC). Further evidence for the GC origins of these cells will be presented below. As expected, the tumor cells were specific for HEL, as evidenced by their ability to bind the antigen ( Table 1 ). We also bred the BCR HEL and sHEL transgenes into a second strain of mice that expresses MYC in the B cell lineage (MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC )(see Introduction and Materials and Methods). The final composite strain was designated MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL. We originally created these mice for other purposes, but the manner in which they developed tumors proved noteworthy for the present context. The mice died somewhat later than the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice, but earlier than the other strains analyzed in the present study ( Figure 1 A). In a striking departure from our previous experience, however, tumors appeared first in the jaw, in a randomly unilateral manner ( Figure 1 B). The mice eventually developed a more generalized disease, with tumor cells appearing in multiple lymphoid organs and infiltrating nonlymphoid tissues as well ( Figure 2 and unpublished data). We observed this phenotype in 53 of 60 mice that were analyzed. The remaining seven mice in that cohort of 60 animals was only found to be sick at a very advanced stage of the disease, so we can not formally state that they initially presented with a randomly unilateral tumor in the jaw. The histological appearance of the tumors was similar to that of the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, including a starry sky appearance ( Figure 3 E and 3 J). The surface phenotype of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor cells also resembled that of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors ( Table 1 and Figure S1 ). The jaw tumors were covered with a thin layer of calcified material (unpublished data), a feature not associated with tumors at other sites or in the other strains of mice. The endemic form of BL initially presents in a randomly unilateral manner in the jaw (see Discussion )."

This study examined a range of perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance among young women, and how these varied by socioeconomic status (SES), overweight status and domestic situation. In October-December 2001, a total of 445 women aged 18\u201332 years, selected randomly from the Australian electoral roll, completed a mailed self-report survey that included questions on 11 barriers to physical activity and 11 barriers to healthy eating (relating to personal, social and environmental factors). Height, weight and socio-demographic details were also obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost. Women with children were particularly likely to report a lack of social support as an important barrier to physical activity, and lack of social support and time as important barriers to healthy eating. Perceived barriers did not differ by SES or overweight status. Health promotion strategies aimed at preventing weight gain should take into account the specific perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating faced by women in this age group, particularly lack of motivation, lack of time, and cost.

          "The B Cell Antigen Receptor and Overexpression of  [Chunk 3]\n\nA variety of circumstantial evidence from humans has implicated the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in the genesis of B cell lymphomas. We generated mouse models designed to test this possibility directly, and we found that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated state of a clonal BCR affected the rate and outcome of lymphomagenesis initiated by the proto-oncogene MYC. The tumors that arose in the presence of constitutive BCR differed from those initiated by MYC alone and resembled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (B-CLL), whereas those that arose in response to antigen stimulation resembled large B-cell lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma (BL). We linked the genesis of the BL-like tumors to antigen stimulus in three ways. First, in reconstruction experiments, stimulation of B cells by an autoantigen in the presence of overexpressed MYC gave rise to BL-like tumors that were, in turn, dependent on both MYC and the antigen for survival and proliferation. Second, genetic disruption of the pathway that mediates signaling from the BCR promptly killed cells of the BL-like tumors as well as the tumors resembling B-CLL. And third, growth of the murine BL could be inhibited by any of three distinctive immunosuppressants, in accord with the dependence of the tumors on antigen-induced signaling. Together, our results provide direct evidence that antigenic stimulation can participate in lymphomagenesis, point to a potential role for the constitutive BCR as well, and sustain the view that the constitutive BCR gives rise to signals different from those elicited by antigen. The mouse models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas, and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics.\n\nCR HEL cells into sHEL mice and introduced these into either wild-type or a second set of sHEL mice that were not treated with doxycycline. Donor cells again amplified rapidly in the sHEL mice, but not in wild-type recipients ( Figure 4 C). Tumors resulted in death of the recipient mice within 12\u201316 d, a latency appreciably shorter than that observed after the preceding transplantation (28\u201330 d). The flow cytometric profile of the donor cells changed after their encounter with antigen. The donor cells expressed B220, BCR HEL , CD19, CD21, and CD23, but did not express CD69 or B7\u20132 on their surface. The cells that resulted from the expansion following antigenic stimulation in vivo showed a loss of CD23 expression and high levels of CD69 and B7\u20132 expression (unpublished data). The same phenotype was observed with the cells that had expanded following the second transplantation into sHEL recipient mice. This phenotype is typical of antigen-activated B cells. In addition, it is similar to what we initially observed in the cells from tumors that arose in the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice and, thus, also resembles the phenotype of BL ( Table 1 ). We conclude that the appearance and expansion of HEL-specific, BL-like tumor cells in the recipient mice were dependent on stimulation by the cognate antigen. In contrast to the preceding findings, tumor cells obtained from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice or MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice would grow into lethal tumors when transplanted into recipient mice in the absence of HEL antigen ( Figure 4 A, 4 C, and 4F). We postulated that this seeming independence of antigen was due to the intrinsic production of antigen by the tumor cells themselves, as would be expected from the genotype of the cells. That proved to be the case. We were able to detect HEL transcripts and HEL protein in cells obtained from either a primary E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor or an MMTV-TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor, but not in cells obtained from either E\u03bc- MYC or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors (unpublished data). Similarly, we found HEL protein in tumors that arose following transplantation of cells from a primary E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor. We conclude that the murine BL cells are in fact antigen-dependent, but can be sustained by either autocrine or paracrine stimulus. To further test the role of antigen stimulation in the genesis of the B-CLL\u2013 and BL-like tumors, we disrupted the molecular machinery that generates and transmits signals from the BCR. By transduction of suitable interfering RNAs into established tumor cells, we were able to suppress the expression of the Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 signaling chains of the BCR. We have previously shown that these shRNA sequences targeting Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 lead to substantial reduction in the levels of Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 protein in K46\u03bc B cells, respectively [ 33 ]. We have observed that shRNAs directed at either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 individually caused a decrease in the levels of surface IgM in transduced B cells. Importantly, the expression of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 on the cell surface modulates the surface expression of IgH and IgL, the antigen-specific components of the BCR. The vector used for transduction was a lentivirus that has been previously described [ 34 ]. The viruses tested in vitro and in vivo were the parental vector encoding either GFP (pLL3.7) or Thy1.1 (pLL3.77) as a reporter gene, and variants encoding both a reporter gene and shRNAs for either Ig\u03b1, Ig\u03b2, or firefly luciferase, the last as a negative control. Transduction was performed with tumor cells isolated from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice. The rates of transduction varied between 5%\u201350% of the tumor cells ( Figure 5 A). The cells were then maintained in culture and evaluated on a daily basis for reporter gene expression. (A) Cell lines were generated from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors and designated as DBL114, or from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors and designated TBL-1. These cell lines uniformly express B220 and IgM on their surface. To determine whether the shRNA sequences targeting Ig\u03b1 were able to knock down their target protein, we measured the levels of IgM expressed on the surface of DBL-114 cells that were transduced with lentiviral constructs that encode a reporter gene ( GFP ). The expression of IgM on the surface is co-modulated with Ig\u03b1 expression, hence the loss of Ig\u03b1 should reduce the levels of surface IgM. The panels represent the flow cytometric profile of the DBL-114 cells that had been transduced with the parental virus (pLL3.7), or a variant that encodes an shRNA specific for firefly luciferase, as a negative control, or two variants of pLL3.7 that encode different shRNAs specific for Ig\u03b1. The GFP-positive cells in the panels that contained shRNAs specific for Ig\u03b1 showed a loss of surface IgM expression. This is not the case for the GFP-negative fraction of the same cell populations. Similar results were obtained in TBL-1 cells (unpublished data). (B) The shRNA-mediated knock-down of Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 in cells obtained from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors confers a competitive disadvantage on those cells in vitro, compared to their nontransduced counterparts. Single-cell suspensions were generated from the respective tumors, and used for lentiviral transductions. The cells were maintained in cultured and assayed for GFP expression, by flow cytometry every 24 h. The data for the GFP+ fraction in the population of cells harboring a lentivirus encoding and shRNA was divided by the fraction of GFP+ cells in the population of cells that was transduced with the parental vector, in order to standardize the values and examine the rates of change from the starting level of GFP+ cells, as previously reported [ 104 ]. The cells that were transduced with lentiviruses encoding shRNAs specific for either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 exhibited a significant competitive disadvantage when compared to the cells harboring lentiviruses encoding shRNAs specific for firefly luciferase. All wells were set up in triplicates. The graphs represent data from one experiment, representative of eight independent experiments. (C) In vivo validation of the effects of Ig\u03b1-specific shRNAs on the maintenance of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors. Cells were obtained from E\u03bc-MYC/BCR HEL tumors, and transduced in vitro with pLL3.77-sh.luciferase (uses thy1.1 as a reporter gene) or pLL3.7-sh.Ig\u03b1.1 (uses GFP as a reporter gene). The different cell populations were then mixed in order to generate mixtures of cells that contained an approximately equal fraction of cells that harbored the control lentivirus (pLL3.77.sh.luciferase) and the experimental lentivirus (pLL3.7.sh.Ig\u03b1). The mixtures of cells were transplanted into cohorts of Rag-1 \u2013/\u2013 mice. The mice were observed daily until they exhibited externally evident signs of lymphoma, and the organs were harvested. The graphs represent the fraction of cells in the tumorous lymph nodes that retained expression of either thy1.1 (for the control lentivirus), or GFP (for the Ig\u03b1-specific lentivirus. These results confirm the requirement for Ig\u03b1 expression in the maintenance of the murine BCLs. We observed that for both E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, the percentage of cells transduced with either the parental lentivirus, or the variant that encoded shRNA specific to firefly luciferase, did not change appreciably during a 14 day period ( Figure 5 B). In contrast, each of the cultures that was transduced with a lentiviral variant that encoded shRNAs specific to either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 displayed a significant decrease in the frequency of the cells expressing the reporter gene ( Figure 5 B). The same pattern was observed with two independent shRNAs for each of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2. This in vitro competition assay suggested that loss of signaling from the BCR placed the tumor cells at a significant disadvantage when compared to their counterparts that had retained normal signaling from the BCR."

          "Antitumor effects of two bisdioxopiperazines against two experimental lung cancer models  [Chunk 1]\n\nProbimane (Pro), an anti-cancer agent originating in China, was derived from razoxane (ICRF-159, Raz), a drug created in Britain, specifically targeting at cancer metastasis and as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines. Pro and Raz are bisdioxopiperazine compounds. In this work, we evaluated the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of Pro and Raz in vivo against two lung tumor models, one of murine origin (Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC) and one of human origin (LAX-83). After determining the lethal dosage of Pro and Raz, we assessed and compared the inhibitory effects of Pro and Raz against primary tumor growth and metastatic occurrences of LLC at the dosage of LD5. Pro and Raz were active against primary tumor growth and significantly inhibited pulmonary metastasis of LLC at same dose-ranges (inhibitory rates > 90 %). Both Raz and Pro were effective in 1, 5, and 9 day administration schedules. Three different schedules of Raz and Pro were effective against the primary tumor growth of LLC (35\u201350 %). The synergistic anticancer effect of Raz with bleomycin (Ble) (from 41.3 % to 73.3 %) was more obvious than those with daunorubicin (Dau) (from 33.1 % to 56.3 %) in the LLC tumor model. Pro was also seen to have synergistic anti-cancer effects with Ble in the LLC model. Both Raz and Pro inhibited the growth of LAX 83 in a statistically significant manner. These data suggest that both Raz and Pro may have anti-tumor potentiality and Raz and Pro have combinative effects with Ble or Dau. The potential targets of bisdioxopiperazines may include lung cancers, especially on tumor metastasis. The anti-cancer effects of Raz and Pro can be increased with the help of other anticancer drugs.\n\nObvious necrosis in tumor tissues was observed by histological evaluation of CTX and Pro treatment groups, but Pro showed larger vacuoles than CTX . Drug inhibition on tumor volumes were calculated and outlined in Table 8 . We have tested the 5 most commonly used anticancer drugs \u2013 cyclophosphamide (CTX), 5-fluoruoracil (5-Fu), methotrexate (MTX), cisplatin (DDP) and vincristine (VCR) (Table 9 ). In the LAX-83 model, CTX has been shown to be the most effective one. The anticancer effect of Pro was the same or better than those of MTX, DDP and as well as 5-Fu against LAX-83 tumor growth. Antitumor activities of Pro and Raz on human tumor LAX-83 using subrenal capsule assay: Route: ip \u00d7 5 daily from the day after surgery. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.001 (treatment vs vehicle control). Experiment was completed within 7 days. Tumor volume = 1/2 \u00d7 width 2 \u00d7 length (using T-test) Antitumor activities of anticancer drugs on human tumor LAX-83 using subrenal capsule assay: Route: ip \u00d7 5 daily from the day after surgery. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.001 (treatment vs vehicle control). Experiment was completed within 7 days. Tumor volume = 1/2 \u00d7 width 2 \u00d7 length (using T-test) Explanations of anticancer and antimetastatic mechanisms of bisdioxopiperazines are now inconclusive. The present explanation for the anticancer mechanisms of Raz has been attributed to antiangiogenesis and topoisomerase II inhibition.[ 16 ] Since the antimetastatic activities of Raz and Pro were much stronger than those actions against primary tumor growth, this special targeting on metastasis ought to be more useful in clinical cancer treatment. Raz and Pro show typical characteristics of antiangiogenesis agents, which target small nodule of tumors. Meanwhile, recent reports on drugs targeting angiogenesis indicate that most anti-vascular drugs have low or even no effects on most cancers when they are used alone in clinics, but they show synergistic effects in combination with other anticancer drugs. [ 17 , 18 ] Our study shows synergistic anticancer actions of Raz and Pro with Ble or Dau basing on this theory. Previous work showed that Pro and Raz could reduce the cardiotoxicity of anthrocycline ,[ 1 , 9 , 10 ] so we may reasonably deduce that they can also reduce the cytotoxicity of anthrocyclines . The data in our study suggests that the synergistic effects of Raz with anthrocyclines are present, but not as potent as those with Ble . Since we have tested the antitumor activity of clinically available anticancer drugs (CTX, 5-Fu, MTX, DDP and VCR) against LAX-83, CTX being the best one, two bisdioxopiperazines studied on this work show overall similar anticancer effective as commonly used drugs. Although the anticancer effects of CTX and VCR are better than those of Pro, for other commonly used drugs, such as DDP, MTX and 5-Fu, the antitumor effects are no better than those of Pro. Since the antitumor effects of MTX and DDP are even less effective than those of Pro and Raz , we suggest that anticancer effects of Pro and Raz are within the effective anticancer ranges of commonly available anticancer drugs. The other useful property of Pro is that it is the most water-soluble among the bisdioxopiperazines . Most bisdioxopiperazines are less water-soluble and given orally in clinics. Although oral administration is easy for patients, bioavailability varies from patient to patient. For some patients who have a poor absorption of bisdioxopiperazines in oral administration, Pro can be injected iv to maintain stable drug levels. Our previous work showed that Pro could strongly accumulate in tumor tissue while Pro levels in other tissues decrease rapidly [ 19 ]. Presently, a stereo-isomer of Raz , (dexrazoxane, ICRF-187 ), a water-soluble Raz, is being reinvestigated and has aroused the interests of clinical oncologists. Phase III clinical studies are currently underway in the US. More importantly, ICRF-187 was licensed in 28 countries in 4 continents. This work shows a noticeable inhibition of Pro and Raz on lung cancers and suggests possible usage of Raz and Pro on lung cancer in clinics. The advantages of bisdioxopiperazines in clinical treatment of lung cancers are as follows: (i) Pro and Raz can inhibit the growth of lung cancers, with and without the help of other anticancer drugs, like Dau and Ble ; (ii) like Raz , Pro strongly inhibits spontaneous pulmonary metastasis of LLC ; (iii) since Pro can inhibit CaM [ 11 ], a calcium activated protein that's associated with MDR and metastatic phenotypes, synergistic anticancer effects of Pro and Raz can be expected in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, like Dau or Ble . Now, new concepts of the relationship between tumor metastasis and MDR in cancers have been stated,[ 20 ] whereas bisdioxopiperazines can inhibit both tumor metastasis and MDR . As a counterpart of Raz , Pro might be of interest and have chemotherapeutic potential in clinics. Cyclophosphomide ( CTX ), daunorubicin ( Dau ) and bleomycin ( Ble ), 5-fluororacil (5-Fu), vincristine (VCR), cisplatin (DDP), methotrexate (MTX) were purchased from Shanghai Pharmaceutical Company. Pro and Raz were prepared by Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences. C57BL/6J and Kun-Min strain mice were purchased from Shanghai Center of Laboratory Animal Breeding, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Nude mice (Swiss-DF), taken from Roswell Park Memorial Institute, USA, were bred in Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences under a specific pathogen free condition. Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma xenograft ( LAX-83 )[ 21 ] and Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) were serially transplanted in this laboratory. All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Research Animals, NIH, established by Washington University's Animal Studies Committee. Bouin's solution consists of water saturated with picric acid: formaldehyde: glacial acetic acid (75: 20: 5, v/v/v). Mice of Kun-Min strain (equal amount of male and female) were ip injected with Pro and Raz daily for 10 successive days. The deaths of mice were counted after 1 month. Lethal dosage of agents was calculated by Random Probity tests . C57BL/6J mice were implanted sc with LLC (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) from donor mice. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs daily or every two days for 7 injections. On day 11 or day 20, mice were sacrificed, and locally growing tumors were separated from skin and muscles and weighed, and lungs of host mice were placed into a Bouin's solution for 24 h, and then the lung samples were submerged into a solution of 95 % alcohol for 24 h. Finally, the numbers of extruding metastatic foci in lungs were counted. C57BL/6J mice were implanted sc with LLC (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) from donor mice. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs on day 1, 5, 9. Single injection or 3 injections every 3 hours were used. Tumors were separated and weighed on day 11. Nude mice were inoculated with LAX-83 under the renal capsule (SRC method).[ 22 ] Nude mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs daily during next five days after inoculation of LAX-83 . Then nude mice were sacrificed, and their kidneys were taken out for measurement of tumor sizes using a stereomicroscope a week after transplantation. Tumor volume was calculated as 1/2(ab 2 ) where a and b are their major and minor axes of the lump. Kidneys with tumors were paraffin-embedded, sliced and hematoxylin dyed. The tumor tissues were then observed from a light microscope. Student's t-test was used to assess the differences between control and drug treatment groups of above methods.

More importantly, Raz , as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines, has been licensed in 28 countries in 4 continents. Since morpholine groups in some structures were reported to be responsible for cytotoxic or modulative actions on tumors, an anticancer agent, probimane [1,2-bis (N 4 -morpholine-3, 5-dioxopeprazine-1-yl) propane; AT-2153, Pro] was synthesized by introducing two morpholine groups into Raz in China.[ 5 ]. Raz and Pro belong to bisdiopiperazines . Like Raz , Pro also exhibits anti-tumor activity both in vivo and in vitro against experimental tumor models in a small scale investigation [ 6 , 7 ] and limited clinical data showed that Pro could inhibit human malignant lymphoma even for those resistant to other anticancer drugs [ 8 ]. Pro exhibits the same pharmacological effects as Raz , like detoxication of Adriamycin ( ADR ) induced cardiotoxicities, and synergism with ADR against tumors [ 9 , 10 ]. We have found some novel biological effects of Pro , like inhibiting the activity of calmodulin ( CaM ), a cell-signal regulator, which can explain anticancer actions and the combined cytotoxic effect of Pro and ADR [ 11 ]. Pro was also shown to inhibit lipoperoxidation ( LPO ) of erythrocytes [ 12 ], influence tumor sialic acid synthesis [ 13 ] and inhibit the binding of fibrinogen to leukemia cells [ 14 ]. Lung cancer is the No 1 killer among all categories of cancers in urban areas in China and many Western countries. The high mortality rate of lung cancer can easily be caused by inducing multi-drug resistance ( MDR ) and by high metastatic occurrence in clinics [ 15 ]. Since we assume that Pro , like Raz may possess useful therapeutic potentialities, we evaluated in vivo the chemotherapeutical parameters of Pro and Raz for lung cancer of both murine and human origins. The lethal dosage of Pro and Raz is tabulated in Table 1 . Since the toxicity of Pro and Raz seemed to lack sex specificity in mice, we were able to combine their numbers for LD 50 and LD 5 calculations. We used the approximate dosage of LD 5 of Pro (60 mg/kg ip \u00d7 7) and Raz (20 mg/kg ip \u00d7 7) as equitoxic dosages for further treatment studies. The subacute toxicity of Pro and Raz in mice: Mouse survival was observed for 1 month. The numbers of mice in each group were 20 for each of the 5 dosages of a single agent. Antitumor and antimetastatic effects of Pro and Raz on LLC are tabulated in Table 2 and Table 3 . Pro and Raz at equitoxic dosages (LD 5 ) showed a noticeable anticancer effect on primary tumor growth (inhibitory rates, approximately 30\u201345 %), and significantly inhibited the formation of tumor metastases (inhibitory rates on pulmonary metastasis > 90 %, P < 0.001). Primary tumor growth of LLC was inhibited more by Pro (48 %) than by Raz (40.3%) in a 20 day trial, whereas the inhibition of Pro (35.7%) was slightly less than that of Raz (40 %) on an 11 day trial. Pro seems to be more persistent than Raz in inhibiting primary tumor growth of LLC . Antitumor effects of Raz and Pro on LLC are included in Table 4 , 5 , 6 . We evaluated 1, 5 and 9 day administration schedules in our study. We found that Raz and Pro were effective in a statistically significant manner with the 3 injection schedule of the 1, 5 and 9 day administrations on LLC . If we administered Raz to tumor-bearing mice once on day 1, 5 and 9, there was no difference between treatment and vehicle control. Antitumor effects of Raz in combination with Ble on LLC (73.3 %) were better than those in combination with Dau (56.3 %) (Table 5 and Table 6 ). Pro also showed synergistic effects in combination with Ble (Table 7 ). The influence of Pro and Raz on primary tumor of LLC (using Student T-test): Route: ip \u00d7 7 daily. Experiment term was 11 days. * P < 0.05 (treatment vs vehicle control). The numbers of mice were 30 for the control group and 20 for each treatment group. 100 % survival was observed in each group.

Experimental term was 11 days Antitumor effects of Pro on Lewis lung carcinoma in combination with daunorubicin or bleomycin: *Administration every 3 hours. Experimental term was 11 days The experiments showed that LAX-83 was sensitive to Raz (40\u201360 mgKg -1 , ip \u00d7 5) and Pro (80\u2013100 mgKg -1 ip \u00d7 5) with inhibitory rates of 25\u201332 % and 55\u201360 % respectively (P < 0.01 vs control). CTX , as a positive anticancer drug (40 mgKg -1 ip \u00d7 5), exhibited antitumor activities against the growth of LAX-83 with an inhibitory rate of 84 %. Obvious necrosis in tumor tissues was observed by histological evaluation of CTX and Pro treatment groups, but Pro showed larger vacuoles than CTX . Drug inhibition on tumor volumes were calculated and outlined in Table 8 . We have tested the 5 most commonly used anticancer drugs \u2013 cyclophosphamide (CTX), 5-fluoruoracil (5-Fu), methotrexate (MTX), cisplatin (DDP) and vincristine (VCR) (Table 9 ).",

Experiment was completed within 7 days. Tumor volume = 1/2 \u00d7 width 2 \u00d7 length (using T-test) Explanations of anticancer and antimetastatic mechanisms of bisdioxopiperazines are now inconclusive. The present explanation for the anticancer mechanisms of Raz has been attributed to antiangiogenesis and topoisomerase II inhibition.[ 16 ] Since the antimetastatic activities of Raz and Pro were much stronger than those actions against primary tumor growth, this special targeting on metastasis ought to be more useful in clinical cancer treatment. Raz and Pro show typical characteristics of antiangiogenesis agents, which target small nodule of tumors. Meanwhile, recent reports on drugs targeting angiogenesis indicate that most anti-vascular drugs have low or even no effects on most cancers when they are used alone in clinics, but they show synergistic effects in combination with other anticancer drugs. [ 17 , 18 ] Our study shows synergistic anticancer actions of Raz and Pro with Ble or Dau basing on this theory. Previous work showed that Pro and Raz could reduce the cardiotoxicity of anthrocycline ,[ 1 , 9 , 10 ] so we may reasonably deduce that they can also reduce the cytotoxicity of anthrocyclines . The data in our study suggests that the synergistic effects of Raz with anthrocyclines are present, but not as potent as those with Ble . Since we have tested the antitumor activity of clinically available anticancer drugs (CTX, 5-Fu, MTX, DDP and VCR) against LAX-83, CTX being the best one, two bisdioxopiperazines studied on this work show overall similar anticancer effective as commonly used drugs. Although the anticancer effects of CTX and VCR are better than those of Pro, for other commonly used drugs, such as DDP, MTX and 5-Fu, the antitumor effects are no better than those of Pro. Since the antitumor effects of MTX and DDP are even less effective than those of Pro and Raz , we suggest that anticancer effects of Pro and Raz are within the effective anticancer ranges of commonly available anticancer drugs. The other useful property of Pro is that it is the most water-soluble among the bisdioxopiperazines . Most bisdioxopiperazines are less water-soluble and given orally in clinics. Although oral administration is easy for patients, bioavailability varies from patient to patient. For some patients who have a poor absorption of bisdioxopiperazines in oral administration, Pro can be injected iv to maintain stable drug levels. Our previous work showed that Pro could strongly accumulate in tumor tissue while Pro levels in other tissues decrease rapidly [ 19 ]. Presently, a stereo-isomer of Raz , (dexrazoxane, ICRF-187 ), a water-soluble Raz, is being reinvestigated and has aroused the interests of clinical oncologists. Phase III clinical studies are currently underway in the US. More importantly, ICRF-187 was licensed in 28 countries in 4 continents. This work shows a noticeable inhibition of Pro and Raz on lung cancers and suggests possible usage of Raz and Pro on lung cancer in clinics. The advantages of bisdioxopiperazines in clinical treatment of lung cancers are as follows: (i) Pro and Raz can inhibit the growth of lung cancers, with and without the help of other anticancer drugs, like Dau and Ble ; (ii) like Raz , Pro strongly inhibits spontaneous pulmonary metastasis of LLC ; (iii) since Pro can inhibit CaM [ 11 ], a calcium activated protein that's associated with MDR and metastatic phenotypes, synergistic anticancer effects of Pro and Raz can be expected in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, like Dau or Ble . Now, new concepts of the relationship between tumor metastasis and MDR in cancers have been stated,[ 20 ] whereas bisdioxopiperazines can inhibit both tumor metastasis and MDR . As a counterpart of Raz , Pro might be of interest and have chemotherapeutic potential in clinics. Cyclophosphomide ( CTX ), daunorubicin ( Dau ) and bleomycin ( Ble ), 5-fluororacil (5-Fu), vincristine (VCR), cisplatin (DDP), methotrexate (MTX) were purchased from Shanghai Pharmaceutical Company. Pro and Raz were prepared by Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences. C57BL/6J and Kun-Min strain mice were purchased from Shanghai Center of Laboratory Animal Breeding, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Nude mice (Swiss-DF), taken from Roswell Park Memorial Institute, USA, were bred in Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences under a specific pathogen free condition. Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma xenograft ( LAX-83 )[ 21 ] and Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) were serially transplanted in this laboratory. All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Research Animals, NIH, established by Washington University's Animal Studies Committee. Bouin's solution consists of water saturated with picric acid: formaldehyde: glacial acetic acid (75: 20: 5, v/v/v). Mice of Kun-Min strain (equal amount of male and female) were ip injected with Pro and Raz daily for 10 successive days. The deaths of mice were counted after 1 month. Lethal dosage of agents was calculated by Random Probity tests . C57BL/6J mice were implanted sc with LLC (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) from donor mice. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs daily or every two days for 7 injections. On day 11 or day 20, mice were sacrificed, and locally growing tumors were separated from skin and muscles and weighed, and lungs of host mice were placed into a Bouin's solution for 24 h, and then the lung samples were submerged into a solution of 95 % alcohol for 24 h. Finally, the numbers of extruding metastatic foci in lungs were counted. C57BL/6J mice were implanted sc with LLC (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) from donor mice. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs on day 1, 5, 9. Single injection or 3 injections every 3 hours were used. Tumors were separated and weighed on day 11. Nude mice were inoculated with LAX-83 under the renal capsule (SRC method).[ 22 ] Nude mice were injected intraperitoneally with drugs daily during next five days after inoculation of LAX-83 . Then nude mice were sacrificed, and their kidneys were taken out for measurement of tumor sizes using a stereomicroscope a week after transplantation. Tumor volume was calculated as 1/2(ab 2 ) where a and b are their major and minor axes of the lump. Kidneys with tumors were paraffin-embedded, sliced and hematoxylin dyed. The tumor tissues were then observed from a light microscope. Student's t-test was used to assess the differences between control and drug treatment groups of above methods.

          "Loss of Robustness and Addiction to IGF1 during Early Keratinocyte Transformation by Human Papilloma Virus 16 [Chunk 2]\n\nInfection of keratinocytes with high risk human Papilloma virus causes immortalization, and when followed by further mutations, leads to cervical cancer and other anogenital tumors. Here we monitor the progressive loss of robustness in an in vitro model of the early stages of transformation that comprises normal keratinocytes and progressive passages of HPV16 immortalized cells. As transformation progresses, the cells acquire higher proliferation rates and gain the ability to grow in soft agar. Concurrently, the cells lose robustness, becoming more sensitive to serum starvation and DNA damage by Cisplatin. Loss of robustness in the course of transformation correlates with significant reductions in the activities of the anti-apoptotic proteins PKB/Akt, Erk, Jnk and p38 both under normal growth conditions and upon stress. In parallel, loss of robustness is manifested by the shrinkage of the number of growth factors that can rescue starving cells from apoptosis, with the emergence of dependence solely on IGF1. Treatment with IGF1 activates PKB/Akt and Jnk and through them inhibits p53, rescuing the cells from starvation. We conclude that transformation in this model induces higher susceptibility of cells to stress due to reduced anti-apoptotic signaling and hyper-activation of p53 upon stress.\n\n24 h serum starvation and reaction of the blots with anti-PARP antibody showed that cells died via apoptosis. In primary keratinocytes, which were not affected by starvation, PARP was not cleaved. PARP was clearly cleaved upon starvation of early HF1 cells and even more dramatically in late HF1 cells ( Figure 2B ). We also immuno-stained cytochrome C to monitor its release from the mitochondria. We already detected cytochrome C release after 12 h of starvation in late HF1 cells, but not in primary keratinocytes or early HF1 cells, which are more resistant to the stress ( Figure 2C ). In order to see whether the increased sensitivity to stress was a more general phenomenon or restricted to starvation, we exposed the cells to the DNA damaging agent, Cisplatin. Cisplatin treatment induced cell death in all three cell types and again, sensitivity increased with transformation ( Figure 2D ). Treatment with 20 \u00b5M Cisplatin for 48 h induced 35% death of normal keratinocytes, 50% death of early HF1 and \u223c80% death of late HF1 cells. A. Cells were serum starved (white) or untreated (black) for 48 h. After treatment, cells were fixed, stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. The sub-G1 fraction of the cells was quantified as a measure of cell death. Error bars represent the standard error of three independent experiments. B. Representative western blot of cells after 24 h starvation. PARP cleavage reflects caspase activation during apoptosis. Tubulin serves as a loading control. C. Immuno-staining of cytochrome C after 12 h serum starvation (Bar = 15 \u00b5m). D. Cells were treated with 20 \u00b5M Cisplatin for 48 h, fixed and analyzed as in A. Error bars represent the standard error of three independent experiments. These experiments show a clear increase in sensitivity to stress as a result of cell immortalization and in vitro passaging. Stress induced faster activation of mitochondrial apoptosis, which results in caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. The fact that only HF1 cells, but not the primary keratinocytes, were sensitive to serum starvation provided a convenient, clear-cut system for further analysis. We therefore concentrated our studies on the response of HF1 cells to serum starvation. It has been shown that expression of the E6 or E7 genes of HPV often increases stress sensitivity [14] \u2013 [17] . Since transformation in our system initiated with HPV16 transfection, we examined the expression of the viral genes and their targets, p53 and Rb, to see whether the increased stress sensitivity could be attributed to their expression. Since there are no efficient antibodies against E6, and the E6 and E7 genes are co-regulated, E7 expression is a valid indicator for viral gene expression. The E7 protein was very highly expressed in early HF1 cells, and its level was markedly reduced in late HF1 cells ( Figure 3A ). Our results suggest that the viral proteins trigger the initiation of transformation, but their effects are reduced in later stages. In agreement with the expression of E7, the Rb protein level was reduced in early HF1 cells, but elevated in late HF1 cells. Thus Rb expression did not correlate with sensitivity to stress. A. Representative western blots of whole cell lysates of primary keratinocytes, early and late HF1 cells under basal growth conditions. Blots show the status of HPV16 E7 protein, Rb and p53. Graphs show quantification of these blots. Protein densities were normalized to the densities of the bands in early HF1 cells. Error bars represent the standard deviations of three independent experiments. Tubulin serves as a loading control. B. Real-time PCR for NOXA expression under basal conditions. RNA was isolated from untreated cells and subjected to reverse-transcription followed by real-time PCR with specific primers for NOXA and HPRT as control. NOXA results were normalized to the HPRT results. Error bars represent the standard errors of three independent experiments. C. Real-time PCR for NOXA expression in starved vs. untreated cells. Cells were serum starved for 24 h, RNA was isolated, reverse-transcribed and subjected to real-time PCR as in B. Fold induction represents results of starved cells vs. non-starved cells. Error bars represent the standard error of three independent experiments. D. Reporter assay for p53 activity in untreated and serum starved cells. Cells were transfected with firefly-luciferase (FFL), either under the control of 17 p53-response elements, or under the control of mutant response elements as control. For transfection control cells were co-transfected with renilla-luciferase under the control of CMV promoter. 24 h after transfection cell medium was replaced with normal growth medium or starvation medium, for another 24 h. Cells were lysed and subjected to luminisence assay. Error bars represent standard errors of four independent experiments. The level of p53 was gradually reduced upon progression from primary keratinocytes, through early to late HF1 cells ( Figure 3A ). P53 appeared in the western blot as three bands; the lower band was intensified in late HF1 cells, but the other two almost disappeared. Sequencing of p53 cDNA in these cells revealed no mutation or deletion in the p53 coding sequence (data not shown), so the three bands appear to represent wt p53 with different post-translational modifications. The p53 protein is very highly regulated, mainly via phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation [18] . Reaction with several antibodies that recognize different phosphorylated forms of p53 did not shed light on the protein's activity in the various cell types (not shown). In order to compare p53 activity in the three cell types under normal growth conditions we looked at the expression of p53 targets. Table 1 shows expression levels of six known p53 targets, which were obtained from Affymetrix micro-arrays (Kravchenko-Balasha, in preparation). There was a gradual decrease in the expression of GADD45, p21, MMP2 and TGFalpha from the primary keratinocytes through early HF1 cells, to late HF1 cells. NOXA and IGFBP3 expression rose slightly in early HF1 cells, but was dramatically reduced in the later stage. GAPDH expression is given as an internal control for constant mRNA expression. NOXA is a known mediator of the anti-apoptotic effects of p53 [19] . We therefore validated the micro-array results by real-time PCR of this gene and normalized NOXA expression to the expression of the house-keeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Indeed, NOXA RNA levels rose slightly in early HF1 cells, but was markedly reduced in late HF1 cells ( Figure 3B ). Integration of the micro-array data and real-time PCR results show a marked reduction in its basal activity in late HF1 cells, but not in early HF1 cells. Table1: Expression of p53 targets according to Affymetrix Human Genome U133A microarrays. Results were normalized to the expression in the primary keratinocytes. GAPDH expression is given as internal control. Standard deviations are of three arrays for each cell type. Due to the possible involvement of p53 in the stress response, we examined the changes in p53 activity after serum starvation. We used NOXA as a marker for pro-apoptotic p53 activity. Surprisingly, real-time PCR of NOXA showed that although the basal NOXA RNA level was reduced, induction in response to starvation increased as transformation proceeded ( Figure 3C ). We confirmed these results with a reporter assay, where firefly-luciferase (FFL) was expressed under the control of p53-response elements, with mutant response elements serving as controls. Differences in transfection efficiency were eliminated by normalization to renilla-luciferase under the control of the CMV-promoter. FFL activity was measured under basal growth conditions and following 24 h starvation.",
          "Antitumor effects of two bisdioxopiperazines against two experimental lung cancer models  [Chunk 2]\n\nProbimane (Pro), an anti-cancer agent originating in China, was derived from razoxane (ICRF-159, Raz), a drug created in Britain, specifically targeting at cancer metastasis and as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines. Pro and Raz are bisdioxopiperazine compounds. In this work, we evaluated the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of Pro and Raz in vivo against two lung tumor models, one of murine origin (Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC) and one of human origin (LAX-83). After determining the lethal dosage of Pro and Raz, we assessed and compared the inhibitory effects of Pro and Raz against primary tumor growth and metastatic occurrences of LLC at the dosage of LD5. Pro and Raz were active against primary tumor growth and significantly inhibited pulmonary metastasis of LLC at same dose-ranges (inhibitory rates > 90 %). Both Raz and Pro were effective in 1, 5, and 9 day administration schedules. Three different schedules of Raz and Pro were effective against the primary tumor growth of LLC (35\u201350 %). The synergistic anticancer effect of Raz with bleomycin (Ble) (from 41.3 % to 73.3 %) was more obvious than those with daunorubicin (Dau) (from 33.1 % to 56.3 %) in the LLC tumor model. Pro was also seen to have synergistic anti-cancer effects with Ble in the LLC model. Both Raz and Pro inhibited the growth of LAX 83 in a statistically significant manner. These data suggest that both Raz and Pro may have anti-tumor potentiality and Raz and Pro have combinative effects with Ble or Dau. The potential targets of bisdioxopiperazines may include lung cancers, especially on tumor metastasis. The anti-cancer effects of Raz and Pro can be increased with the help of other anticancer drugs.\n\nhen observed from a light microscope.

          "Perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to weight maintenance among young women: A community survey [Chunk 2]\n\nYoung women are a group at high risk of weight gain. This study examined a range of perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance among young women, and how these varied by socioeconomic status (SES), overweight status and domestic situation. In October-December 2001, a total of 445 women aged 18\u201332 years, selected randomly from the Australian electoral roll, completed a mailed self-report survey that included questions on 11 barriers to physical activity and 11 barriers to healthy eating (relating to personal, social and environmental factors). Height, weight and socio-demographic details were also obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost. Women with children were particularly likely to report a lack of social support as an important barrier to physical activity, and lack of social support and time as important barriers to healthy eating. Perceived barriers did not differ by SES or overweight status. Health promotion strategies aimed at preventing weight gain should take into account the specific perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating faced by women in this age group, particularly lack of motivation, lack of time, and cost. Strategies targeting perceived lack of time and lack of social support are particularly required for young women with children.\n\nh item showed the largest loading. The Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficients for the three factors ranged from 0.68 to 0.76, indicating moderate internal reliability. Provisional names were assigned for these three factors: 'personal barriers', 'social support barriers' and 'environmental barriers'. The items included as personal barriers to physical activity were related to motivation, enjoyment, and skill. Social support barriers encompassed lack of support from family and friends; and environmental barriers related to information, access, cost, and time. The principal components analysis of the 11 barriers to healthy eating resulted in two distinct interpretable factors with eigenvalues greater than one (Table 2 ). The Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficients for the two factors were 0.72 and 0.83, indicating moderate to good internal reliability. Together the two factors explained 53% of the total variance. Provisional names were assigned to these factors: 'personal and environmental barriers' and 'social and environmental barriers'. Personal and environmental barriers to healthy eating included motivation, enjoyment, skills, information, cost, and access. Social and environmental barriers were related to lack of support from family and friends and time constraints. Mean factor scores did not vary according to women's overweight status or SES. Mean factor scores did differ significantly by domestic situation for two factors: social support barriers to physical activity and social and environmental barriers to healthy eating (see Table 3 ). Compared with women living in other domestic situations, women with children had the lowest score on the social support for physical activity factor, suggesting that lack of support from partners, children and friends was a more important perceived barrier to physical activity for these women. This group also had the lowest score on social and environmental barriers to healthy eating factor, suggesting that lack of social support and insufficient time were more important perceived barriers to healthy eating among women with children than among other women. Conversely, young women who lived with their parents had the highest scores on these factors, indicating the relative lack of importance of social support for physical activity, and social and environmental barriers to healthy eating, for this group. Mean standardized factor scores on weight maintenance by domestic situation a a . A large positive score represents more important barriers; a large negative score, less important barriers. This study suggests that a lack of motivation, time constraints due to work, and cost issues are the key perceived barriers to maintaining weight faced by young women. Overall these findings support other research that has examined barriers to physical activity and healthy eating [ 18 , 22 , 25 , 39 ]. However, the present study is unique in providing an insight into the relative importance of a range of personal, social and environmental factors as perceived barriers to weight maintenance among young women, a high risk group for weight gain. Findings showed that young women tended to rate personal factors as key perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating, followed by environmental factors, with social factors rated as less important. While the environment is likely to be an important source of influence on obesity-related behaviours [ 40 ], these findings highlight that efforts to prevent obesity should not ignore the central role of cognitive factors. Given the striking similarities in the types of barriers reported to impede physical activity, and the perceived barriers to healthy eating, findings also suggest that there may be potential economies of scale in health promotion programs aimed at preventing weight gain among young women. For example, strategies aimed at boosting motivation for healthy behaviour may help to promote both increased physical activity and healthy eating simultaneously. While motivating young healthy women to adopt healthy eating and physical activity behaviors is likely to be challenging, recent intervention research suggests that motivationally-tailored interventions may be more successful that other approaches (e.g. based on social-cognitive theory) in promoting physical activity and healthy eating [ 41 , 42 ]. It is noteworthy that perceived barriers to weight maintenance did not vary by socio-economic status or overweight status in this sample of women. In contrast, previous research has shown that overweight men and women face a number of perceived physical activity barriers [ 32 ]. Similarly, given that diet varies by socio-economic status [ 43 , 44 ] we expected that women of lower socio-economic status would be more likely to experience barriers to eating a healthy diet. Previous studies also suggest that persons of low SES often live in areas where the cost of food is greater, and access to healthy foods is poorer [ 30 , 31 ]. The reasons for the difference between the present results and earlier findings are unclear. It may be, however, that in this sample of relatively young women, many were still acquiring their education, and hence any SES differences in perceived barriers to healthy behaviours were not yet established. Compared to other young women, those living with children were the most likely to report lack of social support for physical activity, and lack of support and time for healthy eating, as key perceived barriers to maintaining their weight. Young women who lived with their parents were the least likely to perceive these to be barriers to weight maintenance. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies showing that getting married and having children are associated with decreased physical activity and greater weight gain [ 21 , 26 ]. Any weight gain prevention program targeting women with children should incorporate a focus on enlisting social support for both physical activity, and shopping for and preparing healthy foods. In a previous study with the same sample, we reported that while the majority of the women were in a healthy weight range (51%) or overweight/obese (31%), 18% of the women were underweight [ 21 ]. It should be acknowledged that some women in this sample, particularly those who were underweight, may have been trying to gain weight. One limitation of the present study was that the questions assessing perceived barriers to weight maintenance did not distinguish women trying to keep their weight down, from those trying to keep their weight up, and interpretation of the questions on perceived barriers may have been slightly different between these groups. However, attempts to gain weight are relatively uncommon among young women [ 45 ], and hence this is likely to have affected only a small proportion of the sample. A second limitation of this study is that the barriers were not assessed objectively, but rather through self-reports (ie perceived barriers). Nonetheless, it is important to consider women's perceptions of factors hindering their efforts to engage in healthy behaviours, since objective barriers may be perceived differently by different women (e.g., poor access to a gym may be viewed as less of a barrier to physical activity among a woman who walks for exercise than one who prefers aerobics). Finally, although the study achieved a somewhat modest response rate, the sample was selected from a nationally representative sampling frame and the socio-demographic profile of women was comparable to that of similarly-aged women in the wider population [ 35 ]. The findings of this study highlight the need for health promotion strategies that provide increased motivation, support and skills to enable young women to shop and prepare healthy, quick and inexpensive meals. Similarly, the findings suggest a need to promote more time-efficient physical activity alternatives.",

        "query": "How do vaccines work in the immune system?",
        "answer": "Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to recognize and respond to specific pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria. When a vaccine is administered, it typically contains a harmless component of the pathogen, such as an inactivated or attenuated virus, or a piece of the pathogen like a protein or sugar. This component is known as an antigen.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief overview of how vaccines function in the immune system:\n\n1. **Recognition**: Once the vaccine is introduced into the body, the immune system recognizes the foreign antigen as a potential threat. This triggers an immune response.\n\n2. **Activation of Immune Cells**: The recognition of the antigen activates various immune cells, including B cells and T cells. B cells are responsible for producing antibodies, which are proteins that specifically target the antigen. T cells can kill infected cells or help coordinate the immune response.\n\n3. **Antibody Production**: B cells, once activated, proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibodies specific to the vaccine's antigen. These antibodies can neutralize the pathogen if encountered in the future.\n\n4. **Memory Formation**: After the initial response, some B cells and T cells become memory cells. These cells persist in the body long after the initial exposure and enable the immune system to respond more rapidly and effectively if the same pathogen is encountered again in the future.\n\n5. **Protection**: If the vaccinated individual is later exposed to the actual pathogen, the immune system can recognize it quickly and mount a robust response, often neutralizing the pathogen before it can cause illness.\n\nThis process exemplifies how vaccines prepare the immune system for future encounters with specific pathogens, enhancing the body\u2019s ability to fight infections. While the documents provided do not directly address this mechanism, the general understanding of vaccine function in the immune system is well-established in immunology.",

          "The B Cell Antigen Receptor and Overexpression of  [Chunk 7]\n\nA variety of circumstantial evidence from humans has implicated the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in the genesis of B cell lymphomas. We generated mouse models designed to test this possibility directly, and we found that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated state of a clonal BCR affected the rate and outcome of lymphomagenesis initiated by the proto-oncogene MYC. The tumors that arose in the presence of constitutive BCR differed from those initiated by MYC alone and resembled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (B-CLL), whereas those that arose in response to antigen stimulation resembled large B-cell lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma (BL). We linked the genesis of the BL-like tumors to antigen stimulus in three ways. First, in reconstruction experiments, stimulation of B cells by an autoantigen in the presence of overexpressed MYC gave rise to BL-like tumors that were, in turn, dependent on both MYC and the antigen for survival and proliferation. Second, genetic disruption of the pathway that mediates signaling from the BCR promptly killed cells of the BL-like tumors as well as the tumors resembling B-CLL. And third, growth of the murine BL could be inhibited by any of three distinctive immunosuppressants, in accord with the dependence of the tumors on antigen-induced signaling. Together, our results provide direct evidence that antigenic stimulation can participate in lymphomagenesis, point to a potential role for the constitutive BCR as well, and sustain the view that the constitutive BCR gives rise to signals different from those elicited by antigen. The mouse models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas, and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics.\n\nat are ubiquitous in the B cell lineage of the transgenic animals: overexpression of MYC and stimulus by an autoantigen. Thus, a vast population of cells may be predisposed to tumor progression. Indeed, it is remarkable that the resulting tumors are composed of only a finite number of clones, suggesting the occurrence of clonal selection for tumorigenic events beyond those imposed experimentally. The results contrast sharply with the innumerable clones that proliferate to produce a relatively indolent disease in MRL mice, a proliferation that is itself driven by autoimmunity . A variety of circumstantial evidence has implicated antigenic stimulus in the genesis of BL [ 83 ]. First, chronic infection with malaria in Africa is associated with an increased incidence of BL and accelerated progression of the disease [ 84 , 85 ]. Second, the possibility of sustained antigenic stimulus is raised by the mature, activated immunophenotype characteristic of BL cells [ 86 ]. Third, the sequences for the immunoglobulin molecules in many NHL, including BL, bear somatic mutations of the sort that normally arise during the process of affinity maturation [ 8 \u2013 14 ] If antigenic stimulation does play a role in the genesis of human BL, it would be in cooperation with MYC , whose activation by chromosomal translocation is a general feature of the tumor [ 87 ]. Our results with mouse models suggest that the hypothetical role of antigenic stimulus in the pathogenesis of BL should be pursued further. We have shown that antigenic stimulus can apparently contribute to the establishment and maintenance of B-cell lymphomas in mice. The tumors that arose in the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL and MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice expressed a neo-autoantigen (sHEL), which provided an autoimmune stimulus to the tumor cells. This in turn allowed the tumors to become self-sufficient and retain continuous cognate antigen stimulation upon transplantation. This notion was further supported by experiments in which the signaling components of the BCR were genetically disrupted with shRNAs. The requirement for antigen in turn suggested that the tumors might respond to pharmacological interruption of signaling from the BCR. This proved to be the case: treatment with cyclosporin, FK506, or rapamycin elicited prolonged remissions. These results conform to the view that antigen-induced signaling from the BCR was involved in the genesis of the tumors. We recognize, however, that none of the immunosuppressants acts exclusively on signaling from the BCR and, as a result, each might inhibit tumors by a different means [ 88 \u2013 90 ]. For example, it has been reported that rapamycin can inhibit angiogenesis in certain solid tumors [ 91 ], whereas other immunosuppressants failed to demonstrate this inhibition. In contrast, rapamycin, cyclosporin, and FK506 all inhibit signaling from the BCR [ 92 \u2013 94 ], and all three elicited remissions of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL and MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. Moreover, this uniform effect of the three immunosuppressants did not extend to tumors in which antigen stimulus ostensibly played no role (E\u03bc- MYC and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL ). We conclude that the therapeutic effects of immunosuppressants reported here for the BL model probably reflect the role of antigen-induced signaling from the BCR in the pathogenesis of the tumor. Tactics that interrupt expression of signaling from the BCR might also be useful in the treatment of human lymphomas that express the receptor. Mice carrying the E\u03bc- MYC transgene have been described previously [ 20 ] and were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. These mice express MYC in a B cell\u2013specific manner, beginning at the Pre/Pro-B cell stage. The TRE- MYC and MMTV-rtTA mice have been described previously [ 21 , 23 ]. We crossbred these strains to combine the two transgenes in a single strain (MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC), in which the B cell\u2013specific expression of the MYC transgene can be repressed by the administration of tetracycline or doxycycline. We also used both BCR HEL mice, which express a pre-rearranged murine BCR from the endogenous immunoglobulin promoter, and sHEL mice, which ubiquitously express a transgene for the soluble form of soluble HEL under the control of the metallothionein promoter. These two strains have been described previously [ 25 ] and were generously provided by Jason Cyster (University of California, San Francisco). We also used a strain of mice in which a previously rearranged IgH VDJ sequence was knocked into the IgH locu [ 95 ]. When used in combination with another strain, encoding an IgL transgene (Lt-tg), those bigenic mice generate about 30% HEL-specific B cells, as previously describe[ 95 ]5]. Those two strains of mice were kindly provided by Jason Cyster, at UCSF. All transgenic mouse lines were maintained on a C57/BL6 background, and were genotyped by PCR as previously described [ 20 , 25 , 96 ]. All animals were maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the Committee on Animal Research at the University of California, San Francisco, and the National Research Council. Adoptive transfers of cells and transplantation of tumors were done by injecting 10 6 cells intravenously (unless otherwise indicated) into syngeneic (C57/BL6) females ranging in age from 4\u20136 wk. For the experiments that involved tumor cells obtained from MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, the recipient mice were sublethally irradiated (450 rads) in order to overcome some remaining allogeneic differences between the two strains. The emergence of tumors was followed in three ways: (i) physical examination of living animals and necropsy of deceased animals, particularly to detect enlargement of lymphoid organs and viscera; (ii) counting the total number of cells in organs; and (iii) the specific enumeration of B cells carrying cell-surface receptor for the antigen HEL. Three pairs of lymph nodes were collected each time (two inguinal, two axillary, and two brachial lymph nodes). These lymph nodes were pooled and processed into single-cell suspensions. Spleens and thymii were also collected and used to generate single-cell suspensions. Each spleen or thymus was individually ground on a 60-\u03bcm wire mesh screen (Sigma). The red blood cells were lysed in TAC buffer (0.017 M Tris, pH 7.65, and 0.135 M NH 4 Cl), as previously described [ 95 ], and the resulting pellets were resuspended in complete lymphocyte media, which consists of RPMI1640 + 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, supplemented with L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, nonessential amino acids, 2 mM HEPES, 2mM sodium pyruvate, and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoeathanol (all obtained from Invitrogen). Single-cell suspensions were counted with a Coulter counter (Coulter Diagnostics). The percentage of viable cells was determined by uptake of 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD) and flow cytometry. The values for total cell numbers were used to derive the number of viable cells by multiplying percentage of viable cells (obtained from the 7AAD analysis) by the total number of cells (obtained from the Coulter counter analysis), and dividing by 100. These measurements were compared with microscopic counting of trypan-blue excluding cells in a hemocytometer. To determine the number of B cells carrying the BCR HEL transgene, single-cell suspensions were stained with antibodies to B220 and IgM a (both obtained from Pharmingen Laboratories), followed by flow cytometric analysis. The number of BCR HEL + B cells was determined by multiplying the percentage of B220+/IgM a + cells (obtained from the FACS analysis) by the number of total viable cells and dividing by 100. These values were compared to stains performed using a pan-specific antibody to IgM (Pharmingen Laboratories). This approach was used to determine the number of BCR HEL expressing cells in all the cases where the mice were on a C57/BL6 background, where the allotype expressed is normally IgM b .",
          "The B Cell Antigen Receptor and Overexpression of  [Chunk 3]\n\nA variety of circumstantial evidence from humans has implicated the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in the genesis of B cell lymphomas. We generated mouse models designed to test this possibility directly, and we found that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated state of a clonal BCR affected the rate and outcome of lymphomagenesis initiated by the proto-oncogene MYC. The tumors that arose in the presence of constitutive BCR differed from those initiated by MYC alone and resembled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (B-CLL), whereas those that arose in response to antigen stimulation resembled large B-cell lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma (BL).

The mouse models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas, and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics.\n\nCR HEL cells into sHEL mice and introduced these into either wild-type or a second set of sHEL mice that were not treated with doxycycline. Donor cells again amplified rapidly in the sHEL mice, but not in wild-type recipients ( Figure 4 C). Tumors resulted in death of the recipient mice within 12\u201316 d, a latency appreciably shorter than that observed after the preceding transplantation (28\u201330 d). The flow cytometric profile of the donor cells changed after their encounter with antigen. The donor cells expressed B220, BCR HEL , CD19, CD21, and CD23, but did not express CD69 or B7\u20132 on their surface. The cells that resulted from the expansion following antigenic stimulation in vivo showed a loss of CD23 expression and high levels of CD69 and B7\u20132 expression (unpublished data). The same phenotype was observed with the cells that had expanded following the second transplantation into sHEL recipient mice. This phenotype is typical of antigen-activated B cells. In addition, it is similar to what we initially observed in the cells from tumors that arose in the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice and, thus, also resembles the phenotype of BL ( Table 1 ). We conclude that the appearance and expansion of HEL-specific, BL-like tumor cells in the recipient mice were dependent on stimulation by the cognate antigen. In contrast to the preceding findings, tumor cells obtained from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice or MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice would grow into lethal tumors when transplanted into recipient mice in the absence of HEL antigen ( Figure 4 A, 4 C, and 4F). We postulated that this seeming independence of antigen was due to the intrinsic production of antigen by the tumor cells themselves, as would be expected from the genotype of the cells. That proved to be the case. We were able to detect HEL transcripts and HEL protein in cells obtained from either a primary E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor or an MMTV-TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor, but not in cells obtained from either E\u03bc- MYC or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors (unpublished data). Similarly, we found HEL protein in tumors that arose following transplantation of cells from a primary E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumor. We conclude that the murine BL cells are in fact antigen-dependent, but can be sustained by either autocrine or paracrine stimulus. To further test the role of antigen stimulation in the genesis of the B-CLL\u2013 and BL-like tumors, we disrupted the molecular machinery that generates and transmits signals from the BCR. By transduction of suitable interfering RNAs into established tumor cells, we were able to suppress the expression of the Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 signaling chains of the BCR. We have previously shown that these shRNA sequences targeting Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 lead to substantial reduction in the levels of Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 protein in K46\u03bc B cells, respectively [ 33 ]. We have observed that shRNAs directed at either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 individually caused a decrease in the levels of surface IgM in transduced B cells. Importantly, the expression of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 on the cell surface modulates the surface expression of IgH and IgL, the antigen-specific components of the BCR. The vector used for transduction was a lentivirus that has been previously described [ 34 ]. The viruses tested in vitro and in vivo were the parental vector encoding either GFP (pLL3.7) or Thy1.1 (pLL3.77) as a reporter gene, and variants encoding both a reporter gene and shRNAs for either Ig\u03b1, Ig\u03b2, or firefly luciferase, the last as a negative control. Transduction was performed with tumor cells isolated from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice. The rates of transduction varied between 5%\u201350% of the tumor cells ( Figure 5 A). The cells were then maintained in culture and evaluated on a daily basis for reporter gene expression. (A) Cell lines were generated from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors and designated as DBL114, or from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors and designated TBL-1. These cell lines uniformly express B220 and IgM on their surface. To determine whether the shRNA sequences targeting Ig\u03b1 were able to knock down their target protein, we measured the levels of IgM expressed on the surface of DBL-114 cells that were transduced with lentiviral constructs that encode a reporter gene ( GFP ). The expression of IgM on the surface is co-modulated with Ig\u03b1 expression, hence the loss of Ig\u03b1 should reduce the levels of surface IgM. The panels represent the flow cytometric profile of the DBL-114 cells that had been transduced with the parental virus (pLL3.7), or a variant that encodes an shRNA specific for firefly luciferase, as a negative control, or two variants of pLL3.7 that encode different shRNAs specific for Ig\u03b1. The GFP-positive cells in the panels that contained shRNAs specific for Ig\u03b1 showed a loss of surface IgM expression. This is not the case for the GFP-negative fraction of the same cell populations. Similar results were obtained in TBL-1 cells (unpublished data). (B) The shRNA-mediated knock-down of Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 in cells obtained from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL or E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors confers a competitive disadvantage on those cells in vitro, compared to their nontransduced counterparts. Single-cell suspensions were generated from the respective tumors, and used for lentiviral transductions. The cells were maintained in cultured and assayed for GFP expression, by flow cytometry every 24 h. The data for the GFP+ fraction in the population of cells harboring a lentivirus encoding and shRNA was divided by the fraction of GFP+ cells in the population of cells that was transduced with the parental vector, in order to standardize the values and examine the rates of change from the starting level of GFP+ cells, as previously reported [ 104 ]. The cells that were transduced with lentiviruses encoding shRNAs specific for either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 exhibited a significant competitive disadvantage when compared to the cells harboring lentiviruses encoding shRNAs specific for firefly luciferase. All wells were set up in triplicates. The graphs represent data from one experiment, representative of eight independent experiments. (C) In vivo validation of the effects of Ig\u03b1-specific shRNAs on the maintenance of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors. Cells were obtained from E\u03bc-MYC/BCR HEL tumors, and transduced in vitro with pLL3.77-sh.luciferase (uses thy1.1 as a reporter gene) or pLL3.7-sh.Ig\u03b1.1 (uses GFP as a reporter gene). The different cell populations were then mixed in order to generate mixtures of cells that contained an approximately equal fraction of cells that harbored the control lentivirus (pLL3.77.sh.luciferase) and the experimental lentivirus (pLL3.7.sh.Ig\u03b1). The mixtures of cells were transplanted into cohorts of Rag-1 \u2013/\u2013 mice. The mice were observed daily until they exhibited externally evident signs of lymphoma, and the organs were harvested. The graphs represent the fraction of cells in the tumorous lymph nodes that retained expression of either thy1.1 (for the control lentivirus), or GFP (for the Ig\u03b1-specific lentivirus. These results confirm the requirement for Ig\u03b1 expression in the maintenance of the murine BCLs. We observed that for both E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, the percentage of cells transduced with either the parental lentivirus, or the variant that encoded shRNA specific to firefly luciferase, did not change appreciably during a 14 day period ( Figure 5 B). In contrast, each of the cultures that was transduced with a lentiviral variant that encoded shRNAs specific to either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 displayed a significant decrease in the frequency of the cells expressing the reporter gene ( Figure 5 B). The same pattern was observed with two independent shRNAs for each of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2. This in vitro competition assay suggested that loss of signaling from the BCR placed the tumor cells at a significant disadvantage when compared to their counterparts that had retained normal signaling from the BCR.",
          "The B Cell Antigen Receptor and Overexpression of  [Chunk 4]\n\nA variety of circumstantial evidence from humans has implicated the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in the genesis of B cell lymphomas. We generated mouse models designed to test this possibility directly, and we found that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated state of a clonal BCR affected the rate and outcome of lymphomagenesis initiated by the proto-oncogene MYC. The tumors that arose in the presence of constitutive BCR differed from those initiated by MYC alone and resembled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (B-CLL), whereas those that arose in response to antigen stimulation resembled large B-cell lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma (BL). We linked the genesis of the BL-like tumors to antigen stimulus in three ways. First, in reconstruction experiments, stimulation of B cells by an autoantigen in the presence of overexpressed MYC gave rise to BL-like tumors that were, in turn, dependent on both MYC and the antigen for survival and proliferation. Second, genetic disruption of the pathway that mediates signaling from the BCR promptly killed cells of the BL-like tumors as well as the tumors resembling B-CLL. And third, growth of the murine BL could be inhibited by any of three distinctive immunosuppressants, in accord with the dependence of the tumors on antigen-induced signaling. Together, our results provide direct evidence that antigenic stimulation can participate in lymphomagenesis, point to a potential role for the constitutive BCR as well, and sustain the view that the constitutive BCR gives rise to signals different from those elicited by antigen. The mouse models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas, and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics.\n\nyed a significant decrease in the frequency of the cells expressing the reporter gene ( Figure 5 B). The same pattern was observed with two independent shRNAs for each of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2. This in vitro competition assay suggested that loss of signaling from the BCR placed the tumor cells at a significant disadvantage when compared to their counterparts that had retained normal signaling from the BCR. In addition, these results demonstrate that the signaling components of the BCR are required for tumors that depend on autogenous signaling by the BCR-derived signals as well as for those that rely on the cognate-antigen\u2013induced BCR signals. To verify these observations in vivo, we isolated tumor cells from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice, and transduced them as described above. We then transplanted the transduced tumor cells into Rag-1 \u2013/\u2013 mice, to evaluate tumor fitness in the absence of any T cell responses to the reporter genes. In this instance, we mixed tumor cells that had been transduced with pLL3.77 (providing thy1.1 as a reporter) encoding an shRNA to firefly luciferase with tumor cells transduced with pLL3.7 (providing GFP as a reporter) encoding shRNAs specific to either Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2. This would provide internal controls for each of the mice we transplanted in the cohort. We euthanized the mice 21 days after transplantation, when they developed external signs associated with lymphoma (scruffy fur, hunched posture, lymphadenopathy, dehydration, labored breathing, and an ascending hind limb paralysis). The lymph nodes and spleens were collected and used to generate single-cell suspensions. The cells were then stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. Tumor cells transduced with either pLL3.7-sh.Ig\u03b1 or pLL3.7-shIg\u03b2 failed to expand in vivo ( Figure 5 C), mirroring the results obtained in vitro. In contrast, the nontransduced cells, or the cells transduced with pLL3.77-sh.Luc, expanded in vivo and gave rise to the resulting malignancies. In addition, the genetic disruption of Syk, a key membrane-proximal element of the BCR signal, also conferred a significant competitive disadvantage to established BCL cells in a manner analogous to what we present here with Ig\u03b1 or Ig\u03b2 (RMY and YR, unpublished results). These results show that for both tumor types, the acute loss of the signaling components of the BCR complex resulted in a severe competitive disadvantage in vivo, suggesting that these two types of tumors are dependent upon continuous signaling from the BCR. The apparent contribution of BCR signaling to the development of murine lymphomas prompted us to explore the effect of immunosuppressants on the various mouse models. We used cyclosporin A, FK506, and rapamycin to treat well advanced tumors that had been initiated by transplantation. We compared the effects of these agents to that of cyclophosphamide, an agent commonly used to treat human BL [ 35 ]. We transplanted 10 6 cells obtained from tumor-bearing spleen or lymph nodes into cohorts of 4\u201310 mice. The recipient mice were held for observation until they developed externally obvious lymphadenopathy (approximately 100 d for the E\u03bc- MYC tumors, 58 d for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors, 21 d for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, and 14 d for the MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors). The tumor bearing and control wild-type mice were then treated daily for 7 d with intravenous injections of the various drugs. Mice were either euthanized 24 h after the last injection of drug, or held indefinitely to ascertain duration of survival. The analysis of tumor burden was performed with cells obtained from lymph nodes and spleens. The E\u03bc- MYC tumors did not respond to any of the immunosuppressive drugs we tested ( Figure 6 A and 6 E). Disease progressed at the same rate in treated and untreated mice. Histological examination of the affected organs also revealed no evidence of therapeutic response (unpublished data). In contrast, the transplanted E\u03bc- MYC tumors showed a strong response to cyclophosphamide, as previously described [ 36 ]. Treatment with cyclophosphamide elicited tumor regression in all animals, but also caused a more general cytotoxicity, manifested as a reduction in T cells, myeloid cells, and nontransgenic B cells (unpublished data). Similar toxicity from cyclophosphamide was also observed in wild-type mice. Tumor cells were harvested from lymph nodes and spleens and transplanted as described in Methods. The recipient mice were held until tumors became clinically apparent. Tumor recipient (open bars) and wild type (filled bars) mice then received daily injections of the indicated drugs for 7 d of either cyclosporine A (csa), FK506, rapamycin (rap), or cyclophosphamide (cyph). For (A\u2013H), the mice were euthanized 24 h after the last injection of drug, and lymph nodes were harvested for analysis of either total number of cells (A\u2013D) (expressed in single units representing 10 6 cells each) or surface markers of donor cells (E\u2013H). For (I), the mice were observed over a span of 100 da and deaths recorded, as shown. (A and E) E\u03bc- MYC tumors. (B and F) E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors. (C and G) E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. (D and H) MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. (I) Survival of animals bearing E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors. The statistical significance of the differences observed in the kinetics of mortality between the tumor-bearing mice that were either untreated, or treated transiently with cyclophosphamide is 0.01. The statistical significance of the difference in the mortality curves observed between those two groups and the tumor-bearing mice treated with either of the three immunosuppressant drugs is p < 0.001. The tumors derived from the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice responded to cyclophosphamide and cyclosporin, but not to either FK506 or rapamycin ( Figure 6 B and 6 F). In contrast, the tumors from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice, as well as tumors from the jaws of MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice, responded to both cyclophosphamide and all three of the immunosuppressants tested ( Figure 6 C, 6 D, 6 G, 6 H). The different sensitivities of the tumors derived from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL mice and those derived from either E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL or MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice suggests that the constitutive and cognate-antigen\u2013derived BCR signals may be qualitatively distinct. Remissions of E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors persisted for at least 5 mo, following a 7-d course of treatment with immunosuppressants ( Figure 6 I and unpublished data). In contrast, the animals treated with cyclophosphamide entered a brief remission, but still died more rapidly than did untreated, tumor-bearing mice ( Figure 6 I and unpublished data), apparently consequent to the toxicity described above. In summary, the response of the various model tumors varied consistently with the genotypes of the mice. B cell tumors that arose from the combined effects of MYC and antigen stimulus responded uniformly to three distinctive immunosuppressants, whereas only one of the three agents was effective against tumors elicited by MYC and a constitutive BCR (For data demonstrating the post-GC nature of antigen-stimulated tumors, see Figure S4 ). Since the E\u03bc- MYC tumors do not express BCR on their surface, they were presumably devoid of any apparent stimulus from the receptor, and were resistant to all the immunosuppressants tested. These results are in accord with two of our hypotheses: that tumorigenesis can be influenced by signals from the BCR, and that the signals generated by constitutive receptor may differ from those arising from an antigen-stimulated receptor (see Discussion ). We also explored whether the murine BL-like tumors were dependent on the continuous overexpression of MYC . To test this issue on established tumors, we allowed MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL mice to develop tumors in the absence of doxycycline.",

These values were compared to stains performed using a pan-specific antibody to IgM (Pharmingen Laboratories). This approach was used to determine the number of BCR HEL expressing cells in all the cases where the mice were on a C57/BL6 background, where the allotype expressed is normally IgM b . For the mice in which the genetic background was mixed (all the experiments that involved the MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC transgenes), the number of BCR HEL -expressing cells was determined by HEL binding. Single-cell suspensions were incubated with HEL (1 mg/ml, obtained from Sigma) in FACS buffer. These cells were washed and incubated with Hy9-biotin, an HEL-specific monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Jason Cyster, UCSF), followed by streptavidin-PE and B220-FITC (both obtained from Pharmingen Laboratories). The surface phenotype of cells present in the lymphoid organs of normal and tumor-bearing mice was analyzed by flow cytometry. Single cell suspensions were prepared from the lymph nodes, spleens, thymus, and bone marrow. The cell suspensions were incubated with 1:50 dilutions of antibodies on ice for 30 min, and were then washed in FACS buffer (1% BSA in PBS + 0.05% sodium azide) and fixed in PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde. Cells were stained with antibodies to one or more of the following markers: B220, Thy1.2, Mac-1, IgM (pan), IgM a , IgM b , IgD (pan) and IgD a , CD4, CD5, CD8, CD19, CD21, CD23, CD25, CD44, CD62L, CD69, CD80, and/or CD86 (all obtained from BD-Pharmingen). Binding of HEL to B cells was assessed by incubating cell suspensions with 1 mg/ml HEL (Sigma) in FACS buffer. The cells were then washed and incubated with Hy9-biotin, followed by Streptavidin-PE (BD-Pharmingen). To determine the clonal composition of the tumors, we adapted a protocol that has been described previously [ 97 ]. Genomic DNA was extracted from 10 6 cells (from either spleen or lymph nodes) using the Quiagen genomic DNA mini-kit (Quiagen), following the manufacturer's specifications. 200 ng of genomic DNA was used for a nested PCR reaction. The first reaction consisted of 5 \u03bcl of 10X Taq buffer (Gibco/Invitrogen), 4 \u03bcl of 50 mM MgCl 2 , 2.5 ng of V H -specific primer, 2.5 ng of J H- specific primer, 2.5 nM dNTPs (Roche Diagnostics) and 2.5 U of Taq polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) and distilled-deionized water to a final volume of 50 \u03bcl. The reactions were placed in a thermal cycler (MJ-Research) and subjected to a PCR cycle as previously described [ 97 ]. A sample of 2 \u03bcl from the first reaction was used as a template for the second reaction of the nested PCR. This reaction was conducted as the first one, except that the primer pairs encoded sequences within the initial set used earlier. The sequences for all the primers used have been previously described [ 96 ]. The PCR reaction products were fractionated in a 2% agarose/TAE gel, stained with ethidium bromide. Some of the PCR products were cloned using a TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen Laboratories), following manufacturer's specifications, then sequenced using the Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems), following manufacturer's specification, at the UCSF General Clinical Research Centers core facility. We used the Reynolds algorithm [ 98 ] and pSICO oligomaker software [ 35 ] in order to design the optimal target shRNA sequences. Those core 19-mer sequences were incorporated into the oligonucleotides designed to contain the stem and loop portions of the shRNA to be cloned into the vector pLL3.7 [ 36 ]. Cloning was performed as previously described [ 36 ]. The specific sequences we used to disrupt expression of murine Ig\u03b1, Ig\u03b2 or the control (firefly luciferase) have been described elsewhere [ 95 ]. All constructs presented here were initially validated for their ability to specifically knock down the expression levels of the protein of interest by transduction of two BCLs that we generated from the mouse models presented here. The two types of B cell lines we generated were derived from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL (DBL: d ouble transgenic B cell lymphoma) and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL (TBL: t riply transgenic B cell lymphoma) primary murine tumors. DBL and TBL cell lines were generated by passive selection from E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL and E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL primary murine tumors, respectively. Tumor B cell lines were grown in C10 (RPMI, 10% FBS (HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen) 100 units/ml penicillin G and streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 0.55 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen)). The GFP+ fraction of the transduced cell population was used for either Western blotting or flow cytometric analysis of protein expression. To generate infectious viral particles, we used 293FT cells as a packaging system that had been previously described [ 99 ]. 293FT cells were grown in D10 media (DMEM, 10% FBS (HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). 293FT cells grown to 60% confluency in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 5 \u03bcg pLL3.7, 3.3 \u03bcg pMDLg/pRRE, 1.3\u03bcg pRSV-REV, and 1.9\u03bcg pMD.G [ 99 ] overnight using calcium-phosphate methods, as described previously [ 36 ]. Media were replaced with 4.5 ml fresh D10 the following morning. Infections were performed as previously described [ 35 ]. Briefly, supernatants from 293FT cells were harvested 2 d after transfection and replaced with fresh D10. Viral supernatants were passed through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter and brought to a final concentration of 8 \u03bcg/ml polybrene and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. These supernatants were overlayed on 2 \u00d7 10 5 DBL and TBL cells and spun at 2,000 rpm for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C. Following spinfection, viral supernatants were removed and replaced with fresh C10. Infections were repeated the following day (3 d after transfection). For the in vitro assays used to determine whether the disruption of a gene product affected the competitiveness of a tumor cell, we used a mixed of transduced and nontransduced cells. The efficiency of viral transduction of DBL and TBL cell lines was initially evaluated 48 h after the second spin infection. We subsequently tracked infected cells for two weeks post-infection. For analysis, we normalized all infection efficiencies to the 48-h time point, and further normalized each day to the infection rate for the pLL3.7 alone. Groups of six mice were used for each of the experimental protocols. Four mice bearing transplanted tumors, and two age- and sex-matched wild-type mice were treated with the same drug and equal frequency. The transplant-recipient mice were held until tumors became clinically apparent (approximately 100 d for the E\u03bc- MYC tumors, 58 d for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL tumors, 21 d for the E\u03bc- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors, and 14 d for the MMTV-rtTA/TRE- MYC /BCR HEL /sHEL tumors). The mice then received daily injections of the indicated agents for 7 d. Mice were either euthanized 24 h after the last injection of drug, or held indefinitely to ascertain survival. Lymph nodes, spleens and bone marrows were collected and processed to generate single-cell suspensions. The cells were counted as described above. An aliquot from the cell suspensions was stained with antibodies for B220, Thy 1.2, Mac-1, IgM a , B7\u20132, and CD69, in order to determine the proportion of B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells, as well as the activation status of the HEL-reactive B cells. Treatments were performed with cyclosporin A (Bedford Laboratories) (2 mg/kg/day), FK506 (Prograf, Fujisawa Healthcare) (2 mg/kg/day), rapamycin (Biomol) (2 mg/kg/day), and cyclophosphamide (Bristol-Myers Squibb) (1 mg/kg/day). The therapeutic agents were suspended in PBS, sterilized by filtration through a 0.22\u03bcm membrane, and administered intravenously through the tail vein."
