Imbalance is not a new issue, as nursing shortages were reported in hospitals in the United States of America as early as 1915 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. It remains a major concern to this day, reported in both developed and developing countries and for most of the health care professions.</p><p>Although imbalance in the health workforce is an important issue for policy-makers, various elements contribute to obscuring policy development. First, many reports of shortages are not borne out by the evidence. Rosenfeld and Moses [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] show that an overwhelming majority of newspapers, journals and newsletter articles describing the nursing situation in the United States presume the existence of a shortage. They found that even in those areas where concrete evidence of a shortage was not available, the term \"nursing shortage\" still appeared. Second, the notion of shortage is a relative one: what is considered a nursing shortage in Europe would probably be viewed differently from an African perspective. Finally, imbalances are of different types and their impact on the health care system varies. In consequence, there is a general need to critically review the imbalance issue.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature and the development of an analytical framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition</title><p>There are various approaches to defining imbalances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. From an economic perspective, a skill imbalance (shortage/surplus) occurs when the quantity of a given skill supplied by the workforce and the quantity demanded by employers diverge at the existing market conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Labour market supplies and demands for occupational skills fluctuate continuously, so at times there will be imbalances in the labour market. In other words, a shortage/surplus is the result of a disequilibrium between the demand and supply for labour. In contrast, non-economic definitions are usually normative, i.e. there is a shortage of labour relative to defined norms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. In the case of health personnel, these definitions are based either on a value judgement &#x02013; for instance, how much care people should receive &#x02013; or on a professional determination &#x02013; such as deciding what is the appropriate number of physicians for the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature</title><p>One of the key questions regarding imbalances is how long these last: Is the imbalance temporary or permanent? In a competitive labour market, we should expect most imbalances to be resolved over time. Imbalances will tend to disappear faster the greater the reaction speed and also the greater the elasticity of supply (or demand) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. This type of imbalance (shortage or surplus) is defined as dynamic.</p><p>In contrast, a static imbalance occurs because supply does not increase or decrease; market equilibrium is therefore not achieved. For instance, wage adjustments may respond slowly to shifts in demand or supply as a result of institutional and regulatory arrangements, imperfect market competition (monopoly, monopsony) and wage-control policies. Another example is physicians' education: because of the length of time required to educate physicians, changes in available supply take a long time to react significantly. Lack of information on the state of the various labour markets can also be a factor in the speed of market adjustment. To make proper labour market decisions, households and firms must be informed of the existing market conditions across markets. They must therefore know what wages are paid and the nature and location of job openings and available workers.</p><p>Moreover, we should also differentiate between qualitative and quantitative imbalance. In a tight labour market, employers might not find the ideal candidate, but will still recruit someone. Under these conditions, the issue is the quality of job candidates rather than the quantity of people willing and able to do the job [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. From the employers' perspective, a shortage of workers exists; from the job-market perspective, the existence of a shortage could be questioned because the jobs are filled. One negative hidden impact of a qualitative shortage is the number of positions that are filled with ineffective individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A conceptual framework</title><p>To better understand the role of factors affecting health workforce imbalances and to facilitate the development of policy tools, a conceptual framework is presented in this section.</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Factors affecting health workforce imbalances are numerous and complex, but focusing on crucial elements should permit insight into the issue of health workforce imbalances. The framework is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> and contains six main components: the demand for health labour, the supply of health labour, the health care system, policies, resources and \"global\" factors.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Framework for imbalance of human resources for health</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-1\"/></fig><p>Central to this framework are the demand for and supply of health labour. Also included in the framework is the health care system, and in particular, some of its features that are likely to have an impact on health workforce imbalances. Policies constitute another crucial element of the framework. In effect, health policies but also non-health-oriented policies can have an impact on health workforce imbalances. The framework also incorporates financial, physical and knowledge resources that contribute to model the health workforce.Finally, \"global\" factors such as economic, sociodemographic, political, geographical and cultural factors are included. These elements contribute directly or indirectly to shaping and transforming the entire society and hence the health workforce.</p></sec><sec><title>The demand for health personnel</title><p>The first element of the framework to be examined is the demand for health personnel. The demand for health personnel can be considered as a derived demand for health services. Accordingly, we should consider factors determining the demand for health services. Personal characteristics &#x02013; such as health needs, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics &#x02013; and economic factors play an important role.</p><p>It has often been proposed that the planning of human resources for health be based solely on estimates of health needs in the population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. However, relying only on the concept of need is difficult, because it can be defined either broadly or restrictedly and accordingly lead to a perception of either systematic shortage or surplus. Health needs is only one of the factors affecting the demand for health personnel.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of economic factors on the demand for health care. In particular in the United States, studies have attempted to estimate price and income elasticities of demand for medical services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. Measurements of price or income elasticities make it possible to evaluate the impact of a change in price or income on the demand for health care. Most studies reported elasticities in the range between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating that consumers tend to be responsive to price changes but that the degree of price sensitivity is not very large compared to that for many other goods and services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>Another element influencing the demand for health care is the value of a patient's time, such as travel time and waiting time. Acton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] found that in the United States, elasticity of demand with respect to travel time ranged between -0.6 and -1, meaning that a 10% increase in travel time would induce a reduction of 6%-10% in the demand for health care.</p><p>Other factors affect the demand for health labour. In particular, some specific features of the health care system and its features, policies, resources and environmental factors do have an impact on the demand for health labour. Their respective role will further discussed later.</p></sec><sec><title>The supply of human resources for health</title><p>After reviewing factors affecting the demand for health labour, we shall now turn to those affecting the supply of the health workforce. In particular, we shall consider the following elements: factors affecting the choice for a health professional training/education, participation in the health labour market and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Education/professional training choice</title><p>The availability of a renewed health workforce, as well as the type of profession and specialty chosen by individuals, is a major concern for health decision-makers. These issues are of particular relevance, especially since the number of younger people, predominantly women, choosing a nursing career is declining in some countries and since in professional training/education, individuals' choices do not always match the absorptive capacity of the market.</p><p>From an economic perspective, the decision to undertake professional training/education is considered an investment decision. To emphasize the essential similarities of these investments to other kinds of investments, economists refer to them as investment in human capital [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. Since investment decisions usually deliver payoffs over time, we must consider the entire stream of costs and benefits. The expected returns on human capital investments are a higher level of earnings, greater job satisfaction over one's lifetime and a greater appreciation of non-market activities and interests.</p><p>Based on the human capital approach, rate of return on education can be estimated. An average rate of return that is high and rising for a given profession will attract more individuals to that profession. On the other hand, a lower and decreasing average rate of return will discourage individuals from choosing that profession. Nowak and Preston [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], using the human capital approach, found that Australian nurses are poorly paid in comparison to other female professionals. The declining interest in nursing can be partly explained by the expansion of career opportunities in traditionally male-dominated occupations over the last three decades that entail a higher rate of return [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The number of young women entering the registered-nurse workforce has declined because many women who would have entered nursing in the past &#x02013; particularly those with high academic ability &#x02013; are now entering managerial and professional occupations that used to be traditionally male.</p><p>Besides the human capital approach, the choice of a profession can also be explained by sociopsychological factors. For instance, individuals may choose a profession because it is highly valued by the society or for family tradition. In the health sector, the satisfaction afforded by caring for people and assisting them to improve their health is an important element used by nursing schools to attract new enrollees. In the light of this approach, the decline in the number of individuals choosing nursing as a career might also be explained by the fact that this profession is now less socially valued than before [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participation in the labour market</title><p>The economic theory of the decision to work views the decision as a choice concerning how people spend their time. Individuals face a trade-off between labour and leisure. They decide how much of their time to spend working for pay or participating in leisure activities, the latter being activities that are not work-related.</p><p>An issue that has drawn a lot of attention recently is the impact of wage increases on labour participation, in particular for nurses. In the short term, higher wages can have at least two effects on the labour supply of current qualified nurses: first, qualified nurses who are working in other occupations may return to nursing activities; second, nurses now in practice may respond by working more hours. In the long run, higher wages in nursing relative to other occupations make nursing an attractive profession and will draw more people into nurse training programmes.</p><p>In their literature review of wage elasticity of nursing labour supply, Antonazzo et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] and Chiha and Link [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] found that most of the studies indicate a positive relationship, although not a strong one, between wages and labour supply. Accordingly, increases in nursing wages are unlikely to cause significant increases in labour participation. A literature review on the women's workforce undertaken by Killingsworth and Heckman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] indicated that in addition to wage rate, women's participation is responsive to changes in unearned income, spouse's wage and having children (particularly of pre-school age). Another aspect of labour supply decisions that has been investigated by Philips [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] is the costs associated with entering the nursing labour market (such as costs of child care and housework). The elasticity of participation with respect to changes in working costs was evaluated at -0.67 for all nurses. This suggests that a subsidy leading to a decrease of 10% in these costs would increase the participation of nurses by 6.7%.</p><p>Moreover, hospitals are also using a variety of strategies to recruit new staff. A survey of hospitals in the United States shows that richer benefits, such as health insurance and vacation time, are the most common incentives used. In addition, hospitals may offer other recruitment and retention benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, flexible hours and signing bonuses based on experience or length of commitment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. Many countries, but particularly developed ones, use such incentives to recruit new staff.</p><p>Economic factors also play a role in physician's participation in the labour market, as demonstrated by the impact of cost-containment policies in Canada, where most provincial governments have implemented an assortment of controls of health care expenses. Threshold reductions were introduced, so that fees payable to individual physicians were reduced as billing exceeded an agreed threshold. As a consequence, physicians who had billed at the threshold level chose to take leaves of absence rather than receive a level of reimbursement they considered inadequate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>].</p><p>When health personnel choose an alternative or additional occupation, this is likely to have consequences on health labour supply. In developing countries, and particularly in Africa, attempts to reform the health care sector have frequently failed to respond to the aspirations of staff concerning remuneration and working conditions. Salaries are often inadequate and may be paid late, and health workers try to solve their financial problems in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Private practice is only one of the many survival strategies that health personnel use to supplement their income and increase their job satisfaction. Teaching, attending training courses, supervision activities, research, trade and agriculture are some of these alternative strategies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Labour market exit</title><p>Parker and Rickam [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] examined the economic determinants of the labour force withdrawal of registered nurses in the United States, i.e. nurses leaving the profession to pursue a non-nursing occupation and employed nurses withdrawing from the labour force. Their results suggest that a significant number of registered nurses withdraw, at least temporarily, from the labour force. Among the significant elements influencing the withdrawal decision are the wage rate, other family income, presence of children and full-time/part-time work status. Increasing registered nurses' wages and working full-time is expected to reduce the probability of labour force withdrawal, whereas higher education levels, age and other family income increase the probability of labour force withdrawal.</p><p>The relative importance of wage is also emphasized by studies investigating job satisfaction. There is support in the empirical literature for the existence of job dissatisfaction among nurses, and the link between job dissatisfaction and job exit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]. In the United States the most important factors in nurses' resignation were, in order of importance: workload, staffing, time with patients, flexible scheduling, respect from nursing administration, increasing nursing knowledge, promotion opportunities, work stimulation, salary and decision-making. These studies suggest that salary is just one of the reasons why nurses are quitting. The relative importance of wage is confirmed by Shields and Ward [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]. Their results suggest that dissatisfaction with promotion and training opportunities has a stronger impact than workload or pay.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration</title><p>Migration of health personnel can have a serious impact on the supply of human resources in health, because it may exacerbate health personnel imbalances in \"sending\" countries. It is suggested that migration is an \"individual, spontaneous and voluntary act\" that is motivated by the perceived net gain of migrating &#x02013; that is, the gain will offset the tangible and intangible costs of moving [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Decisions to migrate are often a family strategy to produce a better income and improve survival chances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>The reality for many health workers in developing countries is to be underpaid, poorly motivated and increasingly dissatisfied and sceptical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. The relevance of motivation to migration is self-evident. There can be little doubt that for many health workers an improvement in pay and conditions will act as an incentive to stay in the country. Improved pensions, child care, educational opportunities and recognition are also known to be important [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. In Ghana it is estimated that only 191 of the 489 doctors who graduated between 1985 and 1994 were still working in the country in 1997 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Health system characteristics</title><p>As the health workforce is part of the health care system, we shall also consider features of the health care system that are likely to have an impact on the demand and supply of health labour. In particular, we shall examine market failures, the diversity of stakeholders, the supply-demand adjustment time lag and hospitals' potential monopsony power.</p></sec><sec><title>Market failures</title><p>From an economic perspective, the health care market is characterized by market failures &#x02013; that is, the assumptions for perfect competition are violated. From a societal perspective, in the presence of market failures such as externalities &#x02013; imperfect knowledge, asymmetry of information and uncertainty &#x02013; market mechanisms lead to a non-optimal demand and/or supply in health services. In other words, shortages and surpluses are likely to result from the health care market.</p><p>Most markets are characterized by market failures, but what is unique to the health services market is the extent of these market failures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Governments try to correct health care market failures through policy interventions. A classic example of public intervention in the presence of a positive externality is the introduction of a policy of mandatory vaccination. However, implementing such policies is sometimes difficult and may result in only partial correction of the market failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Stakeholders</title><p>The health care system is characterized by a wide range of institutional stakeholders involved in shaping human resources for health, all of whom may have different objectives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. The objectives of a union or professional association do not necessarily coincide, for example, with those of a government ministry, a hospital manager or the central government. Unions/professional associations seek to increase their members' market power, employment and income [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], whereas the ministry of finance will want more budget equilibrium and will favour measures to limit health care expenditures.</p><p>In the case of Mozambique, whereas the policy of employing national professionals by cooperation agencies has met with warm support from national cadres, its effect on the health sector is problematic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. The prospect of immediate financial gains puts pressure on qualified professionals to leave their posts within the Mozambique National Health Service to take up management or consultant positions. The substantial investment in their training is therefore producing dubious direct returns to the National Health Service. More seriously perhaps, the presence of donor-paid jobs outside the health sector (as programme coordinators, researchers, etc.) is creating pressure on the Ministry of Health itself, exacerbating the imbalances in the National Health Service and creating incentives for trained Mozambicans to leave the public sector.</p></sec><sec><title>Time lag</title><p>Moreover, adjustments between the demand and supply for health personnel may take a long time. In the health care field; the time lag between education and practising may be quite substantial. To obtain licensure to practise medicine requires lengthy education and training, and the long lag time between a changed student intake and a change in supply has been noted [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]: supply adjustment for physicians is not immediate, but takes a long time.</p></sec><sec><title>Hospitals' potential monopsony power</title><p>A single entity that is the sole purchaser of labour is a <italic>monopsony</italic>. One example is the potential monopsony power of hospitals in hiring nurses or the ministry of health in hiring the health workforce. The amount of labour demanded will influence the price the monopsonist must pay for it. In contrast to the situation in a competitive market, the monopsony is a price maker, not a price taker. Monopsony results in lower wages and lower employment of nurses compared to a competitive market.</p><p>A number of studies have tested whether or not hospitals possess monopsony power with respect to nurses, and the results are contradictory. Sullivan [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>] and Staiger et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>] concluded that hospitals have a substantial degree of monopsony power. In contrast, Hirsch and Schumacher [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>] did not find empirical support for the monopsony model. Nurses' wages were found not to be related to hospital density and to decrease rather than increase with respect to labour market size.</p></sec><sec><title>Provider power/monopoly</title><p>In contrast, providers' power may enable the latter to restrict the supply of human resources for health. Seldon, Jung and Cavazos [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such avenues as restricting supply and price-fixing. In France, trade unions are granted an institutional role at establishment level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. In India and Sri Lanka, a clear constraint to support-services contracting was the inability to counter the power of the public service unions in dictating employment terms and conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. The varying degree of homogeneity of the different professional groups may also explain their relative success in maintaining a monopoly of practice. In Iceland, one of the factors that contributed to breaking the professional monopoly of pharmacists was division within the profession [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Regulations</title><p>The type off regulation associated with a profession plays an important role regarding the supply of members of a profession. Regulation has, by tradition, been achieved through a combination of direct government regulation and, to a large extent, through rules adopted by professional associations, whose self-regulatory powers enable them to establish both entry requirements and rules regarding professional conduct [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>].</p><p>Such barriers to entry exist in particular for doctors, but also in other health professions, such as dentistry. Some argue that these barriers constitute a means to limit entry into the profession, and hence maintain high incomes. Muzondo and Pazderka [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] established, for Canadian professional licensing restrictions, a relationship between different variables of self-regulation and higher income. Seldon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such sources as restricting supply and price-fixing. However, the proponents of self-regulation claim that these barriers are a means to provide health care of quality and to protect patients from incompetent providers. In contrast, although most countries have a professional nursing association, nurses tend to have limited power to regulate entry to the profession. This could be associated with a large diversity of specialist groups in nursing failing to unite on issues related to professional regulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Health and non-health policies</title><p>Health and non-health policies contribute to shaping the health care system and have an influence on the demand and supply of health labour.</p><p>Health policy can be defined as a formal statement or procedure within institutions (notably government) that defines priorities and the parameters for action in response to health needs, available resources and other political pressures. Health policy is often enacted through legislation or other forms of rule-making that create regulations and incentives for providing health services and programmes and access to them. For instance, the decision to introduce or expand health insurance coverage is likely to have an impact on the demand for health services. This is illustrated by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, a controlled experiment that increased knowledge about the effect of different insurance copayments on use of medical services. Insurance copayments ranged from zero to 95%. The RAND study concluded that as the co-insurance rose, overall use and expenditure fell for adults and children combined [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>].</p><p>Non-health policies reflect state interventions in areas such as employment, education and regional development that contribute to shaping the health workforce. These policies do not directly address health issues, but have an indirect impact on such issues. In France, a controversial new regulation was introduced that reduced the workweek to a maximum of 35 hours in an attempt both to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and to achieve greater flexibility in the labour force. Unions responded by demanding the creation of more posts in public hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial, physical and knowledge resources</title><p>Financial, physical and knowledge resources are crucial to any type of health care workforce. The level of resources attributed to the health care system, and how these resources are used, will have a significant impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>In terms of financial resources, human resources account for a high proportion of national budgets assigned to the health sector [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Health expenditure claims an increasingly important share of the gross domestic product and, in most countries, wage costs (salaries, bonuses and other payments) are estimated to account for between 65% and 80% of the renewable health system expenditure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>].</p><p>Physical resources include human resources within the health sector and other sectors; buildings and engineering services such as sanitation, water and heating systems for community use and for the use of medical care institutions; and equipment and supplies. Finally, the health workforce is also constrained by its human capital. This human capital can be associated with the qualification and education of the health workforce. Education of the health workforce is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given in preparation for work.</p></sec><sec><title>Global factors</title><p>Economic, sociodemographic, cultural, and geographical factors contribute to shaping and transforming society and hence have a direct or indirect impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>From an economic perspective, for instance, there is evidence of a correlation between the level of economic development of a country and its level of human resources for health. Countries with higher GDP per capita are said to spend more on health care than countries with lower income, as demonstrated by cross-sectional studies, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>] and hence would also tend to have larger health workforces.</p><p>Moreover, both the demand and supply are likely to be affected by sociodemographic elements such as the age distribution of the population. On the demand side, the ageing of the population is giving rise to an increase in the demand for health services and health personnel, especially nurses for home care.</p><p>On the supply side, the ageing of the health workforce, and in particular of nurses, has serious implications for the future of the nursing labour market. For example, the Institute of Medicine noted that older registered nurses have a reduced capacity to perform certain tasks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. It was found that between 1983 and 1998 the average age of practising registered nurses increased by more than four years, from 37.4 to 41.9 years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. In contrast, the average age of the United States workforce as a whole increased by less than two years during the same period. Furthermore, the proportion of the registered-nurse workforce younger than 30 years decreased from 30.3% to 12.1% during this period.</p><p>Geographical and cultural factors also play a role in determining the demand and supply of human resources. Geographical characteristics affect the organization of health services delivery. For instance, a country with many islands or with isolated population groups will face particular challenges in terms of health workforce issues. Similarly, significant climatic changes are likely to give rise to changes in health needs, which in turn will call for changes in health services and in the health workforce. Finally, both cultural and political values also affect the demand for and supply of human resources for health.</p></sec><sec><title>Health workforce imbalances: a typology</title><p>This section considers a typology of imbalances, and differentiates between the following:</p><p>&#x02022; Profession/specialty imbalances: Under this category, we consider imbalance in the various health professions, such as doctors or nurses, as well as shortages within a profession, e.g. shortage of one type of specialists.</p><p>&#x02022; Geographical imbalances: These are disparities between urban and rural regions and poor and rich regions.</p><p>&#x02022; Institutional and services imbalances: These are differences in health workforce supply between health care facilities, as well as between services.</p><p>&#x02022; Gender imbalances: These are disparities in female/male representation in the health workforce.</p><sec><title>Profession/specialty imbalances</title><p>Imbalances have been reported for almost all health professions, and in particular for nurses. The United States General Accounting Office [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>] reports a nursing shortage. However, the nursing shortage has not been institution-wide but is concentrated in specialty care areas, particularly intensive care units and operating rooms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The shortage of registered nurses in intensive care units is explained in part by the sharp decline in the number of younger registered nurses, whom intensive care units have historically attracted. Shortages in operating rooms probably reflect that many registered nurses who work in this setting are reaching the age when they are beginning to reduce their hours worked or are retiring altogether.</p><p>Major variations occur in the number of health care workers per capita population and in the skill mix employed across countries, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor ratio varies widely from one country to another, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor skill mix is important and may have consequences for the respective tasks of nurses and doctors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that these variations are taking place among countries with a relatively similar economic development level.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of physicians, nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists in selected countries. WHO data, 2000.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-2\"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Geographical imbalances</title><p>Virtually all countries suffer from a geographical maldistribution of human resources for health, and the primary area of concern is usually the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In both industrialized and developing countries, urban areas almost invariably have a substantially higher concentration of physicians than rural areas.</p><p>Understandably, most health care professionals prefer to settle in urban areas, which offer opportunities for professional development as well as education and other amenities for themselves and their families. But it is in the rural and remote areas, especially in the developing countries, that most severe public health problems are found.</p><p>The geographical maldistribution of doctors has been the object of particular attention. In general there is a higher concentration of general practitioners in the inner suburbs of the metropolitan areas. According to the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>], the reasons for high concentration of general practitioners in inner city areas are:</p><p>&#x02022; historical</p><p>&#x02022; lifestyle-related: access to amenities</p><p>&#x02022; spouse/husband-related: greater employment opportunities</p><p>&#x02022; child-related: better access to secondary and tertiary education services</p><p>&#x02022; professional, family and social ties and professional ambitions.</p><p>The geographical distribution of health care personnel is an important issue in many countries. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, contains one-fifth of the country's population but around half of the available health personnel [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>]. In Bangladesh, most of the doctors (35%) and nurses (30%) in health services are located in four metropolitan districts where only 14.5% of the population lives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B70\">70</xref>]. This concentration pattern is characteristic of developing countries.</p><p>In Indonesia the geographical distribution of physicians is a particular concern, since Indonesia's vast size and difficult geography present a tremendous challenge to health service delivery [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B71\">71</xref>]. It is difficult to place doctors in remote islands or mountain or forest locations with few amenities, no opportunities for private practice, and poor communications with the rest of the country.</p><p>To improve the geographical distribution of physicians, governments often have used combinations of compulsory service and incentives. So far, there is virtually no country in the world that has solved the problem of a rural/urban imbalance of the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. This does not necessarily mean that policies and programmes designed to reduce the imbalance have had no effect. For example, Thailand has successfully begun to stem the migration of health professionals from rural to urban areas and from public to private facilities with a range of strong financial incentives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B72\">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Institutional and services imbalances</title><p>Institutional imbalances occur when some health care facilities have too many staff because of prestige, working conditions, ability to generate additional income, or other situation-specific factors, while others are understaffed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B73\">73</xref>]. Institutions such as magnet hospitals, for example, are hospitals characterized by adequate to excellent staffing, low turnover, rich nursing skill mix and greater job satisfaction, among other factors, even in the face of a general health personnel shortage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B74\">74</xref>].</p><p>Imbalance between the types of health services provided may also arise. In particular, we can consider the issue of curative versus preventive care. In effect, it has been estimated that most diseases (80%) and accidents are preventable through known methodologies, yet at present there is an imbalance in the funding of medical research, with only 1%-2% going to prevention and 98%-99% spent on curative approaches [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B75\">75</xref>]. This imbalance in funding raises the question of a health workforce imbalance between preventive and curative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Gender imbalances</title><p>In many countries, women still tend to concentrate in the lower-status health occupations and to be a minority among more highly trained professionals and managers. In Bangladesh, the distribution by gender of the health workforce shows that the total proportion of women accounts for little more than one-fifth in health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>]. The distribution of women by occupational category is biased in favour of nurses. Women are very poorly represented in other categories, such as dentists, medical assistants, pharmacists, managers/trainers and doctors. The underrepresentation of women in managerial and decision-making positions may lead to less attention to and poorer understanding of the problems specific to women and the particularities of their utilization patterns [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B77\">77</xref>].</p><p>Female general practitioners have been shown to practise differently from males, managing different types of medical conditions, with some differences due to patient mix and patient selectivity, and others inherent in the sex of physician. In some more traditional areas, some women will not seek care for themselves or even for their children because they do not have access to a female provider [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This framework can be used to assess policy reforms and their impact on health workforce imbalances; it also provides a common framework for cross-country comparisons. This framework emphasizes the number and type of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, illustrating the complexity of this issue. From a policy perspective, it is particularly interesting to identify factors that policy-makers can influence in order to remedy imbalance problems.</p><p>Various monetary and non-monetary incentives are used to influence the supply and/or demand for the health workforce. For example, subsidies, grants and scholarships are examples of incentives that can be used to attract more nursing students, whereas wage increases, additional benefits and working hours flexibility are examples of commonly used incentives to attract or retain the health workforce.</p><p>The numerous factors and actors involved in the health workforce imbalance issue call for a coherent health workforce vision and policy. In that context, health planning plays an important role since it contributes to shaping the health care system. Moreover, since from a societal perspective market mechanisms alone do not allow an adequate demand/supply of health personnel to be reached, public interventions such as human resources planning are a means to correct for market failures. Health planning involves a time horizon. Forecasting the future number of health personnel needed and developing policies to meet such figures are common to any health care system. Physicians represent the profession for which more planning effort has been expended to achieve a workforce of appropriate size than for any other health profession. Countries' desire to meet population health needs and to avoid social welfare losses resulting from a shortage or an oversupply are factors explaining, to a large extent, the importance attributed to planning in the context of public health policies.</p><p>The policy implications of forecasting either a shortage or a surplus of health care personnel are different, and hence attempts at projections must be rigorous. For instance, referring to previous studies predicting significant surpluses, Cooper [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B78\">78</xref>] notes that such large surpluses have not occurred so far, because of a decrease in physician work effort. Factors such as age, sex and lifestyle contributed to this evolution.</p><p>As a result of forecasted physician surpluses, various policy recommendations have been formulated. The United States Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B79\">79</xref>] published a report recommending, among other things, that there be no new medical schools, that existing schools should not increase their class size and that the number of first-year residency positions should be reduced. The Pew Health Professions Commission Report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B80\">80</xref>] issued a report recommending more severe steps, such as the closing of some medical schools and tightening the visa process for international medical graduates.</p><p>This framework also apprehends the different types of imbalances. This is important since the choice of a policy will also depend on the type of imbalance. Significant disparities in human resources for health between health occupation, regions, gender or health services are recognized as classic problems of imbalance. However, the question of a public/private imbalance is more debatable. One the one hand, we can argue that for equity and access, a health care system should have a strong public component. On the other hand, we can imagine a private-sector oriented health care system with mechanisms to ensure access to the poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of imbalances in the health workforce, this paper has discussed a framework for human resources for health and proposed a typology of imbalances. Although the term \"imbalance\" is commonly used with respect to the health workforce, it is clear that imbalance in the health workforce encompasses a wide range of possible situations and is a complex issue. The use of a framework should facilitate the development of policy tools and their assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'

It is a complex issue that encompasses a wide range of possible situations. This paper aims to contribute not only to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature, but also to the development of an analytical framework. The framework emphasizes the number and types of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, and facilitates the development of policy tools and their assessment. Moreover, to facilitate comparisons between health workforce imbalances, a typology of imbalances is proposed that differentiates between profession/specialty imbalances, geographical imbalances, institutional and services imbalances and gender imbalances.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Imbalance in the health workforce is a major challenge for health policy-makers, since human resources &#x02013; the different kinds of clinical and non-clinical staff who make each individual and public health intervention happen &#x02013; are the most important of the health system's inputs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. Imbalance is not a new issue, as nursing shortages were reported in hospitals in the United States of America as early as 1915 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. It remains a major concern to this day, reported in both developed and developing countries and for most of the health care professions.</p><p>Although imbalance in the health workforce is an important issue for policy-makers, various elements contribute to obscuring policy development. First, many reports of shortages are not borne out by the evidence. Rosenfeld and Moses [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] show that an overwhelming majority of newspapers, journals and newsletter articles describing the nursing situation in the United States presume the existence of a shortage. They found that even in those areas where concrete evidence of a shortage was not available, the term \"nursing shortage\" still appeared. Second, the notion of shortage is a relative one: what is considered a nursing shortage in Europe would probably be viewed differently from an African perspective. Finally, imbalances are of different types and their impact on the health care system varies. In consequence, there is a general need to critically review the imbalance issue.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature and the development of an analytical framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition</title><p>There are various approaches to defining imbalances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. From an economic perspective, a skill imbalance (shortage/surplus) occurs when the quantity of a given skill supplied by the workforce and the quantity demanded by employers diverge at the existing market conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Labour market supplies and demands for occupational skills fluctuate continuously, so at times there will be imbalances in the labour market. In other words, a shortage/surplus is the result of a disequilibrium between the demand and supply for labour. In contrast, non-economic definitions are usually normative, i.e. there is a shortage of labour relative to defined norms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. In the case of health personnel, these definitions are based either on a value judgement &#x02013; for instance, how much care people should receive &#x02013; or on a professional determination &#x02013; such as deciding what is the appropriate number of physicians for the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature</title><p>One of the key questions regarding imbalances is how long these last: Is the imbalance temporary or permanent? In a competitive labour market, we should expect most imbalances to be resolved over time. Imbalances will tend to disappear faster the greater the reaction speed and also the greater the elasticity of supply (or demand) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. This type of imbalance (shortage or surplus) is defined as dynamic.</p><p>In contrast, a static imbalance occurs because supply does not increase or decrease; market equilibrium is therefore not achieved. For instance, wage adjustments may respond slowly to shifts in demand or supply as a result of institutional and regulatory arrangements, imperfect market competition (monopoly, monopsony) and wage-control policies. Another example is physicians' education: because of the length of time required to educate physicians, changes in available supply take a long time to react significantly. Lack of information on the state of the various labour markets can also be a factor in the speed of market adjustment. To make proper labour market decisions, households and firms must be informed of the existing market conditions across markets. They must therefore know what wages are paid and the nature and location of job openings and available workers.</p><p>Moreover, we should also differentiate between qualitative and quantitative imbalance. In a tight labour market, employers might not find the ideal candidate, but will still recruit someone. Under these conditions, the issue is the quality of job candidates rather than the quantity of people willing and able to do the job [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. From the employers' perspective, a shortage of workers exists; from the job-market perspective, the existence of a shortage could be questioned because the jobs are filled. One negative hidden impact of a qualitative shortage is the number of positions that are filled with ineffective individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A conceptual framework</title><p>To better understand the role of factors affecting health workforce imbalances and to facilitate the development of policy tools, a conceptual framework is presented in this section.</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Factors affecting health workforce imbalances are numerous and complex, but focusing on crucial elements should permit insight into the issue of health workforce imbalances. The framework is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> and contains six main components: the demand for health labour, the supply of health labour, the health care system, policies, resources and \"global\" factors.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Framework for imbalance of human resources for health</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-1\"/></fig><p>Central to this framework are the demand for and supply of health labour. Also included in the framework is the health care system, and in particular, some of its features that are likely to have an impact on health workforce imbalances. Policies constitute another crucial element of the framework. In effect, health policies but also non-health-oriented policies can have an impact on health workforce imbalances. The framework also incorporates financial, physical and knowledge resources that contribute to model the health workforce.Finally, \"global\" factors such as economic, sociodemographic, political, geographical and cultural factors are included. These elements contribute directly or indirectly to shaping and transforming the entire society and hence the health workforce.</p></sec><sec><title>The demand for health personnel</title><p>The first element of the framework to be examined is the demand for health personnel. The demand for health personnel can be considered as a derived demand for health services. Accordingly, we should consider factors determining the demand for health services. Personal characteristics &#x02013; such as health needs, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics &#x02013; and economic factors play an important role.</p><p>It has often been proposed that the planning of human resources for health be based solely on estimates of health needs in the population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. However, relying only on the concept of need is difficult, because it can be defined either broadly or restrictedly and accordingly lead to a perception of either systematic shortage or surplus. Health needs is only one of the factors affecting the demand for health personnel.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of economic factors on the demand for health care. In particular in the United States, studies have attempted to estimate price and income elasticities of demand for medical services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. Measurements of price or income elasticities make it possible to evaluate the impact of a change in price or income on the demand for health care. Most studies reported elasticities in the range between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating that consumers tend to be responsive to price changes but that the degree of price sensitivity is not very large compared to that for many other goods and services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>Another element influencing the demand for health care is the value of a patient's time, such as travel time and waiting time. Acton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] found that in the United States, elasticity of demand with respect to travel time ranged between -0.6 and -1, meaning that a 10% increase in travel time would induce a reduction of 6%-10% in the demand for health care.</p><p>Other factors affect the demand for health labour. In particular, some specific features of the health care system and its features, policies, resources and environmental factors do have an impact on the demand for health labour. Their respective role will further discussed later.</p></sec><sec><title>The supply of human resources for health</title><p>After reviewing factors affecting the demand for health labour, we shall now turn to those affecting the supply of the health workforce. In particular, we shall consider the following elements: factors affecting the choice for a health professional training/education, participation in the health labour market and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Education/professional training choice</title><p>The availability of a renewed health workforce, as well as the type of profession and specialty chosen by individuals, is a major concern for health decision-makers. These issues are of particular relevance, especially since the number of younger people, predominantly women, choosing a nursing career is declining in some countries and since in professional training/education, individuals' choices do not always match the absorptive capacity of the market.</p><p>From an economic perspective, the decision to undertake professional training/education is considered an investment decision. To emphasize the essential similarities of these investments to other kinds of investments, economists refer to them as investment in human capital [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. Since investment decisions usually deliver payoffs over time, we must consider the entire stream of costs and benefits. The expected returns on human capital investments are a higher level of earnings, greater job satisfaction over one's lifetime and a greater appreciation of non-market activities and interests.</p><p>Based on the human capital approach, rate of return on education can be estimated. An average rate of return that is high and rising for a given profession will attract more individuals to that profession. On the other hand, a lower and decreasing average rate of return will discourage individuals from choosing that profession. Nowak and Preston [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], using the human capital approach, found that Australian nurses are poorly paid in comparison to other female professionals. The declining interest in nursing can be partly explained by the expansion of career opportunities in traditionally male-dominated occupations over the last three decades that entail a higher rate of return [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The number of young women entering the registered-nurse workforce has declined because many women who would have entered nursing in the past &#x02013; particularly those with high academic ability &#x02013; are now entering managerial and professional occupations that used to be traditionally male.</p><p>Besides the human capital approach, the choice of a profession can also be explained by sociopsychological factors. For instance, individuals may choose a profession because it is highly valued by the society or for family tradition. In the health sector, the satisfaction afforded by caring for people and assisting them to improve their health is an important element used by nursing schools to attract new enrollees. In the light of this approach, the decline in the number of individuals choosing nursing as a career might also be explained by the fact that this profession is now less socially valued than before [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participation in the labour market</title><p>The economic theory of the decision to work views the decision as a choice concerning how people spend their time. Individuals face a trade-off between labour and leisure. They decide how much of their time to spend working for pay or participating in leisure activities, the latter being activities that are not work-related.</p><p>An issue that has drawn a lot of attention recently is the impact of wage increases on labour participation, in particular for nurses. In the short term, higher wages can have at least two effects on the labour supply of current qualified nurses: first, qualified nurses who are working in other occupations may return to nursing activities; second, nurses now in practice may respond by working more hours. In the long run, higher wages in nursing relative to other occupations make nursing an attractive profession and will draw more people into nurse training programmes.</p><p>In their literature review of wage elasticity of nursing labour supply, Antonazzo et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] and Chiha and Link [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] found that most of the studies indicate a positive relationship, although not a strong one, between wages and labour supply. Accordingly, increases in nursing wages are unlikely to cause significant increases in labour participation. A literature review on the women's workforce undertaken by Killingsworth and Heckman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] indicated that in addition to wage rate, women's participation is responsive to changes in unearned income, spouse's wage and having children (particularly of pre-school age). Another aspect of labour supply decisions that has been investigated by Philips [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] is the costs associated with entering the nursing labour market (such as costs of child care and housework). The elasticity of participation with respect to changes in working costs was evaluated at -0.67 for all nurses. This suggests that a subsidy leading to a decrease of 10% in these costs would increase the participation of nurses by 6.7%.</p><p>Moreover, hospitals are also using a variety of strategies to recruit new staff. A survey of hospitals in the United States shows that richer benefits, such as health insurance and vacation time, are the most common incentives used. In addition, hospitals may offer other recruitment and retention benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, flexible hours and signing bonuses based on experience or length of commitment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. Many countries, but particularly developed ones, use such incentives to recruit new staff.</p><p>Economic factors also play a role in physician's participation in the labour market, as demonstrated by the impact of cost-containment policies in Canada, where most provincial governments have implemented an assortment of controls of health care expenses. Threshold reductions were introduced, so that fees payable to individual physicians were reduced as billing exceeded an agreed threshold. As a consequence, physicians who had billed at the threshold level chose to take leaves of absence rather than receive a level of reimbursement they considered inadequate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>].</p><p>When health personnel choose an alternative or additional occupation, this is likely to have consequences on health labour supply. In developing countries, and particularly in Africa, attempts to reform the health care sector have frequently failed to respond to the aspirations of staff concerning remuneration and working conditions. Salaries are often inadequate and may be paid late, and health workers try to solve their financial problems in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Private practice is only one of the many survival strategies that health personnel use to supplement their income and increase their job satisfaction. Teaching, attending training courses, supervision activities, research, trade and agriculture are some of these alternative strategies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Labour market exit</title><p>Parker and Rickam [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] examined the economic determinants of the labour force withdrawal of registered nurses in the United States, i.e. nurses leaving the profession to pursue a non-nursing occupation and employed nurses withdrawing from the labour force. Their results suggest that a significant number of registered nurses withdraw, at least temporarily, from the labour force. Among the significant elements influencing the withdrawal decision are the wage rate, other family income, presence of children and full-time/part-time work status. Increasing registered nurses' wages and working full-time is expected to reduce the probability of labour force withdrawal, whereas higher education levels, age and other family income increase the probability of labour force withdrawal.</p><p>The relative importance of wage is also emphasized by studies investigating job satisfaction. There is support in the empirical literature for the existence of job dissatisfaction among nurses, and the link between job dissatisfaction and job exit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]. In the United States the most important factors in nurses' resignation were, in order of importance: workload, staffing, time with patients, flexible scheduling, respect from nursing administration, increasing nursing knowledge, promotion opportunities, work stimulation, salary and decision-making. These studies suggest that salary is just one of the reasons why nurses are quitting. The relative importance of wage is confirmed by Shields and Ward [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]. Their results suggest that dissatisfaction with promotion and training opportunities has a stronger impact than workload or pay.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration</title><p>Migration of health personnel can have a serious impact on the supply of human resources in health, because it may exacerbate health personnel imbalances in \"sending\" countries. It is suggested that migration is an \"individual, spontaneous and voluntary act\" that is motivated by the perceived net gain of migrating &#x02013; that is, the gain will offset the tangible and intangible costs of moving [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Decisions to migrate are often a family strategy to produce a better income and improve survival chances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>The reality for many health workers in developing countries is to be underpaid, poorly motivated and increasingly dissatisfied and sceptical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. The relevance of motivation to migration is self-evident. There can be little doubt that for many health workers an improvement in pay and conditions will act as an incentive to stay in the country. Improved pensions, child care, educational opportunities and recognition are also known to be important [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. In Ghana it is estimated that only 191 of the 489 doctors who graduated between 1985 and 1994 were still working in the country in 1997 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Health system characteristics</title><p>As the health workforce is part of the health care system, we shall also consider features of the health care system that are likely to have an impact on the demand and supply of health labour. In particular, we shall examine market failures, the diversity of stakeholders, the supply-demand adjustment time lag and hospitals' potential monopsony power.</p></sec><sec><title>Market failures</title><p>From an economic perspective, the health care market is characterized by market failures &#x02013; that is, the assumptions for perfect competition are violated. From a societal perspective, in the presence of market failures such as externalities &#x02013; imperfect knowledge, asymmetry of information and uncertainty &#x02013; market mechanisms lead to a non-optimal demand and/or supply in health services. In other words, shortages and surpluses are likely to result from the health care market.</p><p>Most markets are characterized by market failures, but what is unique to the health services market is the extent of these market failures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Governments try to correct health care market failures through policy interventions. A classic example of public intervention in the presence of a positive externality is the introduction of a policy of mandatory vaccination. However, implementing such policies is sometimes difficult and may result in only partial correction of the market failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Stakeholders</title><p>The health care system is characterized by a wide range of institutional stakeholders involved in shaping human resources for health, all of whom may have different objectives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. The objectives of a union or professional association do not necessarily coincide, for example, with those of a government ministry, a hospital manager or the central government. Unions/professional associations seek to increase their members' market power, employment and income [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], whereas the ministry of finance will want more budget equilibrium and will favour measures to limit health care expenditures.</p><p>In the case of Mozambique, whereas the policy of employing national professionals by cooperation agencies has met with warm support from national cadres, its effect on the health sector is problematic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. The prospect of immediate financial gains puts pressure on qualified professionals to leave their posts within the Mozambique National Health Service to take up management or consultant positions. The substantial investment in their training is therefore producing dubious direct returns to the National Health Service. More seriously perhaps, the presence of donor-paid jobs outside the health sector (as programme coordinators, researchers, etc.) is creating pressure on the Ministry of Health itself, exacerbating the imbalances in the National Health Service and creating incentives for trained Mozambicans to leave the public sector.</p></sec><sec><title>Time lag</title><p>Moreover, adjustments between the demand and supply for health personnel may take a long time. In the health care field; the time lag between education and practising may be quite substantial. To obtain licensure to practise medicine requires lengthy education and training, and the long lag time between a changed student intake and a change in supply has been noted [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]: supply adjustment for physicians is not immediate, but takes a long time.</p></sec><sec><title>Hospitals' potential monopsony power</title><p>A single entity that is the sole purchaser of labour is a <italic>monopsony</italic>. One example is the potential monopsony power of hospitals in hiring nurses or the ministry of health in hiring the health workforce. The amount of labour demanded will influence the price the monopsonist must pay for it. In contrast to the situation in a competitive market, the monopsony is a price maker, not a price taker. Monopsony results in lower wages and lower employment of nurses compared to a competitive market.</p><p>A number of studies have tested whether or not hospitals possess monopsony power with respect to nurses, and the results are contradictory. Sullivan [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>] and Staiger et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>] concluded that hospitals have a substantial degree of monopsony power. In contrast, Hirsch and Schumacher [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>] did not find empirical support for the monopsony model. Nurses' wages were found not to be related to hospital density and to decrease rather than increase with respect to labour market size.</p></sec><sec><title>Provider power/monopoly</title><p>In contrast, providers' power may enable the latter to restrict the supply of human resources for health. Seldon, Jung and Cavazos [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such avenues as restricting supply and price-fixing. In France, trade unions are granted an institutional role at establishment level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. In India and Sri Lanka, a clear constraint to support-services contracting was the inability to counter the power of the public service unions in dictating employment terms and conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. The varying degree of homogeneity of the different professional groups may also explain their relative success in maintaining a monopoly of practice. In Iceland, one of the factors that contributed to breaking the professional monopoly of pharmacists was division within the profession [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Regulations</title><p>The type off regulation associated with a profession plays an important role regarding the supply of members of a profession. Regulation has, by tradition, been achieved through a combination of direct government regulation and, to a large extent, through rules adopted by professional associations, whose self-regulatory powers enable them to establish both entry requirements and rules regarding professional conduct [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>].</p><p>Such barriers to entry exist in particular for doctors, but also in other health professions, such as dentistry. Some argue that these barriers constitute a means to limit entry into the profession, and hence maintain high incomes. Muzondo and Pazderka [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] established, for Canadian professional licensing restrictions, a relationship between different variables of self-regulation and higher income. Seldon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such sources as restricting supply and price-fixing. However, the proponents of self-regulation claim that these barriers are a means to provide health care of quality and to protect patients from incompetent providers. In contrast, although most countries have a professional nursing association, nurses tend to have limited power to regulate entry to the profession. This could be associated with a large diversity of specialist groups in nursing failing to unite on issues related to professional regulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Health and non-health policies</title><p>Health and non-health policies contribute to shaping the health care system and have an influence on the demand and supply of health labour.</p><p>Health policy can be defined as a formal statement or procedure within institutions (notably government) that defines priorities and the parameters for action in response to health needs, available resources and other political pressures. Health policy is often enacted through legislation or other forms of rule-making that create regulations and incentives for providing health services and programmes and access to them. For instance, the decision to introduce or expand health insurance coverage is likely to have an impact on the demand for health services. This is illustrated by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, a controlled experiment that increased knowledge about the effect of different insurance copayments on use of medical services. Insurance copayments ranged from zero to 95%. The RAND study concluded that as the co-insurance rose, overall use and expenditure fell for adults and children combined [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>].</p><p>Non-health policies reflect state interventions in areas such as employment, education and regional development that contribute to shaping the health workforce. These policies do not directly address health issues, but have an indirect impact on such issues. In France, a controversial new regulation was introduced that reduced the workweek to a maximum of 35 hours in an attempt both to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and to achieve greater flexibility in the labour force. Unions responded by demanding the creation of more posts in public hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial, physical and knowledge resources</title><p>Financial, physical and knowledge resources are crucial to any type of health care workforce. The level of resources attributed to the health care system, and how these resources are used, will have a significant impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>In terms of financial resources, human resources account for a high proportion of national budgets assigned to the health sector [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Health expenditure claims an increasingly important share of the gross domestic product and, in most countries, wage costs (salaries, bonuses and other payments) are estimated to account for between 65% and 80% of the renewable health system expenditure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>].</p><p>Physical resources include human resources within the health sector and other sectors; buildings and engineering services such as sanitation, water and heating systems for community use and for the use of medical care institutions; and equipment and supplies. Finally, the health workforce is also constrained by its human capital. This human capital can be associated with the qualification and education of the health workforce. Education of the health workforce is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given in preparation for work.</p></sec><sec><title>Global factors</title><p>Economic, sociodemographic, cultural, and geographical factors contribute to shaping and transforming society and hence have a direct or indirect impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>From an economic perspective, for instance, there is evidence of a correlation between the level of economic development of a country and its level of human resources for health. Countries with higher GDP per capita are said to spend more on health care than countries with lower income, as demonstrated by cross-sectional studies, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>] and hence would also tend to have larger health workforces.</p><p>Moreover, both the demand and supply are likely to be affected by sociodemographic elements such as the age distribution of the population. On the demand side, the ageing of the population is giving rise to an increase in the demand for health services and health personnel, especially nurses for home care.</p><p>On the supply side, the ageing of the health workforce, and in particular of nurses, has serious implications for the future of the nursing labour market. For example, the Institute of Medicine noted that older registered nurses have a reduced capacity to perform certain tasks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. It was found that between 1983 and 1998 the average age of practising registered nurses increased by more than four years, from 37.4 to 41.9 years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. In contrast, the average age of the United States workforce as a whole increased by less than two years during the same period. Furthermore, the proportion of the registered-nurse workforce younger than 30 years decreased from 30.3% to 12.1% during this period.</p><p>Geographical and cultural factors also play a role in determining the demand and supply of human resources. Geographical characteristics affect the organization of health services delivery. For instance, a country with many islands or with isolated population groups will face particular challenges in terms of health workforce issues. Similarly, significant climatic changes are likely to give rise to changes in health needs, which in turn will call for changes in health services and in the health workforce. Finally, both cultural and political values also affect the demand for and supply of human resources for health.</p></sec><sec><title>Health workforce imbalances: a typology</title><p>This section considers a typology of imbalances, and differentiates between the following:</p><p>&#x02022; Profession/specialty imbalances: Under this category, we consider imbalance in the various health professions, such as doctors or nurses, as well as shortages within a profession, e.g. shortage of one type of specialists.</p><p>&#x02022; Geographical imbalances: These are disparities between urban and rural regions and poor and rich regions.</p><p>&#x02022; Institutional and services imbalances: These are differences in health workforce supply between health care facilities, as well as between services.</p><p>&#x02022; Gender imbalances: These are disparities in female/male representation in the health workforce.</p><sec><title>Profession/specialty imbalances</title><p>Imbalances have been reported for almost all health professions, and in particular for nurses. The United States General Accounting Office [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>] reports a nursing shortage. However, the nursing shortage has not been institution-wide but is concentrated in specialty care areas, particularly intensive care units and operating rooms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The shortage of registered nurses in intensive care units is explained in part by the sharp decline in the number of younger registered nurses, whom intensive care units have historically attracted. Shortages in operating rooms probably reflect that many registered nurses who work in this setting are reaching the age when they are beginning to reduce their hours worked or are retiring altogether.</p><p>Major variations occur in the number of health care workers per capita population and in the skill mix employed across countries, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor ratio varies widely from one country to another, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor skill mix is important and may have consequences for the respective tasks of nurses and doctors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that these variations are taking place among countries with a relatively similar economic development level.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of physicians, nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists in selected countries. WHO data, 2000.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-2\"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Geographical imbalances</title><p>Virtually all countries suffer from a geographical maldistribution of human resources for health, and the primary area of concern is usually the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In both industrialized and developing countries, urban areas almost invariably have a substantially higher concentration of physicians than rural areas.</p><p>Understandably, most health care professionals prefer to settle in urban areas, which offer opportunities for professional development as well as education and other amenities for themselves and their families. But it is in the rural and remote areas, especially in the developing countries, that most severe public health problems are found.</p><p>The geographical maldistribution of doctors has been the object of particular attention. In general there is a higher concentration of general practitioners in the inner suburbs of the metropolitan areas. According to the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>], the reasons for high concentration of general practitioners in inner city areas are:</p><p>&#x02022; historical</p><p>&#x02022; lifestyle-related: access to amenities</p><p>&#x02022; spouse/husband-related: greater employment opportunities</p><p>&#x02022; child-related: better access to secondary and tertiary education services</p><p>&#x02022; professional, family and social ties and professional ambitions.</p><p>The geographical distribution of health care personnel is an important issue in many countries. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, contains one-fifth of the country's population but around half of the available health personnel [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>]. In Bangladesh, most of the doctors (35%) and nurses (30%) in health services are located in four metropolitan districts where only 14.5% of the population lives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B70\">70</xref>]. This concentration pattern is characteristic of developing countries.</p><p>In Indonesia the geographical distribution of physicians is a particular concern, since Indonesia's vast size and difficult geography present a tremendous challenge to health service delivery [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B71\">71</xref>]. It is difficult to place doctors in remote islands or mountain or forest locations with few amenities, no opportunities for private practice, and poor communications with the rest of the country.</p><p>To improve the geographical distribution of physicians, governments often have used combinations of compulsory service and incentives. So far, there is virtually no country in the world that has solved the problem of a rural/urban imbalance of the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. This does not necessarily mean that policies and programmes designed to reduce the imbalance have had no effect. For example, Thailand has successfully begun to stem the migration of health professionals from rural to urban areas and from public to private facilities with a range of strong financial incentives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B72\">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Institutional and services imbalances</title><p>Institutional imbalances occur when some health care facilities have too many staff because of prestige, working conditions, ability to generate additional income, or other situation-specific factors, while others are understaffed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B73\">73</xref>]. Institutions such as magnet hospitals, for example, are hospitals characterized by adequate to excellent staffing, low turnover, rich nursing skill mix and greater job satisfaction, among other factors, even in the face of a general health personnel shortage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B74\">74</xref>].</p><p>Imbalance between the types of health services provided may also arise. In particular, we can consider the issue of curative versus preventive care. In effect, it has been estimated that most diseases (80%) and accidents are preventable through known methodologies, yet at present there is an imbalance in the funding of medical research, with only 1%-2% going to prevention and 98%-99% spent on curative approaches [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B75\">75</xref>]. This imbalance in funding raises the question of a health workforce imbalance between preventive and curative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Gender imbalances</title><p>In many countries, women still tend to concentrate in the lower-status health occupations and to be a minority among more highly trained professionals and managers. In Bangladesh, the distribution by gender of the health workforce shows that the total proportion of women accounts for little more than one-fifth in health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>]. The distribution of women by occupational category is biased in favour of nurses. Women are very poorly represented in other categories, such as dentists, medical assistants, pharmacists, managers/trainers and doctors. The underrepresentation of women in managerial and decision-making positions may lead to less attention to and poorer understanding of the problems specific to women and the particularities of their utilization patterns [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B77\">77</xref>].</p><p>Female general practitioners have been shown to practise differently from males, managing different types of medical conditions, with some differences due to patient mix and patient selectivity, and others inherent in the sex of physician. In some more traditional areas, some women will not seek care for themselves or even for their children because they do not have access to a female provider [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This framework can be used to assess policy reforms and their impact on health workforce imbalances; it also provides a common framework for cross-country comparisons. This framework emphasizes the number and type of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, illustrating the complexity of this issue. From a policy perspective, it is particularly interesting to identify factors that policy-makers can influence in order to remedy imbalance problems.</p><p>Various monetary and non-monetary incentives are used to influence the supply and/or demand for the health workforce. For example, subsidies, grants and scholarships are examples of incentives that can be used to attract more nursing students, whereas wage increases, additional benefits and working hours flexibility are examples of commonly used incentives to attract or retain the health workforce.</p><p>The numerous factors and actors involved in the health workforce imbalance issue call for a coherent health workforce vision and policy. In that context, health planning plays an important role since it contributes to shaping the health care system. Moreover, since from a societal perspective market mechanisms alone do not allow an adequate demand/supply of health personnel to be reached, public interventions such as human resources planning are a means to correct for market failures. Health planning involves a time horizon. Forecasting the future number of health personnel needed and developing policies to meet such figures are common to any health care system. Physicians represent the profession for which more planning effort has been expended to achieve a workforce of appropriate size than for any other health profession. Countries' desire to meet population health needs and to avoid social welfare losses resulting from a shortage or an oversupply are factors explaining, to a large extent, the importance attributed to planning in the context of public health policies.</p><p>The policy implications of forecasting either a shortage or a surplus of health care personnel are different, and hence attempts at projections must be rigorous. For instance, referring to previous studies predicting significant surpluses, Cooper [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B78\">78</xref>] notes that such large surpluses have not occurred so far, because of a decrease in physician work effort. Factors such as age, sex and lifestyle contributed to this evolution.</p><p>As a result of forecasted physician surpluses, various policy recommendations have been formulated. The United States Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B79\">79</xref>] published a report recommending, among other things, that there be no new medical schools, that existing schools should not increase their class size and that the number of first-year residency positions should be reduced. The Pew Health Professions Commission Report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B80\">80</xref>] issued a report recommending more severe steps, such as the closing of some medical schools and tightening the visa process for international medical graduates.</p><p>This framework also apprehends the different types of imbalances. This is important since the choice of a policy will also depend on the type of imbalance. Significant disparities in human resources for health between health occupation, regions, gender or health services are recognized as classic problems of imbalance. However, the question of a public/private imbalance is more debatable. One the one hand, we can argue that for equity and access, a health care system should have a strong public component. On the other hand, we can imagine a private-sector oriented health care system with mechanisms to ensure access to the poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of imbalances in the health workforce, this paper has discussed a framework for human resources for health and proposed a typology of imbalances. Although the term \"imbalance\" is commonly used with respect to the health workforce, it is clear that imbalance in the health workforce encompasses a wide range of possible situations and is a complex issue. The use of a framework should facilitate the development of policy tools and their assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'

It is a complex issue that encompasses a wide range of possible situations. This paper aims to contribute not only to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature, but also to the development of an analytical framework. The framework emphasizes the number and types of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, and facilitates the development of policy tools and their assessment. Moreover, to facilitate comparisons between health workforce imbalances, a typology of imbalances is proposed that differentiates between profession/specialty imbalances, geographical imbalances, institutional and services imbalances and gender imbalances.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Imbalance in the health workforce is a major challenge for health policy-makers, since human resources &#x02013; the different kinds of clinical and non-clinical staff who make each individual and public health intervention happen &#x02013; are the most important of the health system's inputs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. Imbalance is not a new issue, as nursing shortages were reported in hospitals in the United States of America as early as 1915 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. It remains a major concern to this day, reported in both developed and developing countries and for most of the health care professions.</p><p>Although imbalance in the health workforce is an important issue for policy-makers, various elements contribute to obscuring policy development. First, many reports of shortages are not borne out by the evidence. Rosenfeld and Moses [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] show that an overwhelming majority of newspapers, journals and newsletter articles describing the nursing situation in the United States presume the existence of a shortage. They found that even in those areas where concrete evidence of a shortage was not available, the term \"nursing shortage\" still appeared. Second, the notion of shortage is a relative one: what is considered a nursing shortage in Europe would probably be viewed differently from an African perspective. Finally, imbalances are of different types and their impact on the health care system varies. In consequence, there is a general need to critically review the imbalance issue.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature and the development of an analytical framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition</title><p>There are various approaches to defining imbalances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. From an economic perspective, a skill imbalance (shortage/surplus) occurs when the quantity of a given skill supplied by the workforce and the quantity demanded by employers diverge at the existing market conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Labour market supplies and demands for occupational skills fluctuate continuously, so at times there will be imbalances in the labour market. In other words, a shortage/surplus is the result of a disequilibrium between the demand and supply for labour. In contrast, non-economic definitions are usually normative, i.e. there is a shortage of labour relative to defined norms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. In the case of health personnel, these definitions are based either on a value judgement &#x02013; for instance, how much care people should receive &#x02013; or on a professional determination &#x02013; such as deciding what is the appropriate number of physicians for the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature</title><p>One of the key questions regarding imbalances is how long these last: Is the imbalance temporary or permanent? In a competitive labour market, we should expect most imbalances to be resolved over time. Imbalances will tend to disappear faster the greater the reaction speed and also the greater the elasticity of supply (or demand) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. This type of imbalance (shortage or surplus) is defined as dynamic.</p><p>In contrast, a static imbalance occurs because supply does not increase or decrease; market equilibrium is therefore not achieved. For instance, wage adjustments may respond slowly to shifts in demand or supply as a result of institutional and regulatory arrangements, imperfect market competition (monopoly, monopsony) and wage-control policies. Another example is physicians' education: because of the length of time required to educate physicians, changes in available supply take a long time to react significantly. Lack of information on the state of the various labour markets can also be a factor in the speed of market adjustment. To make proper labour market decisions, households and firms must be informed of the existing market conditions across markets. They must therefore know what wages are paid and the nature and location of job openings and available workers.</p><p>Moreover, we should also differentiate between qualitative and quantitative imbalance. In a tight labour market, employers might not find the ideal candidate, but will still recruit someone. Under these conditions, the issue is the quality of job candidates rather than the quantity of people willing and able to do the job [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. From the employers' perspective, a shortage of workers exists; from the job-market perspective, the existence of a shortage could be questioned because the jobs are filled. One negative hidden impact of a qualitative shortage is the number of positions that are filled with ineffective individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A conceptual framework</title><p>To better understand the role of factors affecting health workforce imbalances and to facilitate the development of policy tools, a conceptual framework is presented in this section.</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Factors affecting health workforce imbalances are numerous and complex, but focusing on crucial elements should permit insight into the issue of health workforce imbalances. The framework is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> and contains six main components: the demand for health labour, the supply of health labour, the health care system, policies, resources and \"global\" factors.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Framework for imbalance of human resources for health</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-1\"/></fig><p>Central to this framework are the demand for and supply of health labour. Also included in the framework is the health care system, and in particular, some of its features that are likely to have an impact on health workforce imbalances. Policies constitute another crucial element of the framework. In effect, health policies but also non-health-oriented policies can have an impact on health workforce imbalances. The framework also incorporates financial, physical and knowledge resources that contribute to model the health workforce.Finally, \"global\" factors such as economic, sociodemographic, political, geographical and cultural factors are included. These elements contribute directly or indirectly to shaping and transforming the entire society and hence the health workforce.</p></sec><sec><title>The demand for health personnel</title><p>The first element of the framework to be examined is the demand for health personnel. The demand for health personnel can be considered as a derived demand for health services. Accordingly, we should consider factors determining the demand for health services. Personal characteristics &#x02013; such as health needs, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics &#x02013; and economic factors play an important role.</p><p>It has often been proposed that the planning of human resources for health be based solely on estimates of health needs in the population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. However, relying only on the concept of need is difficult, because it can be defined either broadly or restrictedly and accordingly lead to a perception of either systematic shortage or surplus. Health needs is only one of the factors affecting the demand for health personnel.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of economic factors on the demand for health care. In particular in the United States, studies have attempted to estimate price and income elasticities of demand for medical services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. Measurements of price or income elasticities make it possible to evaluate the impact of a change in price or income on the demand for health care. Most studies reported elasticities in the range between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating that consumers tend to be responsive to price changes but that the degree of price sensitivity is not very large compared to that for many other goods and services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>Another element influencing the demand for health care is the value of a patient's time, such as travel time and waiting time. Acton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] found that in the United States, elasticity of demand with respect to travel time ranged between -0.6 and -1, meaning that a 10% increase in travel time would induce a reduction of 6%-10% in the demand for health care.</p><p>Other factors affect the demand for health labour. In particular, some specific features of the health care system and its features, policies, resources and environmental factors do have an impact on the demand for health labour. Their respective role will further discussed later.</p></sec><sec><title>The supply of human resources for health</title><p>After reviewing factors affecting the demand for health labour, we shall now turn to those affecting the supply of the health workforce. In particular, we shall consider the following elements: factors affecting the choice for a health professional training/education, participation in the health labour market and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Education/professional training choice</title><p>The availability of a renewed health workforce, as well as the type of profession and specialty chosen by individuals, is a major concern for health decision-makers. These issues are of particular relevance, especially since the number of younger people, predominantly women, choosing a nursing career is declining in some countries and since in professional training/education, individuals' choices do not always match the absorptive capacity of the market.</p><p>From an economic perspective, the decision to undertake professional training/education is considered an investment decision. To emphasize the essential similarities of these investments to other kinds of investments, economists refer to them as investment in human capital [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. Since investment decisions usually deliver payoffs over time, we must consider the entire stream of costs and benefits. The expected returns on human capital investments are a higher level of earnings, greater job satisfaction over one's lifetime and a greater appreciation of non-market activities and interests.</p><p>Based on the human capital approach, rate of return on education can be estimated. An average rate of return that is high and rising for a given profession will attract more individuals to that profession. On the other hand, a lower and decreasing average rate of return will discourage individuals from choosing that profession. Nowak and Preston [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], using the human capital approach, found that Australian nurses are poorly paid in comparison to other female professionals. The declining interest in nursing can be partly explained by the expansion of career opportunities in traditionally male-dominated occupations over the last three decades that entail a higher rate of return [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The number of young women entering the registered-nurse workforce has declined because many women who would have entered nursing in the past &#x02013; particularly those with high academic ability &#x02013; are now entering managerial and professional occupations that used to be traditionally male.</p><p>Besides the human capital approach, the choice of a profession can also be explained by sociopsychological factors. For instance, individuals may choose a profession because it is highly valued by the society or for family tradition. In the health sector, the satisfaction afforded by caring for people and assisting them to improve their health is an important element used by nursing schools to attract new enrollees. In the light of this approach, the decline in the number of individuals choosing nursing as a career might also be explained by the fact that this profession is now less socially valued than before [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participation in the labour market</title><p>The economic theory of the decision to work views the decision as a choice concerning how people spend their time. Individuals face a trade-off between labour and leisure. They decide how much of their time to spend working for pay or participating in leisure activities, the latter being activities that are not work-related.</p><p>An issue that has drawn a lot of attention recently is the impact of wage increases on labour participation, in particular for nurses. In the short term, higher wages can have at least two effects on the labour supply of current qualified nurses: first, qualified nurses who are working in other occupations may return to nursing activities; second, nurses now in practice may respond by working more hours. In the long run, higher wages in nursing relative to other occupations make nursing an attractive profession and will draw more people into nurse training programmes.</p><p>In their literature review of wage elasticity of nursing labour supply, Antonazzo et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] and Chiha and Link [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] found that most of the studies indicate a positive relationship, although not a strong one, between wages and labour supply. Accordingly, increases in nursing wages are unlikely to cause significant increases in labour participation. A literature review on the women's workforce undertaken by Killingsworth and Heckman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] indicated that in addition to wage rate, women's participation is responsive to changes in unearned income, spouse's wage and having children (particularly of pre-school age). Another aspect of labour supply decisions that has been investigated by Philips [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] is the costs associated with entering the nursing labour market (such as costs of child care and housework). The elasticity of participation with respect to changes in working costs was evaluated at -0.67 for all nurses. This suggests that a subsidy leading to a decrease of 10% in these costs would increase the participation of nurses by 6.7%.</p><p>Moreover, hospitals are also using a variety of strategies to recruit new staff. A survey of hospitals in the United States shows that richer benefits, such as health insurance and vacation time, are the most common incentives used. In addition, hospitals may offer other recruitment and retention benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, flexible hours and signing bonuses based on experience or length of commitment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. Many countries, but particularly developed ones, use such incentives to recruit new staff.</p><p>Economic factors also play a role in physician's participation in the labour market, as demonstrated by the impact of cost-containment policies in Canada, where most provincial governments have implemented an assortment of controls of health care expenses. Threshold reductions were introduced, so that fees payable to individual physicians were reduced as billing exceeded an agreed threshold. As a consequence, physicians who had billed at the threshold level chose to take leaves of absence rather than receive a level of reimbursement they considered inadequate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>].</p><p>When health personnel choose an alternative or additional occupation, this is likely to have consequences on health labour supply. In developing countries, and particularly in Africa, attempts to reform the health care sector have frequently failed to respond to the aspirations of staff concerning remuneration and working conditions. Salaries are often inadequate and may be paid late, and health workers try to solve their financial problems in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Private practice is only one of the many survival strategies that health personnel use to supplement their income and increase their job satisfaction. Teaching, attending training courses, supervision activities, research, trade and agriculture are some of these alternative strategies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Labour market exit</title><p>Parker and Rickam [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] examined the economic determinants of the labour force withdrawal of registered nurses in the United States, i.e. nurses leaving the profession to pursue a non-nursing occupation and employed nurses withdrawing from the labour force. Their results suggest that a significant number of registered nurses withdraw, at least temporarily, from the labour force. Among the significant elements influencing the withdrawal decision are the wage rate, other family income, presence of children and full-time/part-time work status. Increasing registered nurses' wages and working full-time is expected to reduce the probability of labour force withdrawal, whereas higher education levels, age and other family income increase the probability of labour force withdrawal.</p><p>The relative importance of wage is also emphasized by studies investigating job satisfaction. There is support in the empirical literature for the existence of job dissatisfaction among nurses, and the link between job dissatisfaction and job exit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]. In the United States the most important factors in nurses' resignation were, in order of importance: workload, staffing, time with patients, flexible scheduling, respect from nursing administration, increasing nursing knowledge, promotion opportunities, work stimulation, salary and decision-making. These studies suggest that salary is just one of the reasons why nurses are quitting. The relative importance of wage is confirmed by Shields and Ward [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]. Their results suggest that dissatisfaction with promotion and training opportunities has a stronger impact than workload or pay.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration</title><p>Migration of health personnel can have a serious impact on the supply of human resources in health, because it may exacerbate health personnel imbalances in \"sending\" countries. It is suggested that migration is an \"individual, spontaneous and voluntary act\" that is motivated by the perceived net gain of migrating &#x02013; that is, the gain will offset the tangible and intangible costs of moving [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Decisions to migrate are often a family strategy to produce a better income and improve survival chances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>The reality for many health workers in developing countries is to be underpaid, poorly motivated and increasingly dissatisfied and sceptical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. The relevance of motivation to migration is self-evident. There can be little doubt that for many health workers an improvement in pay and conditions will act as an incentive to stay in the country. Improved pensions, child care, educational opportunities and recognition are also known to be important [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. In Ghana it is estimated that only 191 of the 489 doctors who graduated between 1985 and 1994 were still working in the country in 1997 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Health system characteristics</title><p>As the health workforce is part of the health care system, we shall also consider features of the health care system that are likely to have an impact on the demand and supply of health labour. In particular, we shall examine market failures, the diversity of stakeholders, the supply-demand adjustment time lag and hospitals' potential monopsony power.</p></sec><sec><title>Market failures</title><p>From an economic perspective, the health care market is characterized by market failures &#x02013; that is, the assumptions for perfect competition are violated. From a societal perspective, in the presence of market failures such as externalities &#x02013; imperfect knowledge, asymmetry of information and uncertainty &#x02013; market mechanisms lead to a non-optimal demand and/or supply in health services. In other words, shortages and surpluses are likely to result from the health care market.</p><p>Most markets are characterized by market failures, but what is unique to the health services market is the extent of these market failures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Governments try to correct health care market failures through policy interventions. A classic example of public intervention in the presence of a positive externality is the introduction of a policy of mandatory vaccination. However, implementing such policies is sometimes difficult and may result in only partial correction of the market failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Stakeholders</title><p>The health care system is characterized by a wide range of institutional stakeholders involved in shaping human resources for health, all of whom may have different objectives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. The objectives of a union or professional association do not necessarily coincide, for example, with those of a government ministry, a hospital manager or the central government. Unions/professional associations seek to increase their members' market power, employment and income [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], whereas the ministry of finance will want more budget equilibrium and will favour measures to limit health care expenditures.</p><p>In the case of Mozambique, whereas the policy of employing national professionals by cooperation agencies has met with warm support from national cadres, its effect on the health sector is problematic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. The prospect of immediate financial gains puts pressure on qualified professionals to leave their posts within the Mozambique National Health Service to take up management or consultant positions. The substantial investment in their training is therefore producing dubious direct returns to the National Health Service. More seriously perhaps, the presence of donor-paid jobs outside the health sector (as programme coordinators, researchers, etc.) is creating pressure on the Ministry of Health itself, exacerbating the imbalances in the National Health Service and creating incentives for trained Mozambicans to leave the public sector.</p></sec><sec><title>Time lag</title><p>Moreover, adjustments between the demand and supply for health personnel may take a long time. In the health care field; the time lag between education and practising may be quite substantial. To obtain licensure to practise medicine requires lengthy education and training, and the long lag time between a changed student intake and a change in supply has been noted [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]: supply adjustment for physicians is not immediate, but takes a long time.</p></sec><sec><title>Hospitals' potential monopsony power</title><p>A single entity that is the sole purchaser of labour is a <italic>monopsony</italic>. One example is the potential monopsony power of hospitals in hiring nurses or the ministry of health in hiring the health workforce. The amount of labour demanded will influence the price the monopsonist must pay for it. In contrast to the situation in a competitive market, the monopsony is a price maker, not a price taker. Monopsony results in lower wages and lower employment of nurses compared to a competitive market.</p><p>A number of studies have tested whether or not hospitals possess monopsony power with respect to nurses, and the results are contradictory. Sullivan [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>] and Staiger et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>] concluded that hospitals have a substantial degree of monopsony power. In contrast, Hirsch and Schumacher [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>] did not find empirical support for the monopsony model. Nurses' wages were found not to be related to hospital density and to decrease rather than increase with respect to labour market size.</p></sec><sec><title>Provider power/monopoly</title><p>In contrast, providers' power may enable the latter to restrict the supply of human resources for health. Seldon, Jung and Cavazos [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such avenues as restricting supply and price-fixing. In France, trade unions are granted an institutional role at establishment level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. In India and Sri Lanka, a clear constraint to support-services contracting was the inability to counter the power of the public service unions in dictating employment terms and conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. The varying degree of homogeneity of the different professional groups may also explain their relative success in maintaining a monopoly of practice. In Iceland, one of the factors that contributed to breaking the professional monopoly of pharmacists was division within the profession [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Regulations</title><p>The type off regulation associated with a profession plays an important role regarding the supply of members of a profession. Regulation has, by tradition, been achieved through a combination of direct government regulation and, to a large extent, through rules adopted by professional associations, whose self-regulatory powers enable them to establish both entry requirements and rules regarding professional conduct [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>].</p><p>Such barriers to entry exist in particular for doctors, but also in other health professions, such as dentistry. Some argue that these barriers constitute a means to limit entry into the profession, and hence maintain high incomes. Muzondo and Pazderka [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] established, for Canadian professional licensing restrictions, a relationship between different variables of self-regulation and higher income. Seldon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such sources as restricting supply and price-fixing. However, the proponents of self-regulation claim that these barriers are a means to provide health care of quality and to protect patients from incompetent providers. In contrast, although most countries have a professional nursing association, nurses tend to have limited power to regulate entry to the profession. This could be associated with a large diversity of specialist groups in nursing failing to unite on issues related to professional regulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Health and non-health policies</title><p>Health and non-health policies contribute to shaping the health care system and have an influence on the demand and supply of health labour.</p><p>Health policy can be defined as a formal statement or procedure within institutions (notably government) that defines priorities and the parameters for action in response to health needs, available resources and other political pressures. Health policy is often enacted through legislation or other forms of rule-making that create regulations and incentives for providing health services and programmes and access to them. For instance, the decision to introduce or expand health insurance coverage is likely to have an impact on the demand for health services. This is illustrated by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, a controlled experiment that increased knowledge about the effect of different insurance copayments on use of medical services. Insurance copayments ranged from zero to 95%. The RAND study concluded that as the co-insurance rose, overall use and expenditure fell for adults and children combined [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>].</p><p>Non-health policies reflect state interventions in areas such as employment, education and regional development that contribute to shaping the health workforce. These policies do not directly address health issues, but have an indirect impact on such issues. In France, a controversial new regulation was introduced that reduced the workweek to a maximum of 35 hours in an attempt both to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and to achieve greater flexibility in the labour force. Unions responded by demanding the creation of more posts in public hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial, physical and knowledge resources</title><p>Financial, physical and knowledge resources are crucial to any type of health care workforce. The level of resources attributed to the health care system, and how these resources are used, will have a significant impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>In terms of financial resources, human resources account for a high proportion of national budgets assigned to the health sector [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Health expenditure claims an increasingly important share of the gross domestic product and, in most countries, wage costs (salaries, bonuses and other payments) are estimated to account for between 65% and 80% of the renewable health system expenditure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>].</p><p>Physical resources include human resources within the health sector and other sectors; buildings and engineering services such as sanitation, water and heating systems for community use and for the use of medical care institutions; and equipment and supplies. Finally, the health workforce is also constrained by its human capital. This human capital can be associated with the qualification and education of the health workforce. Education of the health workforce is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given in preparation for work.</p></sec><sec><title>Global factors</title><p>Economic, sociodemographic, cultural, and geographical factors contribute to shaping and transforming society and hence have a direct or indirect impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>From an economic perspective, for instance, there is evidence of a correlation between the level of economic development of a country and its level of human resources for health. Countries with higher GDP per capita are said to spend more on health care than countries with lower income, as demonstrated by cross-sectional studies, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>] and hence would also tend to have larger health workforces.</p><p>Moreover, both the demand and supply are likely to be affected by sociodemographic elements such as the age distribution of the population. On the demand side, the ageing of the population is giving rise to an increase in the demand for health services and health personnel, especially nurses for home care.</p><p>On the supply side, the ageing of the health workforce, and in particular of nurses, has serious implications for the future of the nursing labour market. For example, the Institute of Medicine noted that older registered nurses have a reduced capacity to perform certain tasks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. It was found that between 1983 and 1998 the average age of practising registered nurses increased by more than four years, from 37.4 to 41.9 years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. In contrast, the average age of the United States workforce as a whole increased by less than two years during the same period. Furthermore, the proportion of the registered-nurse workforce younger than 30 years decreased from 30.3% to 12.1% during this period.</p><p>Geographical and cultural factors also play a role in determining the demand and supply of human resources. Geographical characteristics affect the organization of health services delivery. For instance, a country with many islands or with isolated population groups will face particular challenges in terms of health workforce issues. Similarly, significant climatic changes are likely to give rise to changes in health needs, which in turn will call for changes in health services and in the health workforce. Finally, both cultural and political values also affect the demand for and supply of human resources for health.</p></sec><sec><title>Health workforce imbalances: a typology</title><p>This section considers a typology of imbalances, and differentiates between the following:</p><p>&#x02022; Profession/specialty imbalances: Under this category, we consider imbalance in the various health professions, such as doctors or nurses, as well as shortages within a profession, e.g. shortage of one type of specialists.</p><p>&#x02022; Geographical imbalances: These are disparities between urban and rural regions and poor and rich regions.</p><p>&#x02022; Institutional and services imbalances: These are differences in health workforce supply between health care facilities, as well as between services.</p><p>&#x02022; Gender imbalances: These are disparities in female/male representation in the health workforce.</p><sec><title>Profession/specialty imbalances</title><p>Imbalances have been reported for almost all health professions, and in particular for nurses. The United States General Accounting Office [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>] reports a nursing shortage. However, the nursing shortage has not been institution-wide but is concentrated in specialty care areas, particularly intensive care units and operating rooms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The shortage of registered nurses in intensive care units is explained in part by the sharp decline in the number of younger registered nurses, whom intensive care units have historically attracted. Shortages in operating rooms probably reflect that many registered nurses who work in this setting are reaching the age when they are beginning to reduce their hours worked or are retiring altogether.</p><p>Major variations occur in the number of health care workers per capita population and in the skill mix employed across countries, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor ratio varies widely from one country to another, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor skill mix is important and may have consequences for the respective tasks of nurses and doctors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that these variations are taking place among countries with a relatively similar economic development level.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of physicians, nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists in selected countries. WHO data, 2000.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-2\"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Geographical imbalances</title><p>Virtually all countries suffer from a geographical maldistribution of human resources for health, and the primary area of concern is usually the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In both industrialized and developing countries, urban areas almost invariably have a substantially higher concentration of physicians than rural areas.</p><p>Understandably, most health care professionals prefer to settle in urban areas, which offer opportunities for professional development as well as education and other amenities for themselves and their families. But it is in the rural and remote areas, especially in the developing countries, that most severe public health problems are found.</p><p>The geographical maldistribution of doctors has been the object of particular attention. In general there is a higher concentration of general practitioners in the inner suburbs of the metropolitan areas. According to the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>], the reasons for high concentration of general practitioners in inner city areas are:</p><p>&#x02022; historical</p><p>&#x02022; lifestyle-related: access to amenities</p><p>&#x02022; spouse/husband-related: greater employment opportunities</p><p>&#x02022; child-related: better access to secondary and tertiary education services</p><p>&#x02022; professional, family and social ties and professional ambitions.</p><p>The geographical distribution of health care personnel is an important issue in many countries. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, contains one-fifth of the country's population but around half of the available health personnel [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>]. In Bangladesh, most of the doctors (35%) and nurses (30%) in health services are located in four metropolitan districts where only 14.5% of the population lives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B70\">70</xref>]. This concentration pattern is characteristic of developing countries.</p><p>In Indonesia the geographical distribution of physicians is a particular concern, since Indonesia's vast size and difficult geography present a tremendous challenge to health service delivery [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B71\">71</xref>]. It is difficult to place doctors in remote islands or mountain or forest locations with few amenities, no opportunities for private practice, and poor communications with the rest of the country.</p><p>To improve the geographical distribution of physicians, governments often have used combinations of compulsory service and incentives. So far, there is virtually no country in the world that has solved the problem of a rural/urban imbalance of the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. This does not necessarily mean that policies and programmes designed to reduce the imbalance have had no effect. For example, Thailand has successfully begun to stem the migration of health professionals from rural to urban areas and from public to private facilities with a range of strong financial incentives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B72\">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Institutional and services imbalances</title><p>Institutional imbalances occur when some health care facilities have too many staff because of prestige, working conditions, ability to generate additional income, or other situation-specific factors, while others are understaffed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B73\">73</xref>]. Institutions such as magnet hospitals, for example, are hospitals characterized by adequate to excellent staffing, low turnover, rich nursing skill mix and greater job satisfaction, among other factors, even in the face of a general health personnel shortage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B74\">74</xref>].</p><p>Imbalance between the types of health services provided may also arise. In particular, we can consider the issue of curative versus preventive care. In effect, it has been estimated that most diseases (80%) and accidents are preventable through known methodologies, yet at present there is an imbalance in the funding of medical research, with only 1%-2% going to prevention and 98%-99% spent on curative approaches [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B75\">75</xref>]. This imbalance in funding raises the question of a health workforce imbalance between preventive and curative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Gender imbalances</title><p>In many countries, women still tend to concentrate in the lower-status health occupations and to be a minority among more highly trained professionals and managers. In Bangladesh, the distribution by gender of the health workforce shows that the total proportion of women accounts for little more than one-fifth in health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>]. The distribution of women by occupational category is biased in favour of nurses. Women are very poorly represented in other categories, such as dentists, medical assistants, pharmacists, managers/trainers and doctors. The underrepresentation of women in managerial and decision-making positions may lead to less attention to and poorer understanding of the problems specific to women and the particularities of their utilization patterns [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B77\">77</xref>].</p><p>Female general practitioners have been shown to practise differently from males, managing different types of medical conditions, with some differences due to patient mix and patient selectivity, and others inherent in the sex of physician. In some more traditional areas, some women will not seek care for themselves or even for their children because they do not have access to a female provider [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This framework can be used to assess policy reforms and their impact on health workforce imbalances; it also provides a common framework for cross-country comparisons. This framework emphasizes the number and type of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, illustrating the complexity of this issue. From a policy perspective, it is particularly interesting to identify factors that policy-makers can influence in order to remedy imbalance problems.</p><p>Various monetary and non-monetary incentives are used to influence the supply and/or demand for the health workforce. For example, subsidies, grants and scholarships are examples of incentives that can be used to attract more nursing students, whereas wage increases, additional benefits and working hours flexibility are examples of commonly used incentives to attract or retain the health workforce.</p><p>The numerous factors and actors involved in the health workforce imbalance issue call for a coherent health workforce vision and policy. In that context, health planning plays an important role since it contributes to shaping the health care system. Moreover, since from a societal perspective market mechanisms alone do not allow an adequate demand/supply of health personnel to be reached, public interventions such as human resources planning are a means to correct for market failures. Health planning involves a time horizon. Forecasting the future number of health personnel needed and developing policies to meet such figures are common to any health care system. Physicians represent the profession for which more planning effort has been expended to achieve a workforce of appropriate size than for any other health profession. Countries' desire to meet population health needs and to avoid social welfare losses resulting from a shortage or an oversupply are factors explaining, to a large extent, the importance attributed to planning in the context of public health policies.</p><p>The policy implications of forecasting either a shortage or a surplus of health care personnel are different, and hence attempts at projections must be rigorous. For instance, referring to previous studies predicting significant surpluses, Cooper [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B78\">78</xref>] notes that such large surpluses have not occurred so far, because of a decrease in physician work effort. Factors such as age, sex and lifestyle contributed to this evolution.</p><p>As a result of forecasted physician surpluses, various policy recommendations have been formulated. The United States Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B79\">79</xref>] published a report recommending, among other things, that there be no new medical schools, that existing schools should not increase their class size and that the number of first-year residency positions should be reduced. The Pew Health Professions Commission Report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B80\">80</xref>] issued a report recommending more severe steps, such as the closing of some medical schools and tightening the visa process for international medical graduates.</p><p>This framework also apprehends the different types of imbalances. This is important since the choice of a policy will also depend on the type of imbalance. Significant disparities in human resources for health between health occupation, regions, gender or health services are recognized as classic problems of imbalance. However, the question of a public/private imbalance is more debatable. One the one hand, we can argue that for equity and access, a health care system should have a strong public component. On the other hand, we can imagine a private-sector oriented health care system with mechanisms to ensure access to the poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of imbalances in the health workforce, this paper has discussed a framework for human resources for health and proposed a typology of imbalances. Although the term \"imbalance\" is commonly used with respect to the health workforce, it is clear that imbalance in the health workforce encompasses a wide range of possible situations and is a complex issue. The use of a framework should facilitate the development of policy tools and their assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'

Imbalance is not a new issue, as nursing shortages were reported in hospitals in the United States of America as early as 1915 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. It remains a major concern to this day, reported in both developed and developing countries and for most of the health care professions.</p><p>Although imbalance in the health workforce is an important issue for policy-makers, various elements contribute to obscuring policy development. First, many reports of shortages are not borne out by the evidence. Rosenfeld and Moses [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] show that an overwhelming majority of newspapers, journals and newsletter articles describing the nursing situation in the United States presume the existence of a shortage. They found that even in those areas where concrete evidence of a shortage was not available, the term \"nursing shortage\" still appeared. Second, the notion of shortage is a relative one: what is considered a nursing shortage in Europe would probably be viewed differently from an African perspective. Finally, imbalances are of different types and their impact on the health care system varies. In consequence, there is a general need to critically review the imbalance issue.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature and the development of an analytical framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition</title><p>There are various approaches to defining imbalances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. From an economic perspective, a skill imbalance (shortage/surplus) occurs when the quantity of a given skill supplied by the workforce and the quantity demanded by employers diverge at the existing market conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Labour market supplies and demands for occupational skills fluctuate continuously, so at times there will be imbalances in the labour market. In other words, a shortage/surplus is the result of a disequilibrium between the demand and supply for labour. In contrast, non-economic definitions are usually normative, i.e. there is a shortage of labour relative to defined norms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. In the case of health personnel, these definitions are based either on a value judgement &#x02013; for instance, how much care people should receive &#x02013; or on a professional determination &#x02013; such as deciding what is the appropriate number of physicians for the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature</title><p>One of the key questions regarding imbalances is how long these last: Is the imbalance temporary or permanent? In a competitive labour market, we should expect most imbalances to be resolved over time. Imbalances will tend to disappear faster the greater the reaction speed and also the greater the elasticity of supply (or demand) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. This type of imbalance (shortage or surplus) is defined as dynamic.</p><p>In contrast, a static imbalance occurs because supply does not increase or decrease; market equilibrium is therefore not achieved. For instance, wage adjustments may respond slowly to shifts in demand or supply as a result of institutional and regulatory arrangements, imperfect market competition (monopoly, monopsony) and wage-control policies. Another example is physicians' education: because of the length of time required to educate physicians, changes in available supply take a long time to react significantly. Lack of information on the state of the various labour markets can also be a factor in the speed of market adjustment. To make proper labour market decisions, households and firms must be informed of the existing market conditions across markets. They must therefore know what wages are paid and the nature and location of job openings and available workers.</p><p>Moreover, we should also differentiate between qualitative and quantitative imbalance. In a tight labour market, employers might not find the ideal candidate, but will still recruit someone. Under these conditions, the issue is the quality of job candidates rather than the quantity of people willing and able to do the job [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. From the employers' perspective, a shortage of workers exists; from the job-market perspective, the existence of a shortage could be questioned because the jobs are filled. One negative hidden impact of a qualitative shortage is the number of positions that are filled with ineffective individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A conceptual framework</title><p>To better understand the role of factors affecting health workforce imbalances and to facilitate the development of policy tools, a conceptual framework is presented in this section.</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Factors affecting health workforce imbalances are numerous and complex, but focusing on crucial elements should permit insight into the issue of health workforce imbalances. The framework is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> and contains six main components: the demand for health labour, the supply of health labour, the health care system, policies, resources and \"global\" factors.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Framework for imbalance of human resources for health</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-1\"/></fig><p>Central to this framework are the demand for and supply of health labour. Also included in the framework is the health care system, and in particular, some of its features that are likely to have an impact on health workforce imbalances. Policies constitute another crucial element of the framework. In effect, health policies but also non-health-oriented policies can have an impact on health workforce imbalances. The framework also incorporates financial, physical and knowledge resources that contribute to model the health workforce.Finally, \"global\" factors such as economic, sociodemographic, political, geographical and cultural factors are included. These elements contribute directly or indirectly to shaping and transforming the entire society and hence the health workforce.</p></sec><sec><title>The demand for health personnel</title><p>The first element of the framework to be examined is the demand for health personnel. The demand for health personnel can be considered as a derived demand for health services. Accordingly, we should consider factors determining the demand for health services. Personal characteristics &#x02013; such as health needs, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics &#x02013; and economic factors play an important role.</p><p>It has often been proposed that the planning of human resources for health be based solely on estimates of health needs in the population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. However, relying only on the concept of need is difficult, because it can be defined either broadly or restrictedly and accordingly lead to a perception of either systematic shortage or surplus. Health needs is only one of the factors affecting the demand for health personnel.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of economic factors on the demand for health care. In particular in the United States, studies have attempted to estimate price and income elasticities of demand for medical services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. Measurements of price or income elasticities make it possible to evaluate the impact of a change in price or income on the demand for health care. Most studies reported elasticities in the range between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating that consumers tend to be responsive to price changes but that the degree of price sensitivity is not very large compared to that for many other goods and services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>Another element influencing the demand for health care is the value of a patient's time, such as travel time and waiting time. Acton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] found that in the United States, elasticity of demand with respect to travel time ranged between -0.6 and -1, meaning that a 10% increase in travel time would induce a reduction of 6%-10% in the demand for health care.</p><p>Other factors affect the demand for health labour. In particular, some specific features of the health care system and its features, policies, resources and environmental factors do have an impact on the demand for health labour. Their respective role will further discussed later.</p></sec><sec><title>The supply of human resources for health</title><p>After reviewing factors affecting the demand for health labour, we shall now turn to those affecting the supply of the health workforce. In particular, we shall consider the following elements: factors affecting the choice for a health professional training/education, participation in the health labour market and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Education/professional training choice</title><p>The availability of a renewed health workforce, as well as the type of profession and specialty chosen by individuals, is a major concern for health decision-makers. These issues are of particular relevance, especially since the number of younger people, predominantly women, choosing a nursing career is declining in some countries and since in professional training/education, individuals' choices do not always match the absorptive capacity of the market.</p><p>From an economic perspective, the decision to undertake professional training/education is considered an investment decision. To emphasize the essential similarities of these investments to other kinds of investments, economists refer to them as investment in human capital [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. Since investment decisions usually deliver payoffs over time, we must consider the entire stream of costs and benefits. The expected returns on human capital investments are a higher level of earnings, greater job satisfaction over one's lifetime and a greater appreciation of non-market activities and interests.</p><p>Based on the human capital approach, rate of return on education can be estimated. An average rate of return that is high and rising for a given profession will attract more individuals to that profession. On the other hand, a lower and decreasing average rate of return will discourage individuals from choosing that profession. Nowak and Preston [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], using the human capital approach, found that Australian nurses are poorly paid in comparison to other female professionals. The declining interest in nursing can be partly explained by the expansion of career opportunities in traditionally male-dominated occupations over the last three decades that entail a higher rate of return [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The number of young women entering the registered-nurse workforce has declined because many women who would have entered nursing in the past &#x02013; particularly those with high academic ability &#x02013; are now entering managerial and professional occupations that used to be traditionally male.</p><p>Besides the human capital approach, the choice of a profession can also be explained by sociopsychological factors. For instance, individuals may choose a profession because it is highly valued by the society or for family tradition. In the health sector, the satisfaction afforded by caring for people and assisting them to improve their health is an important element used by nursing schools to attract new enrollees. In the light of this approach, the decline in the number of individuals choosing nursing as a career might also be explained by the fact that this profession is now less socially valued than before [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participation in the labour market</title><p>The economic theory of the decision to work views the decision as a choice concerning how people spend their time. Individuals face a trade-off between labour and leisure. They decide how much of their time to spend working for pay or participating in leisure activities, the latter being activities that are not work-related.</p><p>An issue that has drawn a lot of attention recently is the impact of wage increases on labour participation, in particular for nurses. In the short term, higher wages can have at least two effects on the labour supply of current qualified nurses: first, qualified nurses who are working in other occupations may return to nursing activities; second, nurses now in practice may respond by working more hours. In the long run, higher wages in nursing relative to other occupations make nursing an attractive profession and will draw more people into nurse training programmes.</p><p>In their literature review of wage elasticity of nursing labour supply, Antonazzo et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] and Chiha and Link [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] found that most of the studies indicate a positive relationship, although not a strong one, between wages and labour supply. Accordingly, increases in nursing wages are unlikely to cause significant increases in labour participation. A literature review on the women's workforce undertaken by Killingsworth and Heckman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] indicated that in addition to wage rate, women's participation is responsive to changes in unearned income, spouse's wage and having children (particularly of pre-school age). Another aspect of labour supply decisions that has been investigated by Philips [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] is the costs associated with entering the nursing labour market (such as costs of child care and housework). The elasticity of participation with respect to changes in working costs was evaluated at -0.67 for all nurses. This suggests that a subsidy leading to a decrease of 10% in these costs would increase the participation of nurses by 6.7%.</p><p>Moreover, hospitals are also using a variety of strategies to recruit new staff. A survey of hospitals in the United States shows that richer benefits, such as health insurance and vacation time, are the most common incentives used. In addition, hospitals may offer other recruitment and retention benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, flexible hours and signing bonuses based on experience or length of commitment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. Many countries, but particularly developed ones, use such incentives to recruit new staff.</p><p>Economic factors also play a role in physician's participation in the labour market, as demonstrated by the impact of cost-containment policies in Canada, where most provincial governments have implemented an assortment of controls of health care expenses. Threshold reductions were introduced, so that fees payable to individual physicians were reduced as billing exceeded an agreed threshold. As a consequence, physicians who had billed at the threshold level chose to take leaves of absence rather than receive a level of reimbursement they considered inadequate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>].</p><p>When health personnel choose an alternative or additional occupation, this is likely to have consequences on health labour supply. In developing countries, and particularly in Africa, attempts to reform the health care sector have frequently failed to respond to the aspirations of staff concerning remuneration and working conditions. Salaries are often inadequate and may be paid late, and health workers try to solve their financial problems in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Private practice is only one of the many survival strategies that health personnel use to supplement their income and increase their job satisfaction. Teaching, attending training courses, supervision activities, research, trade and agriculture are some of these alternative strategies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Labour market exit</title><p>Parker and Rickam [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] examined the economic determinants of the labour force withdrawal of registered nurses in the United States, i.e. nurses leaving the profession to pursue a non-nursing occupation and employed nurses withdrawing from the labour force. Their results suggest that a significant number of registered nurses withdraw, at least temporarily, from the labour force. Among the significant elements influencing the withdrawal decision are the wage rate, other family income, presence of children and full-time/part-time work status. Increasing registered nurses' wages and working full-time is expected to reduce the probability of labour force withdrawal, whereas higher education levels, age and other family income increase the probability of labour force withdrawal.</p><p>The relative importance of wage is also emphasized by studies investigating job satisfaction. There is support in the empirical literature for the existence of job dissatisfaction among nurses, and the link between job dissatisfaction and job exit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]. In the United States the most important factors in nurses' resignation were, in order of importance: workload, staffing, time with patients, flexible scheduling, respect from nursing administration, increasing nursing knowledge, promotion opportunities, work stimulation, salary and decision-making. These studies suggest that salary is just one of the reasons why nurses are quitting. The relative importance of wage is confirmed by Shields and Ward [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]. Their results suggest that dissatisfaction with promotion and training opportunities has a stronger impact than workload or pay.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration</title><p>Migration of health personnel can have a serious impact on the supply of human resources in health, because it may exacerbate health personnel imbalances in \"sending\" countries. It is suggested that migration is an \"individual, spontaneous and voluntary act\" that is motivated by the perceived net gain of migrating &#x02013; that is, the gain will offset the tangible and intangible costs of moving [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Decisions to migrate are often a family strategy to produce a better income and improve survival chances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>The reality for many health workers in developing countries is to be underpaid, poorly motivated and increasingly dissatisfied and sceptical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. The relevance of motivation to migration is self-evident. There can be little doubt that for many health workers an improvement in pay and conditions will act as an incentive to stay in the country. Improved pensions, child care, educational opportunities and recognition are also known to be important [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. In Ghana it is estimated that only 191 of the 489 doctors who graduated between 1985 and 1994 were still working in the country in 1997 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Health system characteristics</title><p>As the health workforce is part of the health care system, we shall also consider features of the health care system that are likely to have an impact on the demand and supply of health labour. In particular, we shall examine market failures, the diversity of stakeholders, the supply-demand adjustment time lag and hospitals' potential monopsony power.</p></sec><sec><title>Market failures</title><p>From an economic perspective, the health care market is characterized by market failures &#x02013; that is, the assumptions for perfect competition are violated. From a societal perspective, in the presence of market failures such as externalities &#x02013; imperfect knowledge, asymmetry of information and uncertainty &#x02013; market mechanisms lead to a non-optimal demand and/or supply in health services. In other words, shortages and surpluses are likely to result from the health care market.</p><p>Most markets are characterized by market failures, but what is unique to the health services market is the extent of these market failures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Governments try to correct health care market failures through policy interventions. A classic example of public intervention in the presence of a positive externality is the introduction of a policy of mandatory vaccination. However, implementing such policies is sometimes difficult and may result in only partial correction of the market failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Stakeholders</title><p>The health care system is characterized by a wide range of institutional stakeholders involved in shaping human resources for health, all of whom may have different objectives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. The objectives of a union or professional association do not necessarily coincide, for example, with those of a government ministry, a hospital manager or the central government. Unions/professional associations seek to increase their members' market power, employment and income [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], whereas the ministry of finance will want more budget equilibrium and will favour measures to limit health care expenditures.</p><p>In the case of Mozambique, whereas the policy of employing national professionals by cooperation agencies has met with warm support from national cadres, its effect on the health sector is problematic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. The prospect of immediate financial gains puts pressure on qualified professionals to leave their posts within the Mozambique National Health Service to take up management or consultant positions. The substantial investment in their training is therefore producing dubious direct returns to the National Health Service. More seriously perhaps, the presence of donor-paid jobs outside the health sector (as programme coordinators, researchers, etc.) is creating pressure on the Ministry of Health itself, exacerbating the imbalances in the National Health Service and creating incentives for trained Mozambicans to leave the public sector.</p></sec><sec><title>Time lag</title><p>Moreover, adjustments between the demand and supply for health personnel may take a long time. In the health care field; the time lag between education and practising may be quite substantial. To obtain licensure to practise medicine requires lengthy education and training, and the long lag time between a changed student intake and a change in supply has been noted [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]: supply adjustment for physicians is not immediate, but takes a long time.</p></sec><sec><title>Hospitals' potential monopsony power</title><p>A single entity that is the sole purchaser of labour is a <italic>monopsony</italic>. One example is the potential monopsony power of hospitals in hiring nurses or the ministry of health in hiring the health workforce. The amount of labour demanded will influence the price the monopsonist must pay for it. In contrast to the situation in a competitive market, the monopsony is a price maker, not a price taker. Monopsony results in lower wages and lower employment of nurses compared to a competitive market.</p><p>A number of studies have tested whether or not hospitals possess monopsony power with respect to nurses, and the results are contradictory. Sullivan [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>] and Staiger et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>] concluded that hospitals have a substantial degree of monopsony power. In contrast, Hirsch and Schumacher [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>] did not find empirical support for the monopsony model. Nurses' wages were found not to be related to hospital density and to decrease rather than increase with respect to labour market size.</p></sec><sec><title>Provider power/monopoly</title><p>In contrast, providers' power may enable the latter to restrict the supply of human resources for health. Seldon, Jung and Cavazos [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such avenues as restricting supply and price-fixing. In France, trade unions are granted an institutional role at establishment level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. In India and Sri Lanka, a clear constraint to support-services contracting was the inability to counter the power of the public service unions in dictating employment terms and conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. The varying degree of homogeneity of the different professional groups may also explain their relative success in maintaining a monopoly of practice. In Iceland, one of the factors that contributed to breaking the professional monopoly of pharmacists was division within the profession [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Regulations</title><p>The type off regulation associated with a profession plays an important role regarding the supply of members of a profession. Regulation has, by tradition, been achieved through a combination of direct government regulation and, to a large extent, through rules adopted by professional associations, whose self-regulatory powers enable them to establish both entry requirements and rules regarding professional conduct [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>].</p><p>Such barriers to entry exist in particular for doctors, but also in other health professions, such as dentistry. Some argue that these barriers constitute a means to limit entry into the profession, and hence maintain high incomes. Muzondo and Pazderka [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] established, for Canadian professional licensing restrictions, a relationship between different variables of self-regulation and higher income. Seldon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such sources as restricting supply and price-fixing. However, the proponents of self-regulation claim that these barriers are a means to provide health care of quality and to protect patients from incompetent providers. In contrast, although most countries have a professional nursing association, nurses tend to have limited power to regulate entry to the profession. This could be associated with a large diversity of specialist groups in nursing failing to unite on issues related to professional regulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Health and non-health policies</title><p>Health and non-health policies contribute to shaping the health care system and have an influence on the demand and supply of health labour.</p><p>Health policy can be defined as a formal statement or procedure within institutions (notably government) that defines priorities and the parameters for action in response to health needs, available resources and other political pressures. Health policy is often enacted through legislation or other forms of rule-making that create regulations and incentives for providing health services and programmes and access to them. For instance, the decision to introduce or expand health insurance coverage is likely to have an impact on the demand for health services. This is illustrated by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, a controlled experiment that increased knowledge about the effect of different insurance copayments on use of medical services. Insurance copayments ranged from zero to 95%. The RAND study concluded that as the co-insurance rose, overall use and expenditure fell for adults and children combined [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>].</p><p>Non-health policies reflect state interventions in areas such as employment, education and regional development that contribute to shaping the health workforce. These policies do not directly address health issues, but have an indirect impact on such issues. In France, a controversial new regulation was introduced that reduced the workweek to a maximum of 35 hours in an attempt both to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and to achieve greater flexibility in the labour force. Unions responded by demanding the creation of more posts in public hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial, physical and knowledge resources</title><p>Financial, physical and knowledge resources are crucial to any type of health care workforce. The level of resources attributed to the health care system, and how these resources are used, will have a significant impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>In terms of financial resources, human resources account for a high proportion of national budgets assigned to the health sector [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Health expenditure claims an increasingly important share of the gross domestic product and, in most countries, wage costs (salaries, bonuses and other payments) are estimated to account for between 65% and 80% of the renewable health system expenditure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>].</p><p>Physical resources include human resources within the health sector and other sectors; buildings and engineering services such as sanitation, water and heating systems for community use and for the use of medical care institutions; and equipment and supplies. Finally, the health workforce is also constrained by its human capital. This human capital can be associated with the qualification and education of the health workforce. Education of the health workforce is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given in preparation for work.</p></sec><sec><title>Global factors</title><p>Economic, sociodemographic, cultural, and geographical factors contribute to shaping and transforming society and hence have a direct or indirect impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>From an economic perspective, for instance, there is evidence of a correlation between the level of economic development of a country and its level of human resources for health. Countries with higher GDP per capita are said to spend more on health care than countries with lower income, as demonstrated by cross-sectional studies, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>] and hence would also tend to have larger health workforces.</p><p>Moreover, both the demand and supply are likely to be affected by sociodemographic elements such as the age distribution of the population. On the demand side, the ageing of the population is giving rise to an increase in the demand for health services and health personnel, especially nurses for home care.</p><p>On the supply side, the ageing of the health workforce, and in particular of nurses, has serious implications for the future of the nursing labour market. For example, the Institute of Medicine noted that older registered nurses have a reduced capacity to perform certain tasks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. It was found that between 1983 and 1998 the average age of practising registered nurses increased by more than four years, from 37.4 to 41.9 years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. In contrast, the average age of the United States workforce as a whole increased by less than two years during the same period. Furthermore, the proportion of the registered-nurse workforce younger than 30 years decreased from 30.3% to 12.1% during this period.</p><p>Geographical and cultural factors also play a role in determining the demand and supply of human resources. Geographical characteristics affect the organization of health services delivery. For instance, a country with many islands or with isolated population groups will face particular challenges in terms of health workforce issues. Similarly, significant climatic changes are likely to give rise to changes in health needs, which in turn will call for changes in health services and in the health workforce. Finally, both cultural and political values also affect the demand for and supply of human resources for health.</p></sec><sec><title>Health workforce imbalances: a typology</title><p>This section considers a typology of imbalances, and differentiates between the following:</p><p>&#x02022; Profession/specialty imbalances: Under this category, we consider imbalance in the various health professions, such as doctors or nurses, as well as shortages within a profession, e.g. shortage of one type of specialists.</p><p>&#x02022; Geographical imbalances: These are disparities between urban and rural regions and poor and rich regions.</p><p>&#x02022; Institutional and services imbalances: These are differences in health workforce supply between health care facilities, as well as between services.</p><p>&#x02022; Gender imbalances: These are disparities in female/male representation in the health workforce.</p><sec><title>Profession/specialty imbalances</title><p>Imbalances have been reported for almost all health professions, and in particular for nurses. The United States General Accounting Office [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>] reports a nursing shortage. However, the nursing shortage has not been institution-wide but is concentrated in specialty care areas, particularly intensive care units and operating rooms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The shortage of registered nurses in intensive care units is explained in part by the sharp decline in the number of younger registered nurses, whom intensive care units have historically attracted. Shortages in operating rooms probably reflect that many registered nurses who work in this setting are reaching the age when they are beginning to reduce their hours worked or are retiring altogether.</p><p>Major variations occur in the number of health care workers per capita population and in the skill mix employed across countries, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor ratio varies widely from one country to another, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor skill mix is important and may have consequences for the respective tasks of nurses and doctors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that these variations are taking place among countries with a relatively similar economic development level.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of physicians, nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists in selected countries. WHO data, 2000.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-2\"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Geographical imbalances</title><p>Virtually all countries suffer from a geographical maldistribution of human resources for health, and the primary area of concern is usually the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In both industrialized and developing countries, urban areas almost invariably have a substantially higher concentration of physicians than rural areas.</p><p>Understandably, most health care professionals prefer to settle in urban areas, which offer opportunities for professional development as well as education and other amenities for themselves and their families. But it is in the rural and remote areas, especially in the developing countries, that most severe public health problems are found.</p><p>The geographical maldistribution of doctors has been the object of particular attention. In general there is a higher concentration of general practitioners in the inner suburbs of the metropolitan areas. According to the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>], the reasons for high concentration of general practitioners in inner city areas are:</p><p>&#x02022; historical</p><p>&#x02022; lifestyle-related: access to amenities</p><p>&#x02022; spouse/husband-related: greater employment opportunities</p><p>&#x02022; child-related: better access to secondary and tertiary education services</p><p>&#x02022; professional, family and social ties and professional ambitions.</p><p>The geographical distribution of health care personnel is an important issue in many countries. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, contains one-fifth of the country's population but around half of the available health personnel [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>]. In Bangladesh, most of the doctors (35%) and nurses (30%) in health services are located in four metropolitan districts where only 14.5% of the population lives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B70\">70</xref>]. This concentration pattern is characteristic of developing countries.</p><p>In Indonesia the geographical distribution of physicians is a particular concern, since Indonesia's vast size and difficult geography present a tremendous challenge to health service delivery [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B71\">71</xref>]. It is difficult to place doctors in remote islands or mountain or forest locations with few amenities, no opportunities for private practice, and poor communications with the rest of the country.</p><p>To improve the geographical distribution of physicians, governments often have used combinations of compulsory service and incentives. So far, there is virtually no country in the world that has solved the problem of a rural/urban imbalance of the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. This does not necessarily mean that policies and programmes designed to reduce the imbalance have had no effect. For example, Thailand has successfully begun to stem the migration of health professionals from rural to urban areas and from public to private facilities with a range of strong financial incentives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B72\">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Institutional and services imbalances</title><p>Institutional imbalances occur when some health care facilities have too many staff because of prestige, working conditions, ability to generate additional income, or other situation-specific factors, while others are understaffed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B73\">73</xref>]. Institutions such as magnet hospitals, for example, are hospitals characterized by adequate to excellent staffing, low turnover, rich nursing skill mix and greater job satisfaction, among other factors, even in the face of a general health personnel shortage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B74\">74</xref>].</p><p>Imbalance between the types of health services provided may also arise. In particular, we can consider the issue of curative versus preventive care. In effect, it has been estimated that most diseases (80%) and accidents are preventable through known methodologies, yet at present there is an imbalance in the funding of medical research, with only 1%-2% going to prevention and 98%-99% spent on curative approaches [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B75\">75</xref>]. This imbalance in funding raises the question of a health workforce imbalance between preventive and curative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Gender imbalances</title><p>In many countries, women still tend to concentrate in the lower-status health occupations and to be a minority among more highly trained professionals and managers. In Bangladesh, the distribution by gender of the health workforce shows that the total proportion of women accounts for little more than one-fifth in health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>]. The distribution of women by occupational category is biased in favour of nurses. Women are very poorly represented in other categories, such as dentists, medical assistants, pharmacists, managers/trainers and doctors. The underrepresentation of women in managerial and decision-making positions may lead to less attention to and poorer understanding of the problems specific to women and the particularities of their utilization patterns [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B77\">77</xref>].</p><p>Female general practitioners have been shown to practise differently from males, managing different types of medical conditions, with some differences due to patient mix and patient selectivity, and others inherent in the sex of physician. In some more traditional areas, some women will not seek care for themselves or even for their children because they do not have access to a female provider [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This framework can be used to assess policy reforms and their impact on health workforce imbalances; it also provides a common framework for cross-country comparisons. This framework emphasizes the number and type of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, illustrating the complexity of this issue. From a policy perspective, it is particularly interesting to identify factors that policy-makers can influence in order to remedy imbalance problems.</p><p>Various monetary and non-monetary incentives are used to influence the supply and/or demand for the health workforce. For example, subsidies, grants and scholarships are examples of incentives that can be used to attract more nursing students, whereas wage increases, additional benefits and working hours flexibility are examples of commonly used incentives to attract or retain the health workforce.</p><p>The numerous factors and actors involved in the health workforce imbalance issue call for a coherent health workforce vision and policy. In that context, health planning plays an important role since it contributes to shaping the health care system. Moreover, since from a societal perspective market mechanisms alone do not allow an adequate demand/supply of health personnel to be reached, public interventions such as human resources planning are a means to correct for market failures. Health planning involves a time horizon. Forecasting the future number of health personnel needed and developing policies to meet such figures are common to any health care system. Physicians represent the profession for which more planning effort has been expended to achieve a workforce of appropriate size than for any other health profession. Countries' desire to meet population health needs and to avoid social welfare losses resulting from a shortage or an oversupply are factors explaining, to a large extent, the importance attributed to planning in the context of public health policies.</p><p>The policy implications of forecasting either a shortage or a surplus of health care personnel are different, and hence attempts at projections must be rigorous. For instance, referring to previous studies predicting significant surpluses, Cooper [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B78\">78</xref>] notes that such large surpluses have not occurred so far, because of a decrease in physician work effort. Factors such as age, sex and lifestyle contributed to this evolution.</p><p>As a result of forecasted physician surpluses, various policy recommendations have been formulated. The United States Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B79\">79</xref>] published a report recommending, among other things, that there be no new medical schools, that existing schools should not increase their class size and that the number of first-year residency positions should be reduced. The Pew Health Professions Commission Report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B80\">80</xref>] issued a report recommending more severe steps, such as the closing of some medical schools and tightening the visa process for international medical graduates.</p><p>This framework also apprehends the different types of imbalances. This is important since the choice of a policy will also depend on the type of imbalance. Significant disparities in human resources for health between health occupation, regions, gender or health services are recognized as classic problems of imbalance. However, the question of a public/private imbalance is more debatable. One the one hand, we can argue that for equity and access, a health care system should have a strong public component. On the other hand, we can imagine a private-sector oriented health care system with mechanisms to ensure access to the poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of imbalances in the health workforce, this paper has discussed a framework for human resources for health and proposed a typology of imbalances. Although the term \"imbalance\" is commonly used with respect to the health workforce, it is clear that imbalance in the health workforce encompasses a wide range of possible situations and is a complex issue. The use of a framework should facilitate the development of policy tools and their assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'

While they mention that vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna provide immunization against COVID-19, they do not elaborate on the mechanisms through which vaccines interact with the immune system.\n\nIn general, vaccines work by mimicking an infection and stimulating the immune system to recognize and respond to pathogens without causing the disease. Here's a brief overview of the process:\n\n1. **Antigen Presentation**: Vaccines contain antigens (parts of the virus or bacteria, such as proteins or inactivated forms) that are recognized by the immune system. These antigens are introduced into the body through vaccination.\n\n2. **Immune Response Activation**: The immune system responds to these antigens by activating various immune cells, including T cells and B cells. T cells can help kill infected cells or coordinate the immune response, while B cells produce antibodies that can neutralize pathogens.\n\n3. **Memory Formation**: After the initial immune response, the immune system creates memory cells that \"remember\" the specific antigens. If the body encounters the actual pathogen in the future, these memory cells can quickly mount a robust immune response, often preventing illness.\n\nTo fully answer the question, additional information on the mechanisms of vaccine action, such as the role of specific immune cells and the types of immune responses elicited (humoral and cellular immunity), would be beneficial.",

It is a complex issue that encompasses a wide range of possible situations. This paper aims to contribute not only to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature, but also to the development of an analytical framework. The framework emphasizes the number and types of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, and facilitates the development of policy tools and their assessment. Moreover, to facilitate comparisons between health workforce imbalances, a typology of imbalances is proposed that differentiates between profession/specialty imbalances, geographical imbalances, institutional and services imbalances and gender imbalances.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Imbalance in the health workforce is a major challenge for health policy-makers, since human resources &#x02013; the different kinds of clinical and non-clinical staff who make each individual and public health intervention happen &#x02013; are the most important of the health system's inputs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. Imbalance is not a new issue, as nursing shortages were reported in hospitals in the United States of America as early as 1915 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. It remains a major concern to this day, reported in both developed and developing countries and for most of the health care professions.</p><p>Although imbalance in the health workforce is an important issue for policy-makers, various elements contribute to obscuring policy development. First, many reports of shortages are not borne out by the evidence. Rosenfeld and Moses [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] show that an overwhelming majority of newspapers, journals and newsletter articles describing the nursing situation in the United States presume the existence of a shortage. They found that even in those areas where concrete evidence of a shortage was not available, the term \"nursing shortage\" still appeared. Second, the notion of shortage is a relative one: what is considered a nursing shortage in Europe would probably be viewed differently from an African perspective. Finally, imbalances are of different types and their impact on the health care system varies. In consequence, there is a general need to critically review the imbalance issue.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature and the development of an analytical framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition</title><p>There are various approaches to defining imbalances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. From an economic perspective, a skill imbalance (shortage/surplus) occurs when the quantity of a given skill supplied by the workforce and the quantity demanded by employers diverge at the existing market conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Labour market supplies and demands for occupational skills fluctuate continuously, so at times there will be imbalances in the labour market. In other words, a shortage/surplus is the result of a disequilibrium between the demand and supply for labour. In contrast, non-economic definitions are usually normative, i.e. there is a shortage of labour relative to defined norms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. In the case of health personnel, these definitions are based either on a value judgement &#x02013; for instance, how much care people should receive &#x02013; or on a professional determination &#x02013; such as deciding what is the appropriate number of physicians for the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature</title><p>One of the key questions regarding imbalances is how long these last: Is the imbalance temporary or permanent? In a competitive labour market, we should expect most imbalances to be resolved over time. Imbalances will tend to disappear faster the greater the reaction speed and also the greater the elasticity of supply (or demand) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. This type of imbalance (shortage or surplus) is defined as dynamic.</p><p>In contrast, a static imbalance occurs because supply does not increase or decrease; market equilibrium is therefore not achieved. For instance, wage adjustments may respond slowly to shifts in demand or supply as a result of institutional and regulatory arrangements, imperfect market competition (monopoly, monopsony) and wage-control policies. Another example is physicians' education: because of the length of time required to educate physicians, changes in available supply take a long time to react significantly. Lack of information on the state of the various labour markets can also be a factor in the speed of market adjustment. To make proper labour market decisions, households and firms must be informed of the existing market conditions across markets. They must therefore know what wages are paid and the nature and location of job openings and available workers.</p><p>Moreover, we should also differentiate between qualitative and quantitative imbalance. In a tight labour market, employers might not find the ideal candidate, but will still recruit someone. Under these conditions, the issue is the quality of job candidates rather than the quantity of people willing and able to do the job [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. From the employers' perspective, a shortage of workers exists; from the job-market perspective, the existence of a shortage could be questioned because the jobs are filled. One negative hidden impact of a qualitative shortage is the number of positions that are filled with ineffective individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A conceptual framework</title><p>To better understand the role of factors affecting health workforce imbalances and to facilitate the development of policy tools, a conceptual framework is presented in this section.</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Factors affecting health workforce imbalances are numerous and complex, but focusing on crucial elements should permit insight into the issue of health workforce imbalances. The framework is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> and contains six main components: the demand for health labour, the supply of health labour, the health care system, policies, resources and \"global\" factors.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Framework for imbalance of human resources for health</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-1\"/></fig><p>Central to this framework are the demand for and supply of health labour. Also included in the framework is the health care system, and in particular, some of its features that are likely to have an impact on health workforce imbalances. Policies constitute another crucial element of the framework. In effect, health policies but also non-health-oriented policies can have an impact on health workforce imbalances. The framework also incorporates financial, physical and knowledge resources that contribute to model the health workforce.Finally, \"global\" factors such as economic, sociodemographic, political, geographical and cultural factors are included. These elements contribute directly or indirectly to shaping and transforming the entire society and hence the health workforce.</p></sec><sec><title>The demand for health personnel</title><p>The first element of the framework to be examined is the demand for health personnel. The demand for health personnel can be considered as a derived demand for health services. Accordingly, we should consider factors determining the demand for health services. Personal characteristics &#x02013; such as health needs, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics &#x02013; and economic factors play an important role.</p><p>It has often been proposed that the planning of human resources for health be based solely on estimates of health needs in the population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. However, relying only on the concept of need is difficult, because it can be defined either broadly or restrictedly and accordingly lead to a perception of either systematic shortage or surplus. Health needs is only one of the factors affecting the demand for health personnel.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of economic factors on the demand for health care. In particular in the United States, studies have attempted to estimate price and income elasticities of demand for medical services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. Measurements of price or income elasticities make it possible to evaluate the impact of a change in price or income on the demand for health care. Most studies reported elasticities in the range between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating that consumers tend to be responsive to price changes but that the degree of price sensitivity is not very large compared to that for many other goods and services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>Another element influencing the demand for health care is the value of a patient's time, such as travel time and waiting time. Acton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] found that in the United States, elasticity of demand with respect to travel time ranged between -0.6 and -1, meaning that a 10% increase in travel time would induce a reduction of 6%-10% in the demand for health care.</p><p>Other factors affect the demand for health labour. In particular, some specific features of the health care system and its features, policies, resources and environmental factors do have an impact on the demand for health labour. Their respective role will further discussed later.</p></sec><sec><title>The supply of human resources for health</title><p>After reviewing factors affecting the demand for health labour, we shall now turn to those affecting the supply of the health workforce. In particular, we shall consider the following elements: factors affecting the choice for a health professional training/education, participation in the health labour market and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Education/professional training choice</title><p>The availability of a renewed health workforce, as well as the type of profession and specialty chosen by individuals, is a major concern for health decision-makers. These issues are of particular relevance, especially since the number of younger people, predominantly women, choosing a nursing career is declining in some countries and since in professional training/education, individuals' choices do not always match the absorptive capacity of the market.</p><p>From an economic perspective, the decision to undertake professional training/education is considered an investment decision. To emphasize the essential similarities of these investments to other kinds of investments, economists refer to them as investment in human capital [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. Since investment decisions usually deliver payoffs over time, we must consider the entire stream of costs and benefits. The expected returns on human capital investments are a higher level of earnings, greater job satisfaction over one's lifetime and a greater appreciation of non-market activities and interests.</p><p>Based on the human capital approach, rate of return on education can be estimated. An average rate of return that is high and rising for a given profession will attract more individuals to that profession. On the other hand, a lower and decreasing average rate of return will discourage individuals from choosing that profession. Nowak and Preston [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], using the human capital approach, found that Australian nurses are poorly paid in comparison to other female professionals. The declining interest in nursing can be partly explained by the expansion of career opportunities in traditionally male-dominated occupations over the last three decades that entail a higher rate of return [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The number of young women entering the registered-nurse workforce has declined because many women who would have entered nursing in the past &#x02013; particularly those with high academic ability &#x02013; are now entering managerial and professional occupations that used to be traditionally male.</p><p>Besides the human capital approach, the choice of a profession can also be explained by sociopsychological factors. For instance, individuals may choose a profession because it is highly valued by the society or for family tradition. In the health sector, the satisfaction afforded by caring for people and assisting them to improve their health is an important element used by nursing schools to attract new enrollees. In the light of this approach, the decline in the number of individuals choosing nursing as a career might also be explained by the fact that this profession is now less socially valued than before [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participation in the labour market</title><p>The economic theory of the decision to work views the decision as a choice concerning how people spend their time. Individuals face a trade-off between labour and leisure. They decide how much of their time to spend working for pay or participating in leisure activities, the latter being activities that are not work-related.</p><p>An issue that has drawn a lot of attention recently is the impact of wage increases on labour participation, in particular for nurses. In the short term, higher wages can have at least two effects on the labour supply of current qualified nurses: first, qualified nurses who are working in other occupations may return to nursing activities; second, nurses now in practice may respond by working more hours. In the long run, higher wages in nursing relative to other occupations make nursing an attractive profession and will draw more people into nurse training programmes.</p><p>In their literature review of wage elasticity of nursing labour supply, Antonazzo et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] and Chiha and Link [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] found that most of the studies indicate a positive relationship, although not a strong one, between wages and labour supply. Accordingly, increases in nursing wages are unlikely to cause significant increases in labour participation. A literature review on the women's workforce undertaken by Killingsworth and Heckman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] indicated that in addition to wage rate, women's participation is responsive to changes in unearned income, spouse's wage and having children (particularly of pre-school age). Another aspect of labour supply decisions that has been investigated by Philips [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] is the costs associated with entering the nursing labour market (such as costs of child care and housework). The elasticity of participation with respect to changes in working costs was evaluated at -0.67 for all nurses. This suggests that a subsidy leading to a decrease of 10% in these costs would increase the participation of nurses by 6.7%.</p><p>Moreover, hospitals are also using a variety of strategies to recruit new staff. A survey of hospitals in the United States shows that richer benefits, such as health insurance and vacation time, are the most common incentives used. In addition, hospitals may offer other recruitment and retention benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, flexible hours and signing bonuses based on experience or length of commitment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. Many countries, but particularly developed ones, use such incentives to recruit new staff.</p><p>Economic factors also play a role in physician's participation in the labour market, as demonstrated by the impact of cost-containment policies in Canada, where most provincial governments have implemented an assortment of controls of health care expenses. Threshold reductions were introduced, so that fees payable to individual physicians were reduced as billing exceeded an agreed threshold. As a consequence, physicians who had billed at the threshold level chose to take leaves of absence rather than receive a level of reimbursement they considered inadequate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>].</p><p>When health personnel choose an alternative or additional occupation, this is likely to have consequences on health labour supply. In developing countries, and particularly in Africa, attempts to reform the health care sector have frequently failed to respond to the aspirations of staff concerning remuneration and working conditions. Salaries are often inadequate and may be paid late, and health workers try to solve their financial problems in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Private practice is only one of the many survival strategies that health personnel use to supplement their income and increase their job satisfaction. Teaching, attending training courses, supervision activities, research, trade and agriculture are some of these alternative strategies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Labour market exit</title><p>Parker and Rickam [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] examined the economic determinants of the labour force withdrawal of registered nurses in the United States, i.e. nurses leaving the profession to pursue a non-nursing occupation and employed nurses withdrawing from the labour force. Their results suggest that a significant number of registered nurses withdraw, at least temporarily, from the labour force. Among the significant elements influencing the withdrawal decision are the wage rate, other family income, presence of children and full-time/part-time work status. Increasing registered nurses' wages and working full-time is expected to reduce the probability of labour force withdrawal, whereas higher education levels, age and other family income increase the probability of labour force withdrawal.</p><p>The relative importance of wage is also emphasized by studies investigating job satisfaction. There is support in the empirical literature for the existence of job dissatisfaction among nurses, and the link between job dissatisfaction and job exit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]. In the United States the most important factors in nurses' resignation were, in order of importance: workload, staffing, time with patients, flexible scheduling, respect from nursing administration, increasing nursing knowledge, promotion opportunities, work stimulation, salary and decision-making. These studies suggest that salary is just one of the reasons why nurses are quitting. The relative importance of wage is confirmed by Shields and Ward [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]. Their results suggest that dissatisfaction with promotion and training opportunities has a stronger impact than workload or pay.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration</title><p>Migration of health personnel can have a serious impact on the supply of human resources in health, because it may exacerbate health personnel imbalances in \"sending\" countries. It is suggested that migration is an \"individual, spontaneous and voluntary act\" that is motivated by the perceived net gain of migrating &#x02013; that is, the gain will offset the tangible and intangible costs of moving [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Decisions to migrate are often a family strategy to produce a better income and improve survival chances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>The reality for many health workers in developing countries is to be underpaid, poorly motivated and increasingly dissatisfied and sceptical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. The relevance of motivation to migration is self-evident. There can be little doubt that for many health workers an improvement in pay and conditions will act as an incentive to stay in the country. Improved pensions, child care, educational opportunities and recognition are also known to be important [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. In Ghana it is estimated that only 191 of the 489 doctors who graduated between 1985 and 1994 were still working in the country in 1997 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Health system characteristics</title><p>As the health workforce is part of the health care system, we shall also consider features of the health care system that are likely to have an impact on the demand and supply of health labour. In particular, we shall examine market failures, the diversity of stakeholders, the supply-demand adjustment time lag and hospitals' potential monopsony power.</p></sec><sec><title>Market failures</title><p>From an economic perspective, the health care market is characterized by market failures &#x02013; that is, the assumptions for perfect competition are violated. From a societal perspective, in the presence of market failures such as externalities &#x02013; imperfect knowledge, asymmetry of information and uncertainty &#x02013; market mechanisms lead to a non-optimal demand and/or supply in health services. In other words, shortages and surpluses are likely to result from the health care market.</p><p>Most markets are characterized by market failures, but what is unique to the health services market is the extent of these market failures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Governments try to correct health care market failures through policy interventions. A classic example of public intervention in the presence of a positive externality is the introduction of a policy of mandatory vaccination. However, implementing such policies is sometimes difficult and may result in only partial correction of the market failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Stakeholders</title><p>The health care system is characterized by a wide range of institutional stakeholders involved in shaping human resources for health, all of whom may have different objectives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. The objectives of a union or professional association do not necessarily coincide, for example, with those of a government ministry, a hospital manager or the central government. Unions/professional associations seek to increase their members' market power, employment and income [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], whereas the ministry of finance will want more budget equilibrium and will favour measures to limit health care expenditures.</p><p>In the case of Mozambique, whereas the policy of employing national professionals by cooperation agencies has met with warm support from national cadres, its effect on the health sector is problematic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. The prospect of immediate financial gains puts pressure on qualified professionals to leave their posts within the Mozambique National Health Service to take up management or consultant positions. The substantial investment in their training is therefore producing dubious direct returns to the National Health Service. More seriously perhaps, the presence of donor-paid jobs outside the health sector (as programme coordinators, researchers, etc.) is creating pressure on the Ministry of Health itself, exacerbating the imbalances in the National Health Service and creating incentives for trained Mozambicans to leave the public sector.</p></sec><sec><title>Time lag</title><p>Moreover, adjustments between the demand and supply for health personnel may take a long time. In the health care field; the time lag between education and practising may be quite substantial. To obtain licensure to practise medicine requires lengthy education and training, and the long lag time between a changed student intake and a change in supply has been noted [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]: supply adjustment for physicians is not immediate, but takes a long time.</p></sec><sec><title>Hospitals' potential monopsony power</title><p>A single entity that is the sole purchaser of labour is a <italic>monopsony</italic>. One example is the potential monopsony power of hospitals in hiring nurses or the ministry of health in hiring the health workforce. The amount of labour demanded will influence the price the monopsonist must pay for it. In contrast to the situation in a competitive market, the monopsony is a price maker, not a price taker. Monopsony results in lower wages and lower employment of nurses compared to a competitive market.</p><p>A number of studies have tested whether or not hospitals possess monopsony power with respect to nurses, and the results are contradictory. Sullivan [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>] and Staiger et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>] concluded that hospitals have a substantial degree of monopsony power. In contrast, Hirsch and Schumacher [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>] did not find empirical support for the monopsony model. Nurses' wages were found not to be related to hospital density and to decrease rather than increase with respect to labour market size.</p></sec><sec><title>Provider power/monopoly</title><p>In contrast, providers' power may enable the latter to restrict the supply of human resources for health. Seldon, Jung and Cavazos [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such avenues as restricting supply and price-fixing. In France, trade unions are granted an institutional role at establishment level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. In India and Sri Lanka, a clear constraint to support-services contracting was the inability to counter the power of the public service unions in dictating employment terms and conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. The varying degree of homogeneity of the different professional groups may also explain their relative success in maintaining a monopoly of practice. In Iceland, one of the factors that contributed to breaking the professional monopoly of pharmacists was division within the profession [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Regulations</title><p>The type off regulation associated with a profession plays an important role regarding the supply of members of a profession. Regulation has, by tradition, been achieved through a combination of direct government regulation and, to a large extent, through rules adopted by professional associations, whose self-regulatory powers enable them to establish both entry requirements and rules regarding professional conduct [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>].</p><p>Such barriers to entry exist in particular for doctors, but also in other health professions, such as dentistry. Some argue that these barriers constitute a means to limit entry into the profession, and hence maintain high incomes. Muzondo and Pazderka [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] established, for Canadian professional licensing restrictions, a relationship between different variables of self-regulation and higher income. Seldon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such sources as restricting supply and price-fixing. However, the proponents of self-regulation claim that these barriers are a means to provide health care of quality and to protect patients from incompetent providers. In contrast, although most countries have a professional nursing association, nurses tend to have limited power to regulate entry to the profession. This could be associated with a large diversity of specialist groups in nursing failing to unite on issues related to professional regulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Health and non-health policies</title><p>Health and non-health policies contribute to shaping the health care system and have an influence on the demand and supply of health labour.</p><p>Health policy can be defined as a formal statement or procedure within institutions (notably government) that defines priorities and the parameters for action in response to health needs, available resources and other political pressures. Health policy is often enacted through legislation or other forms of rule-making that create regulations and incentives for providing health services and programmes and access to them. For instance, the decision to introduce or expand health insurance coverage is likely to have an impact on the demand for health services. This is illustrated by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, a controlled experiment that increased knowledge about the effect of different insurance copayments on use of medical services. Insurance copayments ranged from zero to 95%. The RAND study concluded that as the co-insurance rose, overall use and expenditure fell for adults and children combined [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>].</p><p>Non-health policies reflect state interventions in areas such as employment, education and regional development that contribute to shaping the health workforce. These policies do not directly address health issues, but have an indirect impact on such issues. In France, a controversial new regulation was introduced that reduced the workweek to a maximum of 35 hours in an attempt both to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and to achieve greater flexibility in the labour force. Unions responded by demanding the creation of more posts in public hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial, physical and knowledge resources</title><p>Financial, physical and knowledge resources are crucial to any type of health care workforce. The level of resources attributed to the health care system, and how these resources are used, will have a significant impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>In terms of financial resources, human resources account for a high proportion of national budgets assigned to the health sector [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Health expenditure claims an increasingly important share of the gross domestic product and, in most countries, wage costs (salaries, bonuses and other payments) are estimated to account for between 65% and 80% of the renewable health system expenditure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>].</p><p>Physical resources include human resources within the health sector and other sectors; buildings and engineering services such as sanitation, water and heating systems for community use and for the use of medical care institutions; and equipment and supplies. Finally, the health workforce is also constrained by its human capital. This human capital can be associated with the qualification and education of the health workforce. Education of the health workforce is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given in preparation for work.</p></sec><sec><title>Global factors</title><p>Economic, sociodemographic, cultural, and geographical factors contribute to shaping and transforming society and hence have a direct or indirect impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>From an economic perspective, for instance, there is evidence of a correlation between the level of economic development of a country and its level of human resources for health. Countries with higher GDP per capita are said to spend more on health care than countries with lower income, as demonstrated by cross-sectional studies, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>] and hence would also tend to have larger health workforces.</p><p>Moreover, both the demand and supply are likely to be affected by sociodemographic elements such as the age distribution of the population. On the demand side, the ageing of the population is giving rise to an increase in the demand for health services and health personnel, especially nurses for home care.</p><p>On the supply side, the ageing of the health workforce, and in particular of nurses, has serious implications for the future of the nursing labour market. For example, the Institute of Medicine noted that older registered nurses have a reduced capacity to perform certain tasks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. It was found that between 1983 and 1998 the average age of practising registered nurses increased by more than four years, from 37.4 to 41.9 years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. In contrast, the average age of the United States workforce as a whole increased by less than two years during the same period. Furthermore, the proportion of the registered-nurse workforce younger than 30 years decreased from 30.3% to 12.1% during this period.</p><p>Geographical and cultural factors also play a role in determining the demand and supply of human resources. Geographical characteristics affect the organization of health services delivery. For instance, a country with many islands or with isolated population groups will face particular challenges in terms of health workforce issues. Similarly, significant climatic changes are likely to give rise to changes in health needs, which in turn will call for changes in health services and in the health workforce. Finally, both cultural and political values also affect the demand for and supply of human resources for health.</p></sec><sec><title>Health workforce imbalances: a typology</title><p>This section considers a typology of imbalances, and differentiates between the following:</p><p>&#x02022; Profession/specialty imbalances: Under this category, we consider imbalance in the various health professions, such as doctors or nurses, as well as shortages within a profession, e.g. shortage of one type of specialists.</p><p>&#x02022; Geographical imbalances: These are disparities between urban and rural regions and poor and rich regions.</p><p>&#x02022; Institutional and services imbalances: These are differences in health workforce supply between health care facilities, as well as between services.</p><p>&#x02022; Gender imbalances: These are disparities in female/male representation in the health workforce.</p><sec><title>Profession/specialty imbalances</title><p>Imbalances have been reported for almost all health professions, and in particular for nurses. The United States General Accounting Office [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>] reports a nursing shortage. However, the nursing shortage has not been institution-wide but is concentrated in specialty care areas, particularly intensive care units and operating rooms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The shortage of registered nurses in intensive care units is explained in part by the sharp decline in the number of younger registered nurses, whom intensive care units have historically attracted. Shortages in operating rooms probably reflect that many registered nurses who work in this setting are reaching the age when they are beginning to reduce their hours worked or are retiring altogether.</p><p>Major variations occur in the number of health care workers per capita population and in the skill mix employed across countries, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor ratio varies widely from one country to another, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor skill mix is important and may have consequences for the respective tasks of nurses and doctors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that these variations are taking place among countries with a relatively similar economic development level.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of physicians, nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists in selected countries. WHO data, 2000.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-2\"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Geographical imbalances</title><p>Virtually all countries suffer from a geographical maldistribution of human resources for health, and the primary area of concern is usually the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In both industrialized and developing countries, urban areas almost invariably have a substantially higher concentration of physicians than rural areas.</p><p>Understandably, most health care professionals prefer to settle in urban areas, which offer opportunities for professional development as well as education and other amenities for themselves and their families. But it is in the rural and remote areas, especially in the developing countries, that most severe public health problems are found.</p><p>The geographical maldistribution of doctors has been the object of particular attention. In general there is a higher concentration of general practitioners in the inner suburbs of the metropolitan areas. According to the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>], the reasons for high concentration of general practitioners in inner city areas are:</p><p>&#x02022; historical</p><p>&#x02022; lifestyle-related: access to amenities</p><p>&#x02022; spouse/husband-related: greater employment opportunities</p><p>&#x02022; child-related: better access to secondary and tertiary education services</p><p>&#x02022; professional, family and social ties and professional ambitions.</p><p>The geographical distribution of health care personnel is an important issue in many countries. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, contains one-fifth of the country's population but around half of the available health personnel [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>]. In Bangladesh, most of the doctors (35%) and nurses (30%) in health services are located in four metropolitan districts where only 14.5% of the population lives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B70\">70</xref>]. This concentration pattern is characteristic of developing countries.</p><p>In Indonesia the geographical distribution of physicians is a particular concern, since Indonesia's vast size and difficult geography present a tremendous challenge to health service delivery [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B71\">71</xref>]. It is difficult to place doctors in remote islands or mountain or forest locations with few amenities, no opportunities for private practice, and poor communications with the rest of the country.</p><p>To improve the geographical distribution of physicians, governments often have used combinations of compulsory service and incentives. So far, there is virtually no country in the world that has solved the problem of a rural/urban imbalance of the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. This does not necessarily mean that policies and programmes designed to reduce the imbalance have had no effect. For example, Thailand has successfully begun to stem the migration of health professionals from rural to urban areas and from public to private facilities with a range of strong financial incentives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B72\">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Institutional and services imbalances</title><p>Institutional imbalances occur when some health care facilities have too many staff because of prestige, working conditions, ability to generate additional income, or other situation-specific factors, while others are understaffed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B73\">73</xref>]. Institutions such as magnet hospitals, for example, are hospitals characterized by adequate to excellent staffing, low turnover, rich nursing skill mix and greater job satisfaction, among other factors, even in the face of a general health personnel shortage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B74\">74</xref>].</p><p>Imbalance between the types of health services provided may also arise. In particular, we can consider the issue of curative versus preventive care. In effect, it has been estimated that most diseases (80%) and accidents are preventable through known methodologies, yet at present there is an imbalance in the funding of medical research, with only 1%-2% going to prevention and 98%-99% spent on curative approaches [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B75\">75</xref>]. This imbalance in funding raises the question of a health workforce imbalance between preventive and curative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Gender imbalances</title><p>In many countries, women still tend to concentrate in the lower-status health occupations and to be a minority among more highly trained professionals and managers. In Bangladesh, the distribution by gender of the health workforce shows that the total proportion of women accounts for little more than one-fifth in health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>]. The distribution of women by occupational category is biased in favour of nurses. Women are very poorly represented in other categories, such as dentists, medical assistants, pharmacists, managers/trainers and doctors. The underrepresentation of women in managerial and decision-making positions may lead to less attention to and poorer understanding of the problems specific to women and the particularities of their utilization patterns [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B77\">77</xref>].</p><p>Female general practitioners have been shown to practise differently from males, managing different types of medical conditions, with some differences due to patient mix and patient selectivity, and others inherent in the sex of physician. In some more traditional areas, some women will not seek care for themselves or even for their children because they do not have access to a female provider [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This framework can be used to assess policy reforms and their impact on health workforce imbalances; it also provides a common framework for cross-country comparisons. This framework emphasizes the number and type of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, illustrating the complexity of this issue. From a policy perspective, it is particularly interesting to identify factors that policy-makers can influence in order to remedy imbalance problems.</p><p>Various monetary and non-monetary incentives are used to influence the supply and/or demand for the health workforce. For example, subsidies, grants and scholarships are examples of incentives that can be used to attract more nursing students, whereas wage increases, additional benefits and working hours flexibility are examples of commonly used incentives to attract or retain the health workforce.</p><p>The numerous factors and actors involved in the health workforce imbalance issue call for a coherent health workforce vision and policy. In that context, health planning plays an important role since it contributes to shaping the health care system. Moreover, since from a societal perspective market mechanisms alone do not allow an adequate demand/supply of health personnel to be reached, public interventions such as human resources planning are a means to correct for market failures. Health planning involves a time horizon. Forecasting the future number of health personnel needed and developing policies to meet such figures are common to any health care system. Physicians represent the profession for which more planning effort has been expended to achieve a workforce of appropriate size than for any other health profession. Countries' desire to meet population health needs and to avoid social welfare losses resulting from a shortage or an oversupply are factors explaining, to a large extent, the importance attributed to planning in the context of public health policies.</p><p>The policy implications of forecasting either a shortage or a surplus of health care personnel are different, and hence attempts at projections must be rigorous. For instance, referring to previous studies predicting significant surpluses, Cooper [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B78\">78</xref>] notes that such large surpluses have not occurred so far, because of a decrease in physician work effort. Factors such as age, sex and lifestyle contributed to this evolution.</p><p>As a result of forecasted physician surpluses, various policy recommendations have been formulated. The United States Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B79\">79</xref>] published a report recommending, among other things, that there be no new medical schools, that existing schools should not increase their class size and that the number of first-year residency positions should be reduced. The Pew Health Professions Commission Report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B80\">80</xref>] issued a report recommending more severe steps, such as the closing of some medical schools and tightening the visa process for international medical graduates.</p><p>This framework also apprehends the different types of imbalances. This is important since the choice of a policy will also depend on the type of imbalance. Significant disparities in human resources for health between health occupation, regions, gender or health services are recognized as classic problems of imbalance. However, the question of a public/private imbalance is more debatable. One the one hand, we can argue that for equity and access, a health care system should have a strong public component. On the other hand, we can imagine a private-sector oriented health care system with mechanisms to ensure access to the poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of imbalances in the health workforce, this paper has discussed a framework for human resources for health and proposed a typology of imbalances. Although the term \"imbalance\" is commonly used with respect to the health workforce, it is clear that imbalance in the health workforce encompasses a wide range of possible situations and is a complex issue. The use of a framework should facilitate the development of policy tools and their assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'

Imbalance is not a new issue, as nursing shortages were reported in hospitals in the United States of America as early as 1915 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. It remains a major concern to this day, reported in both developed and developing countries and for most of the health care professions.</p><p>Although imbalance in the health workforce is an important issue for policy-makers, various elements contribute to obscuring policy development. First, many reports of shortages are not borne out by the evidence. Rosenfeld and Moses [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] show that an overwhelming majority of newspapers, journals and newsletter articles describing the nursing situation in the United States presume the existence of a shortage. They found that even in those areas where concrete evidence of a shortage was not available, the term \"nursing shortage\" still appeared. Second, the notion of shortage is a relative one: what is considered a nursing shortage in Europe would probably be viewed differently from an African perspective. Finally, imbalances are of different types and their impact on the health care system varies. In consequence, there is a general need to critically review the imbalance issue.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature and the development of an analytical framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition</title><p>There are various approaches to defining imbalances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. From an economic perspective, a skill imbalance (shortage/surplus) occurs when the quantity of a given skill supplied by the workforce and the quantity demanded by employers diverge at the existing market conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Labour market supplies and demands for occupational skills fluctuate continuously, so at times there will be imbalances in the labour market. In other words, a shortage/surplus is the result of a disequilibrium between the demand and supply for labour. In contrast, non-economic definitions are usually normative, i.e. there is a shortage of labour relative to defined norms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. In the case of health personnel, these definitions are based either on a value judgement &#x02013; for instance, how much care people should receive &#x02013; or on a professional determination &#x02013; such as deciding what is the appropriate number of physicians for the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature</title><p>One of the key questions regarding imbalances is how long these last: Is the imbalance temporary or permanent? In a competitive labour market, we should expect most imbalances to be resolved over time. Imbalances will tend to disappear faster the greater the reaction speed and also the greater the elasticity of supply (or demand) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. This type of imbalance (shortage or surplus) is defined as dynamic.</p><p>In contrast, a static imbalance occurs because supply does not increase or decrease; market equilibrium is therefore not achieved. For instance, wage adjustments may respond slowly to shifts in demand or supply as a result of institutional and regulatory arrangements, imperfect market competition (monopoly, monopsony) and wage-control policies. Another example is physicians' education: because of the length of time required to educate physicians, changes in available supply take a long time to react significantly. Lack of information on the state of the various labour markets can also be a factor in the speed of market adjustment. To make proper labour market decisions, households and firms must be informed of the existing market conditions across markets. They must therefore know what wages are paid and the nature and location of job openings and available workers.</p><p>Moreover, we should also differentiate between qualitative and quantitative imbalance. In a tight labour market, employers might not find the ideal candidate, but will still recruit someone. Under these conditions, the issue is the quality of job candidates rather than the quantity of people willing and able to do the job [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. From the employers' perspective, a shortage of workers exists; from the job-market perspective, the existence of a shortage could be questioned because the jobs are filled. One negative hidden impact of a qualitative shortage is the number of positions that are filled with ineffective individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A conceptual framework</title><p>To better understand the role of factors affecting health workforce imbalances and to facilitate the development of policy tools, a conceptual framework is presented in this section.</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Factors affecting health workforce imbalances are numerous and complex, but focusing on crucial elements should permit insight into the issue of health workforce imbalances. The framework is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> and contains six main components: the demand for health labour, the supply of health labour, the health care system, policies, resources and \"global\" factors.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Framework for imbalance of human resources for health</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-1\"/></fig><p>Central to this framework are the demand for and supply of health labour. Also included in the framework is the health care system, and in particular, some of its features that are likely to have an impact on health workforce imbalances. Policies constitute another crucial element of the framework. In effect, health policies but also non-health-oriented policies can have an impact on health workforce imbalances. The framework also incorporates financial, physical and knowledge resources that contribute to model the health workforce.Finally, \"global\" factors such as economic, sociodemographic, political, geographical and cultural factors are included. These elements contribute directly or indirectly to shaping and transforming the entire society and hence the health workforce.</p></sec><sec><title>The demand for health personnel</title><p>The first element of the framework to be examined is the demand for health personnel. The demand for health personnel can be considered as a derived demand for health services. Accordingly, we should consider factors determining the demand for health services. Personal characteristics &#x02013; such as health needs, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics &#x02013; and economic factors play an important role.</p><p>It has often been proposed that the planning of human resources for health be based solely on estimates of health needs in the population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. However, relying only on the concept of need is difficult, because it can be defined either broadly or restrictedly and accordingly lead to a perception of either systematic shortage or surplus. Health needs is only one of the factors affecting the demand for health personnel.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of economic factors on the demand for health care. In particular in the United States, studies have attempted to estimate price and income elasticities of demand for medical services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. Measurements of price or income elasticities make it possible to evaluate the impact of a change in price or income on the demand for health care. Most studies reported elasticities in the range between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating that consumers tend to be responsive to price changes but that the degree of price sensitivity is not very large compared to that for many other goods and services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>Another element influencing the demand for health care is the value of a patient's time, such as travel time and waiting time. Acton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] found that in the United States, elasticity of demand with respect to travel time ranged between -0.6 and -1, meaning that a 10% increase in travel time would induce a reduction of 6%-10% in the demand for health care.</p><p>Other factors affect the demand for health labour. In particular, some specific features of the health care system and its features, policies, resources and environmental factors do have an impact on the demand for health labour. Their respective role will further discussed later.</p></sec><sec><title>The supply of human resources for health</title><p>After reviewing factors affecting the demand for health labour, we shall now turn to those affecting the supply of the health workforce. In particular, we shall consider the following elements: factors affecting the choice for a health professional training/education, participation in the health labour market and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Education/professional training choice</title><p>The availability of a renewed health workforce, as well as the type of profession and specialty chosen by individuals, is a major concern for health decision-makers. These issues are of particular relevance, especially since the number of younger people, predominantly women, choosing a nursing career is declining in some countries and since in professional training/education, individuals' choices do not always match the absorptive capacity of the market.</p><p>From an economic perspective, the decision to undertake professional training/education is considered an investment decision. To emphasize the essential similarities of these investments to other kinds of investments, economists refer to them as investment in human capital [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. Since investment decisions usually deliver payoffs over time, we must consider the entire stream of costs and benefits. The expected returns on human capital investments are a higher level of earnings, greater job satisfaction over one's lifetime and a greater appreciation of non-market activities and interests.</p><p>Based on the human capital approach, rate of return on education can be estimated. An average rate of return that is high and rising for a given profession will attract more individuals to that profession. On the other hand, a lower and decreasing average rate of return will discourage individuals from choosing that profession. Nowak and Preston [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], using the human capital approach, found that Australian nurses are poorly paid in comparison to other female professionals. The declining interest in nursing can be partly explained by the expansion of career opportunities in traditionally male-dominated occupations over the last three decades that entail a higher rate of return [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The number of young women entering the registered-nurse workforce has declined because many women who would have entered nursing in the past &#x02013; particularly those with high academic ability &#x02013; are now entering managerial and professional occupations that used to be traditionally male.</p><p>Besides the human capital approach, the choice of a profession can also be explained by sociopsychological factors. For instance, individuals may choose a profession because it is highly valued by the society or for family tradition. In the health sector, the satisfaction afforded by caring for people and assisting them to improve their health is an important element used by nursing schools to attract new enrollees. In the light of this approach, the decline in the number of individuals choosing nursing as a career might also be explained by the fact that this profession is now less socially valued than before [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participation in the labour market</title><p>The economic theory of the decision to work views the decision as a choice concerning how people spend their time. Individuals face a trade-off between labour and leisure. They decide how much of their time to spend working for pay or participating in leisure activities, the latter being activities that are not work-related.</p><p>An issue that has drawn a lot of attention recently is the impact of wage increases on labour participation, in particular for nurses. In the short term, higher wages can have at least two effects on the labour supply of current qualified nurses: first, qualified nurses who are working in other occupations may return to nursing activities; second, nurses now in practice may respond by working more hours. In the long run, higher wages in nursing relative to other occupations make nursing an attractive profession and will draw more people into nurse training programmes.</p><p>In their literature review of wage elasticity of nursing labour supply, Antonazzo et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] and Chiha and Link [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] found that most of the studies indicate a positive relationship, although not a strong one, between wages and labour supply. Accordingly, increases in nursing wages are unlikely to cause significant increases in labour participation. A literature review on the women's workforce undertaken by Killingsworth and Heckman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] indicated that in addition to wage rate, women's participation is responsive to changes in unearned income, spouse's wage and having children (particularly of pre-school age). Another aspect of labour supply decisions that has been investigated by Philips [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] is the costs associated with entering the nursing labour market (such as costs of child care and housework). The elasticity of participation with respect to changes in working costs was evaluated at -0.67 for all nurses. This suggests that a subsidy leading to a decrease of 10% in these costs would increase the participation of nurses by 6.7%.</p><p>Moreover, hospitals are also using a variety of strategies to recruit new staff. A survey of hospitals in the United States shows that richer benefits, such as health insurance and vacation time, are the most common incentives used. In addition, hospitals may offer other recruitment and retention benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, flexible hours and signing bonuses based on experience or length of commitment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. Many countries, but particularly developed ones, use such incentives to recruit new staff.</p><p>Economic factors also play a role in physician's participation in the labour market, as demonstrated by the impact of cost-containment policies in Canada, where most provincial governments have implemented an assortment of controls of health care expenses. Threshold reductions were introduced, so that fees payable to individual physicians were reduced as billing exceeded an agreed threshold. As a consequence, physicians who had billed at the threshold level chose to take leaves of absence rather than receive a level of reimbursement they considered inadequate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>].</p><p>When health personnel choose an alternative or additional occupation, this is likely to have consequences on health labour supply. In developing countries, and particularly in Africa, attempts to reform the health care sector have frequently failed to respond to the aspirations of staff concerning remuneration and working conditions. Salaries are often inadequate and may be paid late, and health workers try to solve their financial problems in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Private practice is only one of the many survival strategies that health personnel use to supplement their income and increase their job satisfaction. Teaching, attending training courses, supervision activities, research, trade and agriculture are some of these alternative strategies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Labour market exit</title><p>Parker and Rickam [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] examined the economic determinants of the labour force withdrawal of registered nurses in the United States, i.e. nurses leaving the profession to pursue a non-nursing occupation and employed nurses withdrawing from the labour force. Their results suggest that a significant number of registered nurses withdraw, at least temporarily, from the labour force. Among the significant elements influencing the withdrawal decision are the wage rate, other family income, presence of children and full-time/part-time work status. Increasing registered nurses' wages and working full-time is expected to reduce the probability of labour force withdrawal, whereas higher education levels, age and other family income increase the probability of labour force withdrawal.</p><p>The relative importance of wage is also emphasized by studies investigating job satisfaction. There is support in the empirical literature for the existence of job dissatisfaction among nurses, and the link between job dissatisfaction and job exit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]. In the United States the most important factors in nurses' resignation were, in order of importance: workload, staffing, time with patients, flexible scheduling, respect from nursing administration, increasing nursing knowledge, promotion opportunities, work stimulation, salary and decision-making. These studies suggest that salary is just one of the reasons why nurses are quitting. The relative importance of wage is confirmed by Shields and Ward [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]. Their results suggest that dissatisfaction with promotion and training opportunities has a stronger impact than workload or pay.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration</title><p>Migration of health personnel can have a serious impact on the supply of human resources in health, because it may exacerbate health personnel imbalances in \"sending\" countries. It is suggested that migration is an \"individual, spontaneous and voluntary act\" that is motivated by the perceived net gain of migrating &#x02013; that is, the gain will offset the tangible and intangible costs of moving [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Decisions to migrate are often a family strategy to produce a better income and improve survival chances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>The reality for many health workers in developing countries is to be underpaid, poorly motivated and increasingly dissatisfied and sceptical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. The relevance of motivation to migration is self-evident. There can be little doubt that for many health workers an improvement in pay and conditions will act as an incentive to stay in the country. Improved pensions, child care, educational opportunities and recognition are also known to be important [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. In Ghana it is estimated that only 191 of the 489 doctors who graduated between 1985 and 1994 were still working in the country in 1997 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Health system characteristics</title><p>As the health workforce is part of the health care system, we shall also consider features of the health care system that are likely to have an impact on the demand and supply of health labour. In particular, we shall examine market failures, the diversity of stakeholders, the supply-demand adjustment time lag and hospitals' potential monopsony power.</p></sec><sec><title>Market failures</title><p>From an economic perspective, the health care market is characterized by market failures &#x02013; that is, the assumptions for perfect competition are violated. From a societal perspective, in the presence of market failures such as externalities &#x02013; imperfect knowledge, asymmetry of information and uncertainty &#x02013; market mechanisms lead to a non-optimal demand and/or supply in health services. In other words, shortages and surpluses are likely to result from the health care market.</p><p>Most markets are characterized by market failures, but what is unique to the health services market is the extent of these market failures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Governments try to correct health care market failures through policy interventions. A classic example of public intervention in the presence of a positive externality is the introduction of a policy of mandatory vaccination. However, implementing such policies is sometimes difficult and may result in only partial correction of the market failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Stakeholders</title><p>The health care system is characterized by a wide range of institutional stakeholders involved in shaping human resources for health, all of whom may have different objectives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. The objectives of a union or professional association do not necessarily coincide, for example, with those of a government ministry, a hospital manager or the central government. Unions/professional associations seek to increase their members' market power, employment and income [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], whereas the ministry of finance will want more budget equilibrium and will favour measures to limit health care expenditures.</p><p>In the case of Mozambique, whereas the policy of employing national professionals by cooperation agencies has met with warm support from national cadres, its effect on the health sector is problematic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. The prospect of immediate financial gains puts pressure on qualified professionals to leave their posts within the Mozambique National Health Service to take up management or consultant positions. The substantial investment in their training is therefore producing dubious direct returns to the National Health Service. More seriously perhaps, the presence of donor-paid jobs outside the health sector (as programme coordinators, researchers, etc.) is creating pressure on the Ministry of Health itself, exacerbating the imbalances in the National Health Service and creating incentives for trained Mozambicans to leave the public sector.</p></sec><sec><title>Time lag</title><p>Moreover, adjustments between the demand and supply for health personnel may take a long time. In the health care field; the time lag between education and practising may be quite substantial. To obtain licensure to practise medicine requires lengthy education and training, and the long lag time between a changed student intake and a change in supply has been noted [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]: supply adjustment for physicians is not immediate, but takes a long time.</p></sec><sec><title>Hospitals' potential monopsony power</title><p>A single entity that is the sole purchaser of labour is a <italic>monopsony</italic>. One example is the potential monopsony power of hospitals in hiring nurses or the ministry of health in hiring the health workforce. The amount of labour demanded will influence the price the monopsonist must pay for it. In contrast to the situation in a competitive market, the monopsony is a price maker, not a price taker. Monopsony results in lower wages and lower employment of nurses compared to a competitive market.</p><p>A number of studies have tested whether or not hospitals possess monopsony power with respect to nurses, and the results are contradictory. Sullivan [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>] and Staiger et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>] concluded that hospitals have a substantial degree of monopsony power. In contrast, Hirsch and Schumacher [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>] did not find empirical support for the monopsony model. Nurses' wages were found not to be related to hospital density and to decrease rather than increase with respect to labour market size.</p></sec><sec><title>Provider power/monopoly</title><p>In contrast, providers' power may enable the latter to restrict the supply of human resources for health. Seldon, Jung and Cavazos [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such avenues as restricting supply and price-fixing. In France, trade unions are granted an institutional role at establishment level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. In India and Sri Lanka, a clear constraint to support-services contracting was the inability to counter the power of the public service unions in dictating employment terms and conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. The varying degree of homogeneity of the different professional groups may also explain their relative success in maintaining a monopoly of practice. In Iceland, one of the factors that contributed to breaking the professional monopoly of pharmacists was division within the profession [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Regulations</title><p>The type off regulation associated with a profession plays an important role regarding the supply of members of a profession. Regulation has, by tradition, been achieved through a combination of direct government regulation and, to a large extent, through rules adopted by professional associations, whose self-regulatory powers enable them to establish both entry requirements and rules regarding professional conduct [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>].</p><p>Such barriers to entry exist in particular for doctors, but also in other health professions, such as dentistry. Some argue that these barriers constitute a means to limit entry into the profession, and hence maintain high incomes. Muzondo and Pazderka [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] established, for Canadian professional licensing restrictions, a relationship between different variables of self-regulation and higher income. Seldon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such sources as restricting supply and price-fixing. However, the proponents of self-regulation claim that these barriers are a means to provide health care of quality and to protect patients from incompetent providers. In contrast, although most countries have a professional nursing association, nurses tend to have limited power to regulate entry to the profession. This could be associated with a large diversity of specialist groups in nursing failing to unite on issues related to professional regulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Health and non-health policies</title><p>Health and non-health policies contribute to shaping the health care system and have an influence on the demand and supply of health labour.</p><p>Health policy can be defined as a formal statement or procedure within institutions (notably government) that defines priorities and the parameters for action in response to health needs, available resources and other political pressures. Health policy is often enacted through legislation or other forms of rule-making that create regulations and incentives for providing health services and programmes and access to them. For instance, the decision to introduce or expand health insurance coverage is likely to have an impact on the demand for health services. This is illustrated by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, a controlled experiment that increased knowledge about the effect of different insurance copayments on use of medical services. Insurance copayments ranged from zero to 95%. The RAND study concluded that as the co-insurance rose, overall use and expenditure fell for adults and children combined [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>].</p><p>Non-health policies reflect state interventions in areas such as employment, education and regional development that contribute to shaping the health workforce. These policies do not directly address health issues, but have an indirect impact on such issues. In France, a controversial new regulation was introduced that reduced the workweek to a maximum of 35 hours in an attempt both to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and to achieve greater flexibility in the labour force. Unions responded by demanding the creation of more posts in public hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial, physical and knowledge resources</title><p>Financial, physical and knowledge resources are crucial to any type of health care workforce. The level of resources attributed to the health care system, and how these resources are used, will have a significant impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>In terms of financial resources, human resources account for a high proportion of national budgets assigned to the health sector [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Health expenditure claims an increasingly important share of the gross domestic product and, in most countries, wage costs (salaries, bonuses and other payments) are estimated to account for between 65% and 80% of the renewable health system expenditure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>].</p><p>Physical resources include human resources within the health sector and other sectors; buildings and engineering services such as sanitation, water and heating systems for community use and for the use of medical care institutions; and equipment and supplies. Finally, the health workforce is also constrained by its human capital. This human capital can be associated with the qualification and education of the health workforce. Education of the health workforce is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given in preparation for work.</p></sec><sec><title>Global factors</title><p>Economic, sociodemographic, cultural, and geographical factors contribute to shaping and transforming society and hence have a direct or indirect impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>From an economic perspective, for instance, there is evidence of a correlation between the level of economic development of a country and its level of human resources for health. Countries with higher GDP per capita are said to spend more on health care than countries with lower income, as demonstrated by cross-sectional studies, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>] and hence would also tend to have larger health workforces.</p><p>Moreover, both the demand and supply are likely to be affected by sociodemographic elements such as the age distribution of the population. On the demand side, the ageing of the population is giving rise to an increase in the demand for health services and health personnel, especially nurses for home care.</p><p>On the supply side, the ageing of the health workforce, and in particular of nurses, has serious implications for the future of the nursing labour market. For example, the Institute of Medicine noted that older registered nurses have a reduced capacity to perform certain tasks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. It was found that between 1983 and 1998 the average age of practising registered nurses increased by more than four years, from 37.4 to 41.9 years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. In contrast, the average age of the United States workforce as a whole increased by less than two years during the same period. Furthermore, the proportion of the registered-nurse workforce younger than 30 years decreased from 30.3% to 12.1% during this period.</p><p>Geographical and cultural factors also play a role in determining the demand and supply of human resources. Geographical characteristics affect the organization of health services delivery. For instance, a country with many islands or with isolated population groups will face particular challenges in terms of health workforce issues. Similarly, significant climatic changes are likely to give rise to changes in health needs, which in turn will call for changes in health services and in the health workforce. Finally, both cultural and political values also affect the demand for and supply of human resources for health.</p></sec><sec><title>Health workforce imbalances: a typology</title><p>This section considers a typology of imbalances, and differentiates between the following:</p><p>&#x02022; Profession/specialty imbalances: Under this category, we consider imbalance in the various health professions, such as doctors or nurses, as well as shortages within a profession, e.g. shortage of one type of specialists.</p><p>&#x02022; Geographical imbalances: These are disparities between urban and rural regions and poor and rich regions.</p><p>&#x02022; Institutional and services imbalances: These are differences in health workforce supply between health care facilities, as well as between services.</p><p>&#x02022; Gender imbalances: These are disparities in female/male representation in the health workforce.</p><sec><title>Profession/specialty imbalances</title><p>Imbalances have been reported for almost all health professions, and in particular for nurses. The United States General Accounting Office [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>] reports a nursing shortage. However, the nursing shortage has not been institution-wide but is concentrated in specialty care areas, particularly intensive care units and operating rooms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The shortage of registered nurses in intensive care units is explained in part by the sharp decline in the number of younger registered nurses, whom intensive care units have historically attracted. Shortages in operating rooms probably reflect that many registered nurses who work in this setting are reaching the age when they are beginning to reduce their hours worked or are retiring altogether.</p><p>Major variations occur in the number of health care workers per capita population and in the skill mix employed across countries, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor ratio varies widely from one country to another, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor skill mix is important and may have consequences for the respective tasks of nurses and doctors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that these variations are taking place among countries with a relatively similar economic development level.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of physicians, nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists in selected countries. WHO data, 2000.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-2\"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Geographical imbalances</title><p>Virtually all countries suffer from a geographical maldistribution of human resources for health, and the primary area of concern is usually the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In both industrialized and developing countries, urban areas almost invariably have a substantially higher concentration of physicians than rural areas.</p><p>Understandably, most health care professionals prefer to settle in urban areas, which offer opportunities for professional development as well as education and other amenities for themselves and their families. But it is in the rural and remote areas, especially in the developing countries, that most severe public health problems are found.</p><p>The geographical maldistribution of doctors has been the object of particular attention. In general there is a higher concentration of general practitioners in the inner suburbs of the metropolitan areas. According to the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>], the reasons for high concentration of general practitioners in inner city areas are:</p><p>&#x02022; historical</p><p>&#x02022; lifestyle-related: access to amenities</p><p>&#x02022; spouse/husband-related: greater employment opportunities</p><p>&#x02022; child-related: better access to secondary and tertiary education services</p><p>&#x02022; professional, family and social ties and professional ambitions.</p><p>The geographical distribution of health care personnel is an important issue in many countries. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, contains one-fifth of the country's population but around half of the available health personnel [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>]. In Bangladesh, most of the doctors (35%) and nurses (30%) in health services are located in four metropolitan districts where only 14.5% of the population lives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B70\">70</xref>]. This concentration pattern is characteristic of developing countries.</p><p>In Indonesia the geographical distribution of physicians is a particular concern, since Indonesia's vast size and difficult geography present a tremendous challenge to health service delivery [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B71\">71</xref>]. It is difficult to place doctors in remote islands or mountain or forest locations with few amenities, no opportunities for private practice, and poor communications with the rest of the country.</p><p>To improve the geographical distribution of physicians, governments often have used combinations of compulsory service and incentives. So far, there is virtually no country in the world that has solved the problem of a rural/urban imbalance of the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. This does not necessarily mean that policies and programmes designed to reduce the imbalance have had no effect. For example, Thailand has successfully begun to stem the migration of health professionals from rural to urban areas and from public to private facilities with a range of strong financial incentives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B72\">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Institutional and services imbalances</title><p>Institutional imbalances occur when some health care facilities have too many staff because of prestige, working conditions, ability to generate additional income, or other situation-specific factors, while others are understaffed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B73\">73</xref>]. Institutions such as magnet hospitals, for example, are hospitals characterized by adequate to excellent staffing, low turnover, rich nursing skill mix and greater job satisfaction, among other factors, even in the face of a general health personnel shortage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B74\">74</xref>].</p><p>Imbalance between the types of health services provided may also arise. In particular, we can consider the issue of curative versus preventive care. In effect, it has been estimated that most diseases (80%) and accidents are preventable through known methodologies, yet at present there is an imbalance in the funding of medical research, with only 1%-2% going to prevention and 98%-99% spent on curative approaches [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B75\">75</xref>]. This imbalance in funding raises the question of a health workforce imbalance between preventive and curative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Gender imbalances</title><p>In many countries, women still tend to concentrate in the lower-status health occupations and to be a minority among more highly trained professionals and managers. In Bangladesh, the distribution by gender of the health workforce shows that the total proportion of women accounts for little more than one-fifth in health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>]. The distribution of women by occupational category is biased in favour of nurses. Women are very poorly represented in other categories, such as dentists, medical assistants, pharmacists, managers/trainers and doctors. The underrepresentation of women in managerial and decision-making positions may lead to less attention to and poorer understanding of the problems specific to women and the particularities of their utilization patterns [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B77\">77</xref>].</p><p>Female general practitioners have been shown to practise differently from males, managing different types of medical conditions, with some differences due to patient mix and patient selectivity, and others inherent in the sex of physician. In some more traditional areas, some women will not seek care for themselves or even for their children because they do not have access to a female provider [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This framework can be used to assess policy reforms and their impact on health workforce imbalances; it also provides a common framework for cross-country comparisons. This framework emphasizes the number and type of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, illustrating the complexity of this issue. From a policy perspective, it is particularly interesting to identify factors that policy-makers can influence in order to remedy imbalance problems.</p><p>Various monetary and non-monetary incentives are used to influence the supply and/or demand for the health workforce. For example, subsidies, grants and scholarships are examples of incentives that can be used to attract more nursing students, whereas wage increases, additional benefits and working hours flexibility are examples of commonly used incentives to attract or retain the health workforce.</p><p>The numerous factors and actors involved in the health workforce imbalance issue call for a coherent health workforce vision and policy. In that context, health planning plays an important role since it contributes to shaping the health care system. Moreover, since from a societal perspective market mechanisms alone do not allow an adequate demand/supply of health personnel to be reached, public interventions such as human resources planning are a means to correct for market failures. Health planning involves a time horizon. Forecasting the future number of health personnel needed and developing policies to meet such figures are common to any health care system. Physicians represent the profession for which more planning effort has been expended to achieve a workforce of appropriate size than for any other health profession. Countries' desire to meet population health needs and to avoid social welfare losses resulting from a shortage or an oversupply are factors explaining, to a large extent, the importance attributed to planning in the context of public health policies.</p><p>The policy implications of forecasting either a shortage or a surplus of health care personnel are different, and hence attempts at projections must be rigorous. For instance, referring to previous studies predicting significant surpluses, Cooper [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B78\">78</xref>] notes that such large surpluses have not occurred so far, because of a decrease in physician work effort. Factors such as age, sex and lifestyle contributed to this evolution.</p><p>As a result of forecasted physician surpluses, various policy recommendations have been formulated. The United States Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B79\">79</xref>] published a report recommending, among other things, that there be no new medical schools, that existing schools should not increase their class size and that the number of first-year residency positions should be reduced. The Pew Health Professions Commission Report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B80\">80</xref>] issued a report recommending more severe steps, such as the closing of some medical schools and tightening the visa process for international medical graduates.</p><p>This framework also apprehends the different types of imbalances. This is important since the choice of a policy will also depend on the type of imbalance. Significant disparities in human resources for health between health occupation, regions, gender or health services are recognized as classic problems of imbalance. However, the question of a public/private imbalance is more debatable. One the one hand, we can argue that for equity and access, a health care system should have a strong public component. On the other hand, we can imagine a private-sector oriented health care system with mechanisms to ensure access to the poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of imbalances in the health workforce, this paper has discussed a framework for human resources for health and proposed a typology of imbalances. Although the term \"imbalance\" is commonly used with respect to the health workforce, it is clear that imbalance in the health workforce encompasses a wide range of possible situations and is a complex issue. The use of a framework should facilitate the development of policy tools and their assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'

It is a complex issue that encompasses a wide range of possible situations. This paper aims to contribute not only to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature, but also to the development of an analytical framework. The framework emphasizes the number and types of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, and facilitates the development of policy tools and their assessment. Moreover, to facilitate comparisons between health workforce imbalances, a typology of imbalances is proposed that differentiates between profession/specialty imbalances, geographical imbalances, institutional and services imbalances and gender imbalances.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Imbalance in the health workforce is a major challenge for health policy-makers, since human resources &#x02013; the different kinds of clinical and non-clinical staff who make each individual and public health intervention happen &#x02013; are the most important of the health system's inputs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. Imbalance is not a new issue, as nursing shortages were reported in hospitals in the United States of America as early as 1915 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. It remains a major concern to this day, reported in both developed and developing countries and for most of the health care professions.</p><p>Although imbalance in the health workforce is an important issue for policy-makers, various elements contribute to obscuring policy development. First, many reports of shortages are not borne out by the evidence. Rosenfeld and Moses [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] show that an overwhelming majority of newspapers, journals and newsletter articles describing the nursing situation in the United States presume the existence of a shortage. They found that even in those areas where concrete evidence of a shortage was not available, the term \"nursing shortage\" still appeared. Second, the notion of shortage is a relative one: what is considered a nursing shortage in Europe would probably be viewed differently from an African perspective. Finally, imbalances are of different types and their impact on the health care system varies. In consequence, there is a general need to critically review the imbalance issue.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature and the development of an analytical framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition</title><p>There are various approaches to defining imbalances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. From an economic perspective, a skill imbalance (shortage/surplus) occurs when the quantity of a given skill supplied by the workforce and the quantity demanded by employers diverge at the existing market conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Labour market supplies and demands for occupational skills fluctuate continuously, so at times there will be imbalances in the labour market. In other words, a shortage/surplus is the result of a disequilibrium between the demand and supply for labour. In contrast, non-economic definitions are usually normative, i.e. there is a shortage of labour relative to defined norms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. In the case of health personnel, these definitions are based either on a value judgement &#x02013; for instance, how much care people should receive &#x02013; or on a professional determination &#x02013; such as deciding what is the appropriate number of physicians for the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature</title><p>One of the key questions regarding imbalances is how long these last: Is the imbalance temporary or permanent? In a competitive labour market, we should expect most imbalances to be resolved over time. Imbalances will tend to disappear faster the greater the reaction speed and also the greater the elasticity of supply (or demand) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. This type of imbalance (shortage or surplus) is defined as dynamic.</p><p>In contrast, a static imbalance occurs because supply does not increase or decrease; market equilibrium is therefore not achieved. For instance, wage adjustments may respond slowly to shifts in demand or supply as a result of institutional and regulatory arrangements, imperfect market competition (monopoly, monopsony) and wage-control policies. Another example is physicians' education: because of the length of time required to educate physicians, changes in available supply take a long time to react significantly. Lack of information on the state of the various labour markets can also be a factor in the speed of market adjustment. To make proper labour market decisions, households and firms must be informed of the existing market conditions across markets. They must therefore know what wages are paid and the nature and location of job openings and available workers.</p><p>Moreover, we should also differentiate between qualitative and quantitative imbalance. In a tight labour market, employers might not find the ideal candidate, but will still recruit someone. Under these conditions, the issue is the quality of job candidates rather than the quantity of people willing and able to do the job [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. From the employers' perspective, a shortage of workers exists; from the job-market perspective, the existence of a shortage could be questioned because the jobs are filled. One negative hidden impact of a qualitative shortage is the number of positions that are filled with ineffective individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A conceptual framework</title><p>To better understand the role of factors affecting health workforce imbalances and to facilitate the development of policy tools, a conceptual framework is presented in this section.</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Factors affecting health workforce imbalances are numerous and complex, but focusing on crucial elements should permit insight into the issue of health workforce imbalances. The framework is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> and contains six main components: the demand for health labour, the supply of health labour, the health care system, policies, resources and \"global\" factors.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Framework for imbalance of human resources for health</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-1\"/></fig><p>Central to this framework are the demand for and supply of health labour. Also included in the framework is the health care system, and in particular, some of its features that are likely to have an impact on health workforce imbalances. Policies constitute another crucial element of the framework. In effect, health policies but also non-health-oriented policies can have an impact on health workforce imbalances. The framework also incorporates financial, physical and knowledge resources that contribute to model the health workforce.Finally, \"global\" factors such as economic, sociodemographic, political, geographical and cultural factors are included. These elements contribute directly or indirectly to shaping and transforming the entire society and hence the health workforce.</p></sec><sec><title>The demand for health personnel</title><p>The first element of the framework to be examined is the demand for health personnel. The demand for health personnel can be considered as a derived demand for health services. Accordingly, we should consider factors determining the demand for health services. Personal characteristics &#x02013; such as health needs, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics &#x02013; and economic factors play an important role.</p><p>It has often been proposed that the planning of human resources for health be based solely on estimates of health needs in the population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. However, relying only on the concept of need is difficult, because it can be defined either broadly or restrictedly and accordingly lead to a perception of either systematic shortage or surplus. Health needs is only one of the factors affecting the demand for health personnel.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of economic factors on the demand for health care. In particular in the United States, studies have attempted to estimate price and income elasticities of demand for medical services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. Measurements of price or income elasticities make it possible to evaluate the impact of a change in price or income on the demand for health care. Most studies reported elasticities in the range between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating that consumers tend to be responsive to price changes but that the degree of price sensitivity is not very large compared to that for many other goods and services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>Another element influencing the demand for health care is the value of a patient's time, such as travel time and waiting time. Acton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] found that in the United States, elasticity of demand with respect to travel time ranged between -0.6 and -1, meaning that a 10% increase in travel time would induce a reduction of 6%-10% in the demand for health care.</p><p>Other factors affect the demand for health labour. In particular, some specific features of the health care system and its features, policies, resources and environmental factors do have an impact on the demand for health labour. Their respective role will further discussed later.</p></sec><sec><title>The supply of human resources for health</title><p>After reviewing factors affecting the demand for health labour, we shall now turn to those affecting the supply of the health workforce. In particular, we shall consider the following elements: factors affecting the choice for a health professional training/education, participation in the health labour market and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Education/professional training choice</title><p>The availability of a renewed health workforce, as well as the type of profession and specialty chosen by individuals, is a major concern for health decision-makers. These issues are of particular relevance, especially since the number of younger people, predominantly women, choosing a nursing career is declining in some countries and since in professional training/education, individuals' choices do not always match the absorptive capacity of the market.</p><p>From an economic perspective, the decision to undertake professional training/education is considered an investment decision. To emphasize the essential similarities of these investments to other kinds of investments, economists refer to them as investment in human capital [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. Since investment decisions usually deliver payoffs over time, we must consider the entire stream of costs and benefits. The expected returns on human capital investments are a higher level of earnings, greater job satisfaction over one's lifetime and a greater appreciation of non-market activities and interests.</p><p>Based on the human capital approach, rate of return on education can be estimated. An average rate of return that is high and rising for a given profession will attract more individuals to that profession. On the other hand, a lower and decreasing average rate of return will discourage individuals from choosing that profession. Nowak and Preston [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], using the human capital approach, found that Australian nurses are poorly paid in comparison to other female professionals. The declining interest in nursing can be partly explained by the expansion of career opportunities in traditionally male-dominated occupations over the last three decades that entail a higher rate of return [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The number of young women entering the registered-nurse workforce has declined because many women who would have entered nursing in the past &#x02013; particularly those with high academic ability &#x02013; are now entering managerial and professional occupations that used to be traditionally male.</p><p>Besides the human capital approach, the choice of a profession can also be explained by sociopsychological factors. For instance, individuals may choose a profession because it is highly valued by the society or for family tradition. In the health sector, the satisfaction afforded by caring for people and assisting them to improve their health is an important element used by nursing schools to attract new enrollees. In the light of this approach, the decline in the number of individuals choosing nursing as a career might also be explained by the fact that this profession is now less socially valued than before [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participation in the labour market</title><p>The economic theory of the decision to work views the decision as a choice concerning how people spend their time. Individuals face a trade-off between labour and leisure. They decide how much of their time to spend working for pay or participating in leisure activities, the latter being activities that are not work-related.</p><p>An issue that has drawn a lot of attention recently is the impact of wage increases on labour participation, in particular for nurses. In the short term, higher wages can have at least two effects on the labour supply of current qualified nurses: first, qualified nurses who are working in other occupations may return to nursing activities; second, nurses now in practice may respond by working more hours. In the long run, higher wages in nursing relative to other occupations make nursing an attractive profession and will draw more people into nurse training programmes.</p><p>In their literature review of wage elasticity of nursing labour supply, Antonazzo et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] and Chiha and Link [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] found that most of the studies indicate a positive relationship, although not a strong one, between wages and labour supply. Accordingly, increases in nursing wages are unlikely to cause significant increases in labour participation. A literature review on the women's workforce undertaken by Killingsworth and Heckman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] indicated that in addition to wage rate, women's participation is responsive to changes in unearned income, spouse's wage and having children (particularly of pre-school age). Another aspect of labour supply decisions that has been investigated by Philips [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] is the costs associated with entering the nursing labour market (such as costs of child care and housework). The elasticity of participation with respect to changes in working costs was evaluated at -0.67 for all nurses. This suggests that a subsidy leading to a decrease of 10% in these costs would increase the participation of nurses by 6.7%.</p><p>Moreover, hospitals are also using a variety of strategies to recruit new staff. A survey of hospitals in the United States shows that richer benefits, such as health insurance and vacation time, are the most common incentives used. In addition, hospitals may offer other recruitment and retention benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, flexible hours and signing bonuses based on experience or length of commitment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. Many countries, but particularly developed ones, use such incentives to recruit new staff.</p><p>Economic factors also play a role in physician's participation in the labour market, as demonstrated by the impact of cost-containment policies in Canada, where most provincial governments have implemented an assortment of controls of health care expenses. Threshold reductions were introduced, so that fees payable to individual physicians were reduced as billing exceeded an agreed threshold. As a consequence, physicians who had billed at the threshold level chose to take leaves of absence rather than receive a level of reimbursement they considered inadequate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>].</p><p>When health personnel choose an alternative or additional occupation, this is likely to have consequences on health labour supply. In developing countries, and particularly in Africa, attempts to reform the health care sector have frequently failed to respond to the aspirations of staff concerning remuneration and working conditions. Salaries are often inadequate and may be paid late, and health workers try to solve their financial problems in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Private practice is only one of the many survival strategies that health personnel use to supplement their income and increase their job satisfaction. Teaching, attending training courses, supervision activities, research, trade and agriculture are some of these alternative strategies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Labour market exit</title><p>Parker and Rickam [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] examined the economic determinants of the labour force withdrawal of registered nurses in the United States, i.e. nurses leaving the profession to pursue a non-nursing occupation and employed nurses withdrawing from the labour force. Their results suggest that a significant number of registered nurses withdraw, at least temporarily, from the labour force. Among the significant elements influencing the withdrawal decision are the wage rate, other family income, presence of children and full-time/part-time work status. Increasing registered nurses' wages and working full-time is expected to reduce the probability of labour force withdrawal, whereas higher education levels, age and other family income increase the probability of labour force withdrawal.</p><p>The relative importance of wage is also emphasized by studies investigating job satisfaction. There is support in the empirical literature for the existence of job dissatisfaction among nurses, and the link between job dissatisfaction and job exit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]. In the United States the most important factors in nurses' resignation were, in order of importance: workload, staffing, time with patients, flexible scheduling, respect from nursing administration, increasing nursing knowledge, promotion opportunities, work stimulation, salary and decision-making. These studies suggest that salary is just one of the reasons why nurses are quitting. The relative importance of wage is confirmed by Shields and Ward [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]. Their results suggest that dissatisfaction with promotion and training opportunities has a stronger impact than workload or pay.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration</title><p>Migration of health personnel can have a serious impact on the supply of human resources in health, because it may exacerbate health personnel imbalances in \"sending\" countries. It is suggested that migration is an \"individual, spontaneous and voluntary act\" that is motivated by the perceived net gain of migrating &#x02013; that is, the gain will offset the tangible and intangible costs of moving [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Decisions to migrate are often a family strategy to produce a better income and improve survival chances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>The reality for many health workers in developing countries is to be underpaid, poorly motivated and increasingly dissatisfied and sceptical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. The relevance of motivation to migration is self-evident. There can be little doubt that for many health workers an improvement in pay and conditions will act as an incentive to stay in the country. Improved pensions, child care, educational opportunities and recognition are also known to be important [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. In Ghana it is estimated that only 191 of the 489 doctors who graduated between 1985 and 1994 were still working in the country in 1997 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Health system characteristics</title><p>As the health workforce is part of the health care system, we shall also consider features of the health care system that are likely to have an impact on the demand and supply of health labour. In particular, we shall examine market failures, the diversity of stakeholders, the supply-demand adjustment time lag and hospitals' potential monopsony power.</p></sec><sec><title>Market failures</title><p>From an economic perspective, the health care market is characterized by market failures &#x02013; that is, the assumptions for perfect competition are violated. From a societal perspective, in the presence of market failures such as externalities &#x02013; imperfect knowledge, asymmetry of information and uncertainty &#x02013; market mechanisms lead to a non-optimal demand and/or supply in health services. In other words, shortages and surpluses are likely to result from the health care market.</p><p>Most markets are characterized by market failures, but what is unique to the health services market is the extent of these market failures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Governments try to correct health care market failures through policy interventions. A classic example of public intervention in the presence of a positive externality is the introduction of a policy of mandatory vaccination. However, implementing such policies is sometimes difficult and may result in only partial correction of the market failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Stakeholders</title><p>The health care system is characterized by a wide range of institutional stakeholders involved in shaping human resources for health, all of whom may have different objectives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. The objectives of a union or professional association do not necessarily coincide, for example, with those of a government ministry, a hospital manager or the central government. Unions/professional associations seek to increase their members' market power, employment and income [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], whereas the ministry of finance will want more budget equilibrium and will favour measures to limit health care expenditures.</p><p>In the case of Mozambique, whereas the policy of employing national professionals by cooperation agencies has met with warm support from national cadres, its effect on the health sector is problematic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. The prospect of immediate financial gains puts pressure on qualified professionals to leave their posts within the Mozambique National Health Service to take up management or consultant positions. The substantial investment in their training is therefore producing dubious direct returns to the National Health Service. More seriously perhaps, the presence of donor-paid jobs outside the health sector (as programme coordinators, researchers, etc.) is creating pressure on the Ministry of Health itself, exacerbating the imbalances in the National Health Service and creating incentives for trained Mozambicans to leave the public sector.</p></sec><sec><title>Time lag</title><p>Moreover, adjustments between the demand and supply for health personnel may take a long time. In the health care field; the time lag between education and practising may be quite substantial. To obtain licensure to practise medicine requires lengthy education and training, and the long lag time between a changed student intake and a change in supply has been noted [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]: supply adjustment for physicians is not immediate, but takes a long time.</p></sec><sec><title>Hospitals' potential monopsony power</title><p>A single entity that is the sole purchaser of labour is a <italic>monopsony</italic>. One example is the potential monopsony power of hospitals in hiring nurses or the ministry of health in hiring the health workforce. The amount of labour demanded will influence the price the monopsonist must pay for it. In contrast to the situation in a competitive market, the monopsony is a price maker, not a price taker. Monopsony results in lower wages and lower employment of nurses compared to a competitive market.</p><p>A number of studies have tested whether or not hospitals possess monopsony power with respect to nurses, and the results are contradictory. Sullivan [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>] and Staiger et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>] concluded that hospitals have a substantial degree of monopsony power. In contrast, Hirsch and Schumacher [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>] did not find empirical support for the monopsony model. Nurses' wages were found not to be related to hospital density and to decrease rather than increase with respect to labour market size.</p></sec><sec><title>Provider power/monopoly</title><p>In contrast, providers' power may enable the latter to restrict the supply of human resources for health. Seldon, Jung and Cavazos [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such avenues as restricting supply and price-fixing. In France, trade unions are granted an institutional role at establishment level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. In India and Sri Lanka, a clear constraint to support-services contracting was the inability to counter the power of the public service unions in dictating employment terms and conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. The varying degree of homogeneity of the different professional groups may also explain their relative success in maintaining a monopoly of practice. In Iceland, one of the factors that contributed to breaking the professional monopoly of pharmacists was division within the profession [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Regulations</title><p>The type off regulation associated with a profession plays an important role regarding the supply of members of a profession. Regulation has, by tradition, been achieved through a combination of direct government regulation and, to a large extent, through rules adopted by professional associations, whose self-regulatory powers enable them to establish both entry requirements and rules regarding professional conduct [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>].</p><p>Such barriers to entry exist in particular for doctors, but also in other health professions, such as dentistry. Some argue that these barriers constitute a means to limit entry into the profession, and hence maintain high incomes. Muzondo and Pazderka [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] established, for Canadian professional licensing restrictions, a relationship between different variables of self-regulation and higher income. Seldon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such sources as restricting supply and price-fixing. However, the proponents of self-regulation claim that these barriers are a means to provide health care of quality and to protect patients from incompetent providers. In contrast, although most countries have a professional nursing association, nurses tend to have limited power to regulate entry to the profession. This could be associated with a large diversity of specialist groups in nursing failing to unite on issues related to professional regulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Health and non-health policies</title><p>Health and non-health policies contribute to shaping the health care system and have an influence on the demand and supply of health labour.</p><p>Health policy can be defined as a formal statement or procedure within institutions (notably government) that defines priorities and the parameters for action in response to health needs, available resources and other political pressures. Health policy is often enacted through legislation or other forms of rule-making that create regulations and incentives for providing health services and programmes and access to them. For instance, the decision to introduce or expand health insurance coverage is likely to have an impact on the demand for health services. This is illustrated by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, a controlled experiment that increased knowledge about the effect of different insurance copayments on use of medical services. Insurance copayments ranged from zero to 95%. The RAND study concluded that as the co-insurance rose, overall use and expenditure fell for adults and children combined [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>].</p><p>Non-health policies reflect state interventions in areas such as employment, education and regional development that contribute to shaping the health workforce. These policies do not directly address health issues, but have an indirect impact on such issues. In France, a controversial new regulation was introduced that reduced the workweek to a maximum of 35 hours in an attempt both to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and to achieve greater flexibility in the labour force. Unions responded by demanding the creation of more posts in public hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial, physical and knowledge resources</title><p>Financial, physical and knowledge resources are crucial to any type of health care workforce. The level of resources attributed to the health care system, and how these resources are used, will have a significant impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>In terms of financial resources, human resources account for a high proportion of national budgets assigned to the health sector [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Health expenditure claims an increasingly important share of the gross domestic product and, in most countries, wage costs (salaries, bonuses and other payments) are estimated to account for between 65% and 80% of the renewable health system expenditure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>].</p><p>Physical resources include human resources within the health sector and other sectors; buildings and engineering services such as sanitation, water and heating systems for community use and for the use of medical care institutions; and equipment and supplies. Finally, the health workforce is also constrained by its human capital. This human capital can be associated with the qualification and education of the health workforce. Education of the health workforce is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given in preparation for work.</p></sec><sec><title>Global factors</title><p>Economic, sociodemographic, cultural, and geographical factors contribute to shaping and transforming society and hence have a direct or indirect impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>From an economic perspective, for instance, there is evidence of a correlation between the level of economic development of a country and its level of human resources for health. Countries with higher GDP per capita are said to spend more on health care than countries with lower income, as demonstrated by cross-sectional studies, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>] and hence would also tend to have larger health workforces.</p><p>Moreover, both the demand and supply are likely to be affected by sociodemographic elements such as the age distribution of the population. On the demand side, the ageing of the population is giving rise to an increase in the demand for health services and health personnel, especially nurses for home care.</p><p>On the supply side, the ageing of the health workforce, and in particular of nurses, has serious implications for the future of the nursing labour market. For example, the Institute of Medicine noted that older registered nurses have a reduced capacity to perform certain tasks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. It was found that between 1983 and 1998 the average age of practising registered nurses increased by more than four years, from 37.4 to 41.9 years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. In contrast, the average age of the United States workforce as a whole increased by less than two years during the same period. Furthermore, the proportion of the registered-nurse workforce younger than 30 years decreased from 30.3% to 12.1% during this period.</p><p>Geographical and cultural factors also play a role in determining the demand and supply of human resources. Geographical characteristics affect the organization of health services delivery. For instance, a country with many islands or with isolated population groups will face particular challenges in terms of health workforce issues. Similarly, significant climatic changes are likely to give rise to changes in health needs, which in turn will call for changes in health services and in the health workforce. Finally, both cultural and political values also affect the demand for and supply of human resources for health.</p></sec><sec><title>Health workforce imbalances: a typology</title><p>This section considers a typology of imbalances, and differentiates between the following:</p><p>&#x02022; Profession/specialty imbalances: Under this category, we consider imbalance in the various health professions, such as doctors or nurses, as well as shortages within a profession, e.g. shortage of one type of specialists.</p><p>&#x02022; Geographical imbalances: These are disparities between urban and rural regions and poor and rich regions.</p><p>&#x02022; Institutional and services imbalances: These are differences in health workforce supply between health care facilities, as well as between services.</p><p>&#x02022; Gender imbalances: These are disparities in female/male representation in the health workforce.</p><sec><title>Profession/specialty imbalances</title><p>Imbalances have been reported for almost all health professions, and in particular for nurses. The United States General Accounting Office [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>] reports a nursing shortage. However, the nursing shortage has not been institution-wide but is concentrated in specialty care areas, particularly intensive care units and operating rooms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The shortage of registered nurses in intensive care units is explained in part by the sharp decline in the number of younger registered nurses, whom intensive care units have historically attracted. Shortages in operating rooms probably reflect that many registered nurses who work in this setting are reaching the age when they are beginning to reduce their hours worked or are retiring altogether.</p><p>Major variations occur in the number of health care workers per capita population and in the skill mix employed across countries, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor ratio varies widely from one country to another, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor skill mix is important and may have consequences for the respective tasks of nurses and doctors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that these variations are taking place among countries with a relatively similar economic development level.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of physicians, nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists in selected countries. WHO data, 2000.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-2\"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Geographical imbalances</title><p>Virtually all countries suffer from a geographical maldistribution of human resources for health, and the primary area of concern is usually the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In both industrialized and developing countries, urban areas almost invariably have a substantially higher concentration of physicians than rural areas.</p><p>Understandably, most health care professionals prefer to settle in urban areas, which offer opportunities for professional development as well as education and other amenities for themselves and their families. But it is in the rural and remote areas, especially in the developing countries, that most severe public health problems are found.</p><p>The geographical maldistribution of doctors has been the object of particular attention. In general there is a higher concentration of general practitioners in the inner suburbs of the metropolitan areas. According to the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>], the reasons for high concentration of general practitioners in inner city areas are:</p><p>&#x02022; historical</p><p>&#x02022; lifestyle-related: access to amenities</p><p>&#x02022; spouse/husband-related: greater employment opportunities</p><p>&#x02022; child-related: better access to secondary and tertiary education services</p><p>&#x02022; professional, family and social ties and professional ambitions.</p><p>The geographical distribution of health care personnel is an important issue in many countries. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, contains one-fifth of the country's population but around half of the available health personnel [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>]. In Bangladesh, most of the doctors (35%) and nurses (30%) in health services are located in four metropolitan districts where only 14.5% of the population lives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B70\">70</xref>]. This concentration pattern is characteristic of developing countries.</p><p>In Indonesia the geographical distribution of physicians is a particular concern, since Indonesia's vast size and difficult geography present a tremendous challenge to health service delivery [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B71\">71</xref>]. It is difficult to place doctors in remote islands or mountain or forest locations with few amenities, no opportunities for private practice, and poor communications with the rest of the country.</p><p>To improve the geographical distribution of physicians, governments often have used combinations of compulsory service and incentives. So far, there is virtually no country in the world that has solved the problem of a rural/urban imbalance of the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. This does not necessarily mean that policies and programmes designed to reduce the imbalance have had no effect. For example, Thailand has successfully begun to stem the migration of health professionals from rural to urban areas and from public to private facilities with a range of strong financial incentives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B72\">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Institutional and services imbalances</title><p>Institutional imbalances occur when some health care facilities have too many staff because of prestige, working conditions, ability to generate additional income, or other situation-specific factors, while others are understaffed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B73\">73</xref>]. Institutions such as magnet hospitals, for example, are hospitals characterized by adequate to excellent staffing, low turnover, rich nursing skill mix and greater job satisfaction, among other factors, even in the face of a general health personnel shortage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B74\">74</xref>].</p><p>Imbalance between the types of health services provided may also arise. In particular, we can consider the issue of curative versus preventive care. In effect, it has been estimated that most diseases (80%) and accidents are preventable through known methodologies, yet at present there is an imbalance in the funding of medical research, with only 1%-2% going to prevention and 98%-99% spent on curative approaches [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B75\">75</xref>]. This imbalance in funding raises the question of a health workforce imbalance between preventive and curative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Gender imbalances</title><p>In many countries, women still tend to concentrate in the lower-status health occupations and to be a minority among more highly trained professionals and managers. In Bangladesh, the distribution by gender of the health workforce shows that the total proportion of women accounts for little more than one-fifth in health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>]. The distribution of women by occupational category is biased in favour of nurses. Women are very poorly represented in other categories, such as dentists, medical assistants, pharmacists, managers/trainers and doctors. The underrepresentation of women in managerial and decision-making positions may lead to less attention to and poorer understanding of the problems specific to women and the particularities of their utilization patterns [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B77\">77</xref>].</p><p>Female general practitioners have been shown to practise differently from males, managing different types of medical conditions, with some differences due to patient mix and patient selectivity, and others inherent in the sex of physician. In some more traditional areas, some women will not seek care for themselves or even for their children because they do not have access to a female provider [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This framework can be used to assess policy reforms and their impact on health workforce imbalances; it also provides a common framework for cross-country comparisons. This framework emphasizes the number and type of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, illustrating the complexity of this issue. From a policy perspective, it is particularly interesting to identify factors that policy-makers can influence in order to remedy imbalance problems.</p><p>Various monetary and non-monetary incentives are used to influence the supply and/or demand for the health workforce. For example, subsidies, grants and scholarships are examples of incentives that can be used to attract more nursing students, whereas wage increases, additional benefits and working hours flexibility are examples of commonly used incentives to attract or retain the health workforce.</p><p>The numerous factors and actors involved in the health workforce imbalance issue call for a coherent health workforce vision and policy. In that context, health planning plays an important role since it contributes to shaping the health care system. Moreover, since from a societal perspective market mechanisms alone do not allow an adequate demand/supply of health personnel to be reached, public interventions such as human resources planning are a means to correct for market failures. Health planning involves a time horizon. Forecasting the future number of health personnel needed and developing policies to meet such figures are common to any health care system. Physicians represent the profession for which more planning effort has been expended to achieve a workforce of appropriate size than for any other health profession. Countries' desire to meet population health needs and to avoid social welfare losses resulting from a shortage or an oversupply are factors explaining, to a large extent, the importance attributed to planning in the context of public health policies.</p><p>The policy implications of forecasting either a shortage or a surplus of health care personnel are different, and hence attempts at projections must be rigorous. For instance, referring to previous studies predicting significant surpluses, Cooper [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B78\">78</xref>] notes that such large surpluses have not occurred so far, because of a decrease in physician work effort. Factors such as age, sex and lifestyle contributed to this evolution.</p><p>As a result of forecasted physician surpluses, various policy recommendations have been formulated. The United States Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B79\">79</xref>] published a report recommending, among other things, that there be no new medical schools, that existing schools should not increase their class size and that the number of first-year residency positions should be reduced. The Pew Health Professions Commission Report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B80\">80</xref>] issued a report recommending more severe steps, such as the closing of some medical schools and tightening the visa process for international medical graduates.</p><p>This framework also apprehends the different types of imbalances. This is important since the choice of a policy will also depend on the type of imbalance. Significant disparities in human resources for health between health occupation, regions, gender or health services are recognized as classic problems of imbalance. However, the question of a public/private imbalance is more debatable. One the one hand, we can argue that for equity and access, a health care system should have a strong public component. On the other hand, we can imagine a private-sector oriented health care system with mechanisms to ensure access to the poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of imbalances in the health workforce, this paper has discussed a framework for human resources for health and proposed a typology of imbalances. Although the term \"imbalance\" is commonly used with respect to the health workforce, it is clear that imbalance in the health workforce encompasses a wide range of possible situations and is a complex issue. The use of a framework should facilitate the development of policy tools and their assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'

It is a complex issue that encompasses a wide range of possible situations. This paper aims to contribute not only to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature, but also to the development of an analytical framework. The framework emphasizes the number and types of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, and facilitates the development of policy tools and their assessment. Moreover, to facilitate comparisons between health workforce imbalances, a typology of imbalances is proposed that differentiates between profession/specialty imbalances, geographical imbalances, institutional and services imbalances and gender imbalances.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Imbalance in the health workforce is a major challenge for health policy-makers, since human resources &#x02013; the different kinds of clinical and non-clinical staff who make each individual and public health intervention happen &#x02013; are the most important of the health system's inputs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. Imbalance is not a new issue, as nursing shortages were reported in hospitals in the United States of America as early as 1915 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. It remains a major concern to this day, reported in both developed and developing countries and for most of the health care professions.</p><p>Although imbalance in the health workforce is an important issue for policy-makers, various elements contribute to obscuring policy development. First, many reports of shortages are not borne out by the evidence. Rosenfeld and Moses [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] show that an overwhelming majority of newspapers, journals and newsletter articles describing the nursing situation in the United States presume the existence of a shortage. They found that even in those areas where concrete evidence of a shortage was not available, the term \"nursing shortage\" still appeared. Second, the notion of shortage is a relative one: what is considered a nursing shortage in Europe would probably be viewed differently from an African perspective. Finally, imbalances are of different types and their impact on the health care system varies. In consequence, there is a general need to critically review the imbalance issue.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature and the development of an analytical framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition</title><p>There are various approaches to defining imbalances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. From an economic perspective, a skill imbalance (shortage/surplus) occurs when the quantity of a given skill supplied by the workforce and the quantity demanded by employers diverge at the existing market conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Labour market supplies and demands for occupational skills fluctuate continuously, so at times there will be imbalances in the labour market. In other words, a shortage/surplus is the result of a disequilibrium between the demand and supply for labour. In contrast, non-economic definitions are usually normative, i.e. there is a shortage of labour relative to defined norms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. In the case of health personnel, these definitions are based either on a value judgement &#x02013; for instance, how much care people should receive &#x02013; or on a professional determination &#x02013; such as deciding what is the appropriate number of physicians for the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature</title><p>One of the key questions regarding imbalances is how long these last: Is the imbalance temporary or permanent? In a competitive labour market, we should expect most imbalances to be resolved over time. Imbalances will tend to disappear faster the greater the reaction speed and also the greater the elasticity of supply (or demand) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. This type of imbalance (shortage or surplus) is defined as dynamic.</p><p>In contrast, a static imbalance occurs because supply does not increase or decrease; market equilibrium is therefore not achieved. For instance, wage adjustments may respond slowly to shifts in demand or supply as a result of institutional and regulatory arrangements, imperfect market competition (monopoly, monopsony) and wage-control policies. Another example is physicians' education: because of the length of time required to educate physicians, changes in available supply take a long time to react significantly. Lack of information on the state of the various labour markets can also be a factor in the speed of market adjustment. To make proper labour market decisions, households and firms must be informed of the existing market conditions across markets. They must therefore know what wages are paid and the nature and location of job openings and available workers.</p><p>Moreover, we should also differentiate between qualitative and quantitative imbalance. In a tight labour market, employers might not find the ideal candidate, but will still recruit someone. Under these conditions, the issue is the quality of job candidates rather than the quantity of people willing and able to do the job [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. From the employers' perspective, a shortage of workers exists; from the job-market perspective, the existence of a shortage could be questioned because the jobs are filled. One negative hidden impact of a qualitative shortage is the number of positions that are filled with ineffective individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A conceptual framework</title><p>To better understand the role of factors affecting health workforce imbalances and to facilitate the development of policy tools, a conceptual framework is presented in this section.</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Factors affecting health workforce imbalances are numerous and complex, but focusing on crucial elements should permit insight into the issue of health workforce imbalances. The framework is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> and contains six main components: the demand for health labour, the supply of health labour, the health care system, policies, resources and \"global\" factors.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Framework for imbalance of human resources for health</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-1\"/></fig><p>Central to this framework are the demand for and supply of health labour. Also included in the framework is the health care system, and in particular, some of its features that are likely to have an impact on health workforce imbalances. Policies constitute another crucial element of the framework. In effect, health policies but also non-health-oriented policies can have an impact on health workforce imbalances. The framework also incorporates financial, physical and knowledge resources that contribute to model the health workforce.Finally, \"global\" factors such as economic, sociodemographic, political, geographical and cultural factors are included. These elements contribute directly or indirectly to shaping and transforming the entire society and hence the health workforce.</p></sec><sec><title>The demand for health personnel</title><p>The first element of the framework to be examined is the demand for health personnel. The demand for health personnel can be considered as a derived demand for health services. Accordingly, we should consider factors determining the demand for health services. Personal characteristics &#x02013; such as health needs, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics &#x02013; and economic factors play an important role.</p><p>It has often been proposed that the planning of human resources for health be based solely on estimates of health needs in the population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. However, relying only on the concept of need is difficult, because it can be defined either broadly or restrictedly and accordingly lead to a perception of either systematic shortage or surplus. Health needs is only one of the factors affecting the demand for health personnel.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of economic factors on the demand for health care. In particular in the United States, studies have attempted to estimate price and income elasticities of demand for medical services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. Measurements of price or income elasticities make it possible to evaluate the impact of a change in price or income on the demand for health care. Most studies reported elasticities in the range between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating that consumers tend to be responsive to price changes but that the degree of price sensitivity is not very large compared to that for many other goods and services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>Another element influencing the demand for health care is the value of a patient's time, such as travel time and waiting time. Acton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] found that in the United States, elasticity of demand with respect to travel time ranged between -0.6 and -1, meaning that a 10% increase in travel time would induce a reduction of 6%-10% in the demand for health care.</p><p>Other factors affect the demand for health labour. In particular, some specific features of the health care system and its features, policies, resources and environmental factors do have an impact on the demand for health labour. Their respective role will further discussed later.</p></sec><sec><title>The supply of human resources for health</title><p>After reviewing factors affecting the demand for health labour, we shall now turn to those affecting the supply of the health workforce. In particular, we shall consider the following elements: factors affecting the choice for a health professional training/education, participation in the health labour market and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Education/professional training choice</title><p>The availability of a renewed health workforce, as well as the type of profession and specialty chosen by individuals, is a major concern for health decision-makers. These issues are of particular relevance, especially since the number of younger people, predominantly women, choosing a nursing career is declining in some countries and since in professional training/education, individuals' choices do not always match the absorptive capacity of the market.</p><p>From an economic perspective, the decision to undertake professional training/education is considered an investment decision. To emphasize the essential similarities of these investments to other kinds of investments, economists refer to them as investment in human capital [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. Since investment decisions usually deliver payoffs over time, we must consider the entire stream of costs and benefits. The expected returns on human capital investments are a higher level of earnings, greater job satisfaction over one's lifetime and a greater appreciation of non-market activities and interests.</p><p>Based on the human capital approach, rate of return on education can be estimated. An average rate of return that is high and rising for a given profession will attract more individuals to that profession. On the other hand, a lower and decreasing average rate of return will discourage individuals from choosing that profession. Nowak and Preston [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], using the human capital approach, found that Australian nurses are poorly paid in comparison to other female professionals. The declining interest in nursing can be partly explained by the expansion of career opportunities in traditionally male-dominated occupations over the last three decades that entail a higher rate of return [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The number of young women entering the registered-nurse workforce has declined because many women who would have entered nursing in the past &#x02013; particularly those with high academic ability &#x02013; are now entering managerial and professional occupations that used to be traditionally male.</p><p>Besides the human capital approach, the choice of a profession can also be explained by sociopsychological factors. For instance, individuals may choose a profession because it is highly valued by the society or for family tradition. In the health sector, the satisfaction afforded by caring for people and assisting them to improve their health is an important element used by nursing schools to attract new enrollees. In the light of this approach, the decline in the number of individuals choosing nursing as a career might also be explained by the fact that this profession is now less socially valued than before [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participation in the labour market</title><p>The economic theory of the decision to work views the decision as a choice concerning how people spend their time. Individuals face a trade-off between labour and leisure. They decide how much of their time to spend working for pay or participating in leisure activities, the latter being activities that are not work-related.</p><p>An issue that has drawn a lot of attention recently is the impact of wage increases on labour participation, in particular for nurses. In the short term, higher wages can have at least two effects on the labour supply of current qualified nurses: first, qualified nurses who are working in other occupations may return to nursing activities; second, nurses now in practice may respond by working more hours. In the long run, higher wages in nursing relative to other occupations make nursing an attractive profession and will draw more people into nurse training programmes.</p><p>In their literature review of wage elasticity of nursing labour supply, Antonazzo et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] and Chiha and Link [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] found that most of the studies indicate a positive relationship, although not a strong one, between wages and labour supply. Accordingly, increases in nursing wages are unlikely to cause significant increases in labour participation. A literature review on the women's workforce undertaken by Killingsworth and Heckman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] indicated that in addition to wage rate, women's participation is responsive to changes in unearned income, spouse's wage and having children (particularly of pre-school age). Another aspect of labour supply decisions that has been investigated by Philips [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] is the costs associated with entering the nursing labour market (such as costs of child care and housework). The elasticity of participation with respect to changes in working costs was evaluated at -0.67 for all nurses. This suggests that a subsidy leading to a decrease of 10% in these costs would increase the participation of nurses by 6.7%.</p><p>Moreover, hospitals are also using a variety of strategies to recruit new staff. A survey of hospitals in the United States shows that richer benefits, such as health insurance and vacation time, are the most common incentives used. In addition, hospitals may offer other recruitment and retention benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, flexible hours and signing bonuses based on experience or length of commitment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. Many countries, but particularly developed ones, use such incentives to recruit new staff.</p><p>Economic factors also play a role in physician's participation in the labour market, as demonstrated by the impact of cost-containment policies in Canada, where most provincial governments have implemented an assortment of controls of health care expenses. Threshold reductions were introduced, so that fees payable to individual physicians were reduced as billing exceeded an agreed threshold. As a consequence, physicians who had billed at the threshold level chose to take leaves of absence rather than receive a level of reimbursement they considered inadequate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>].</p><p>When health personnel choose an alternative or additional occupation, this is likely to have consequences on health labour supply. In developing countries, and particularly in Africa, attempts to reform the health care sector have frequently failed to respond to the aspirations of staff concerning remuneration and working conditions. Salaries are often inadequate and may be paid late, and health workers try to solve their financial problems in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Private practice is only one of the many survival strategies that health personnel use to supplement their income and increase their job satisfaction. Teaching, attending training courses, supervision activities, research, trade and agriculture are some of these alternative strategies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Labour market exit</title><p>Parker and Rickam [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] examined the economic determinants of the labour force withdrawal of registered nurses in the United States, i.e. nurses leaving the profession to pursue a non-nursing occupation and employed nurses withdrawing from the labour force. Their results suggest that a significant number of registered nurses withdraw, at least temporarily, from the labour force. Among the significant elements influencing the withdrawal decision are the wage rate, other family income, presence of children and full-time/part-time work status. Increasing registered nurses' wages and working full-time is expected to reduce the probability of labour force withdrawal, whereas higher education levels, age and other family income increase the probability of labour force withdrawal.</p><p>The relative importance of wage is also emphasized by studies investigating job satisfaction. There is support in the empirical literature for the existence of job dissatisfaction among nurses, and the link between job dissatisfaction and job exit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]. In the United States the most important factors in nurses' resignation were, in order of importance: workload, staffing, time with patients, flexible scheduling, respect from nursing administration, increasing nursing knowledge, promotion opportunities, work stimulation, salary and decision-making. These studies suggest that salary is just one of the reasons why nurses are quitting. The relative importance of wage is confirmed by Shields and Ward [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]. Their results suggest that dissatisfaction with promotion and training opportunities has a stronger impact than workload or pay.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration</title><p>Migration of health personnel can have a serious impact on the supply of human resources in health, because it may exacerbate health personnel imbalances in \"sending\" countries. It is suggested that migration is an \"individual, spontaneous and voluntary act\" that is motivated by the perceived net gain of migrating &#x02013; that is, the gain will offset the tangible and intangible costs of moving [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Decisions to migrate are often a family strategy to produce a better income and improve survival chances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>The reality for many health workers in developing countries is to be underpaid, poorly motivated and increasingly dissatisfied and sceptical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. The relevance of motivation to migration is self-evident. There can be little doubt that for many health workers an improvement in pay and conditions will act as an incentive to stay in the country. Improved pensions, child care, educational opportunities and recognition are also known to be important [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. In Ghana it is estimated that only 191 of the 489 doctors who graduated between 1985 and 1994 were still working in the country in 1997 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Health system characteristics</title><p>As the health workforce is part of the health care system, we shall also consider features of the health care system that are likely to have an impact on the demand and supply of health labour. In particular, we shall examine market failures, the diversity of stakeholders, the supply-demand adjustment time lag and hospitals' potential monopsony power.</p></sec><sec><title>Market failures</title><p>From an economic perspective, the health care market is characterized by market failures &#x02013; that is, the assumptions for perfect competition are violated. From a societal perspective, in the presence of market failures such as externalities &#x02013; imperfect knowledge, asymmetry of information and uncertainty &#x02013; market mechanisms lead to a non-optimal demand and/or supply in health services. In other words, shortages and surpluses are likely to result from the health care market.</p><p>Most markets are characterized by market failures, but what is unique to the health services market is the extent of these market failures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Governments try to correct health care market failures through policy interventions. A classic example of public intervention in the presence of a positive externality is the introduction of a policy of mandatory vaccination. However, implementing such policies is sometimes difficult and may result in only partial correction of the market failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Stakeholders</title><p>The health care system is characterized by a wide range of institutional stakeholders involved in shaping human resources for health, all of whom may have different objectives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. The objectives of a union or professional association do not necessarily coincide, for example, with those of a government ministry, a hospital manager or the central government. Unions/professional associations seek to increase their members' market power, employment and income [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], whereas the ministry of finance will want more budget equilibrium and will favour measures to limit health care expenditures.</p><p>In the case of Mozambique, whereas the policy of employing national professionals by cooperation agencies has met with warm support from national cadres, its effect on the health sector is problematic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. The prospect of immediate financial gains puts pressure on qualified professionals to leave their posts within the Mozambique National Health Service to take up management or consultant positions. The substantial investment in their training is therefore producing dubious direct returns to the National Health Service. More seriously perhaps, the presence of donor-paid jobs outside the health sector (as programme coordinators, researchers, etc.) is creating pressure on the Ministry of Health itself, exacerbating the imbalances in the National Health Service and creating incentives for trained Mozambicans to leave the public sector.</p></sec><sec><title>Time lag</title><p>Moreover, adjustments between the demand and supply for health personnel may take a long time. In the health care field; the time lag between education and practising may be quite substantial. To obtain licensure to practise medicine requires lengthy education and training, and the long lag time between a changed student intake and a change in supply has been noted [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]: supply adjustment for physicians is not immediate, but takes a long time.</p></sec><sec><title>Hospitals' potential monopsony power</title><p>A single entity that is the sole purchaser of labour is a <italic>monopsony</italic>. One example is the potential monopsony power of hospitals in hiring nurses or the ministry of health in hiring the health workforce. The amount of labour demanded will influence the price the monopsonist must pay for it. In contrast to the situation in a competitive market, the monopsony is a price maker, not a price taker. Monopsony results in lower wages and lower employment of nurses compared to a competitive market.</p><p>A number of studies have tested whether or not hospitals possess monopsony power with respect to nurses, and the results are contradictory. Sullivan [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>] and Staiger et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>] concluded that hospitals have a substantial degree of monopsony power. In contrast, Hirsch and Schumacher [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>] did not find empirical support for the monopsony model. Nurses' wages were found not to be related to hospital density and to decrease rather than increase with respect to labour market size.</p></sec><sec><title>Provider power/monopoly</title><p>In contrast, providers' power may enable the latter to restrict the supply of human resources for health. Seldon, Jung and Cavazos [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such avenues as restricting supply and price-fixing. In France, trade unions are granted an institutional role at establishment level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. In India and Sri Lanka, a clear constraint to support-services contracting was the inability to counter the power of the public service unions in dictating employment terms and conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. The varying degree of homogeneity of the different professional groups may also explain their relative success in maintaining a monopoly of practice. In Iceland, one of the factors that contributed to breaking the professional monopoly of pharmacists was division within the profession [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Regulations</title><p>The type off regulation associated with a profession plays an important role regarding the supply of members of a profession. Regulation has, by tradition, been achieved through a combination of direct government regulation and, to a large extent, through rules adopted by professional associations, whose self-regulatory powers enable them to establish both entry requirements and rules regarding professional conduct [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>].</p><p>Such barriers to entry exist in particular for doctors, but also in other health professions, such as dentistry. Some argue that these barriers constitute a means to limit entry into the profession, and hence maintain high incomes. Muzondo and Pazderka [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] established, for Canadian professional licensing restrictions, a relationship between different variables of self-regulation and higher income. Seldon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such sources as restricting supply and price-fixing. However, the proponents of self-regulation claim that these barriers are a means to provide health care of quality and to protect patients from incompetent providers. In contrast, although most countries have a professional nursing association, nurses tend to have limited power to regulate entry to the profession. This could be associated with a large diversity of specialist groups in nursing failing to unite on issues related to professional regulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Health and non-health policies</title><p>Health and non-health policies contribute to shaping the health care system and have an influence on the demand and supply of health labour.</p><p>Health policy can be defined as a formal statement or procedure within institutions (notably government) that defines priorities and the parameters for action in response to health needs, available resources and other political pressures. Health policy is often enacted through legislation or other forms of rule-making that create regulations and incentives for providing health services and programmes and access to them. For instance, the decision to introduce or expand health insurance coverage is likely to have an impact on the demand for health services. This is illustrated by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, a controlled experiment that increased knowledge about the effect of different insurance copayments on use of medical services. Insurance copayments ranged from zero to 95%. The RAND study concluded that as the co-insurance rose, overall use and expenditure fell for adults and children combined [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>].</p><p>Non-health policies reflect state interventions in areas such as employment, education and regional development that contribute to shaping the health workforce. These policies do not directly address health issues, but have an indirect impact on such issues. In France, a controversial new regulation was introduced that reduced the workweek to a maximum of 35 hours in an attempt both to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and to achieve greater flexibility in the labour force. Unions responded by demanding the creation of more posts in public hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial, physical and knowledge resources</title><p>Financial, physical and knowledge resources are crucial to any type of health care workforce. The level of resources attributed to the health care system, and how these resources are used, will have a significant impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>In terms of financial resources, human resources account for a high proportion of national budgets assigned to the health sector [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Health expenditure claims an increasingly important share of the gross domestic product and, in most countries, wage costs (salaries, bonuses and other payments) are estimated to account for between 65% and 80% of the renewable health system expenditure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>].</p><p>Physical resources include human resources within the health sector and other sectors; buildings and engineering services such as sanitation, water and heating systems for community use and for the use of medical care institutions; and equipment and supplies. Finally, the health workforce is also constrained by its human capital. This human capital can be associated with the qualification and education of the health workforce. Education of the health workforce is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given in preparation for work.</p></sec><sec><title>Global factors</title><p>Economic, sociodemographic, cultural, and geographical factors contribute to shaping and transforming society and hence have a direct or indirect impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>From an economic perspective, for instance, there is evidence of a correlation between the level of economic development of a country and its level of human resources for health. Countries with higher GDP per capita are said to spend more on health care than countries with lower income, as demonstrated by cross-sectional studies, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>] and hence would also tend to have larger health workforces.</p><p>Moreover, both the demand and supply are likely to be affected by sociodemographic elements such as the age distribution of the population. On the demand side, the ageing of the population is giving rise to an increase in the demand for health services and health personnel, especially nurses for home care.</p><p>On the supply side, the ageing of the health workforce, and in particular of nurses, has serious implications for the future of the nursing labour market. For example, the Institute of Medicine noted that older registered nurses have a reduced capacity to perform certain tasks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. It was found that between 1983 and 1998 the average age of practising registered nurses increased by more than four years, from 37.4 to 41.9 years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. In contrast, the average age of the United States workforce as a whole increased by less than two years during the same period. Furthermore, the proportion of the registered-nurse workforce younger than 30 years decreased from 30.3% to 12.1% during this period.</p><p>Geographical and cultural factors also play a role in determining the demand and supply of human resources. Geographical characteristics affect the organization of health services delivery. For instance, a country with many islands or with isolated population groups will face particular challenges in terms of health workforce issues. Similarly, significant climatic changes are likely to give rise to changes in health needs, which in turn will call for changes in health services and in the health workforce. Finally, both cultural and political values also affect the demand for and supply of human resources for health.</p></sec><sec><title>Health workforce imbalances: a typology</title><p>This section considers a typology of imbalances, and differentiates between the following:</p><p>&#x02022; Profession/specialty imbalances: Under this category, we consider imbalance in the various health professions, such as doctors or nurses, as well as shortages within a profession, e.g. shortage of one type of specialists.</p><p>&#x02022; Geographical imbalances: These are disparities between urban and rural regions and poor and rich regions.</p><p>&#x02022; Institutional and services imbalances: These are differences in health workforce supply between health care facilities, as well as between services.</p><p>&#x02022; Gender imbalances: These are disparities in female/male representation in the health workforce.</p><sec><title>Profession/specialty imbalances</title><p>Imbalances have been reported for almost all health professions, and in particular for nurses. The United States General Accounting Office [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>] reports a nursing shortage. However, the nursing shortage has not been institution-wide but is concentrated in specialty care areas, particularly intensive care units and operating rooms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The shortage of registered nurses in intensive care units is explained in part by the sharp decline in the number of younger registered nurses, whom intensive care units have historically attracted. Shortages in operating rooms probably reflect that many registered nurses who work in this setting are reaching the age when they are beginning to reduce their hours worked or are retiring altogether.</p><p>Major variations occur in the number of health care workers per capita population and in the skill mix employed across countries, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor ratio varies widely from one country to another, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor skill mix is important and may have consequences for the respective tasks of nurses and doctors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that these variations are taking place among countries with a relatively similar economic development level.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of physicians, nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists in selected countries. WHO data, 2000.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-2\"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Geographical imbalances</title><p>Virtually all countries suffer from a geographical maldistribution of human resources for health, and the primary area of concern is usually the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In both industrialized and developing countries, urban areas almost invariably have a substantially higher concentration of physicians than rural areas.</p><p>Understandably, most health care professionals prefer to settle in urban areas, which offer opportunities for professional development as well as education and other amenities for themselves and their families. But it is in the rural and remote areas, especially in the developing countries, that most severe public health problems are found.</p><p>The geographical maldistribution of doctors has been the object of particular attention. In general there is a higher concentration of general practitioners in the inner suburbs of the metropolitan areas. According to the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>], the reasons for high concentration of general practitioners in inner city areas are:</p><p>&#x02022; historical</p><p>&#x02022; lifestyle-related: access to amenities</p><p>&#x02022; spouse/husband-related: greater employment opportunities</p><p>&#x02022; child-related: better access to secondary and tertiary education services</p><p>&#x02022; professional, family and social ties and professional ambitions.</p><p>The geographical distribution of health care personnel is an important issue in many countries. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, contains one-fifth of the country's population but around half of the available health personnel [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>]. In Bangladesh, most of the doctors (35%) and nurses (30%) in health services are located in four metropolitan districts where only 14.5% of the population lives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B70\">70</xref>]. This concentration pattern is characteristic of developing countries.</p><p>In Indonesia the geographical distribution of physicians is a particular concern, since Indonesia's vast size and difficult geography present a tremendous challenge to health service delivery [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B71\">71</xref>]. It is difficult to place doctors in remote islands or mountain or forest locations with few amenities, no opportunities for private practice, and poor communications with the rest of the country.</p><p>To improve the geographical distribution of physicians, governments often have used combinations of compulsory service and incentives. So far, there is virtually no country in the world that has solved the problem of a rural/urban imbalance of the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. This does not necessarily mean that policies and programmes designed to reduce the imbalance have had no effect. For example, Thailand has successfully begun to stem the migration of health professionals from rural to urban areas and from public to private facilities with a range of strong financial incentives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B72\">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Institutional and services imbalances</title><p>Institutional imbalances occur when some health care facilities have too many staff because of prestige, working conditions, ability to generate additional income, or other situation-specific factors, while others are understaffed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B73\">73</xref>]. Institutions such as magnet hospitals, for example, are hospitals characterized by adequate to excellent staffing, low turnover, rich nursing skill mix and greater job satisfaction, among other factors, even in the face of a general health personnel shortage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B74\">74</xref>].</p><p>Imbalance between the types of health services provided may also arise. In particular, we can consider the issue of curative versus preventive care. In effect, it has been estimated that most diseases (80%) and accidents are preventable through known methodologies, yet at present there is an imbalance in the funding of medical research, with only 1%-2% going to prevention and 98%-99% spent on curative approaches [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B75\">75</xref>]. This imbalance in funding raises the question of a health workforce imbalance between preventive and curative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Gender imbalances</title><p>In many countries, women still tend to concentrate in the lower-status health occupations and to be a minority among more highly trained professionals and managers. In Bangladesh, the distribution by gender of the health workforce shows that the total proportion of women accounts for little more than one-fifth in health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>]. The distribution of women by occupational category is biased in favour of nurses. Women are very poorly represented in other categories, such as dentists, medical assistants, pharmacists, managers/trainers and doctors. The underrepresentation of women in managerial and decision-making positions may lead to less attention to and poorer understanding of the problems specific to women and the particularities of their utilization patterns [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B77\">77</xref>].</p><p>Female general practitioners have been shown to practise differently from males, managing different types of medical conditions, with some differences due to patient mix and patient selectivity, and others inherent in the sex of physician. In some more traditional areas, some women will not seek care for themselves or even for their children because they do not have access to a female provider [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This framework can be used to assess policy reforms and their impact on health workforce imbalances; it also provides a common framework for cross-country comparisons. This framework emphasizes the number and type of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, illustrating the complexity of this issue. From a policy perspective, it is particularly interesting to identify factors that policy-makers can influence in order to remedy imbalance problems.</p><p>Various monetary and non-monetary incentives are used to influence the supply and/or demand for the health workforce. For example, subsidies, grants and scholarships are examples of incentives that can be used to attract more nursing students, whereas wage increases, additional benefits and working hours flexibility are examples of commonly used incentives to attract or retain the health workforce.</p><p>The numerous factors and actors involved in the health workforce imbalance issue call for a coherent health workforce vision and policy. In that context, health planning plays an important role since it contributes to shaping the health care system. Moreover, since from a societal perspective market mechanisms alone do not allow an adequate demand/supply of health personnel to be reached, public interventions such as human resources planning are a means to correct for market failures. Health planning involves a time horizon. Forecasting the future number of health personnel needed and developing policies to meet such figures are common to any health care system. Physicians represent the profession for which more planning effort has been expended to achieve a workforce of appropriate size than for any other health profession. Countries' desire to meet population health needs and to avoid social welfare losses resulting from a shortage or an oversupply are factors explaining, to a large extent, the importance attributed to planning in the context of public health policies.</p><p>The policy implications of forecasting either a shortage or a surplus of health care personnel are different, and hence attempts at projections must be rigorous. For instance, referring to previous studies predicting significant surpluses, Cooper [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B78\">78</xref>] notes that such large surpluses have not occurred so far, because of a decrease in physician work effort. Factors such as age, sex and lifestyle contributed to this evolution.</p><p>As a result of forecasted physician surpluses, various policy recommendations have been formulated. The United States Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B79\">79</xref>] published a report recommending, among other things, that there be no new medical schools, that existing schools should not increase their class size and that the number of first-year residency positions should be reduced. The Pew Health Professions Commission Report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B80\">80</xref>] issued a report recommending more severe steps, such as the closing of some medical schools and tightening the visa process for international medical graduates.</p><p>This framework also apprehends the different types of imbalances. This is important since the choice of a policy will also depend on the type of imbalance. Significant disparities in human resources for health between health occupation, regions, gender or health services are recognized as classic problems of imbalance. However, the question of a public/private imbalance is more debatable. One the one hand, we can argue that for equity and access, a health care system should have a strong public component. On the other hand, we can imagine a private-sector oriented health care system with mechanisms to ensure access to the poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of imbalances in the health workforce, this paper has discussed a framework for human resources for health and proposed a typology of imbalances. Although the term \"imbalance\" is commonly used with respect to the health workforce, it is clear that imbalance in the health workforce encompasses a wide range of possible situations and is a complex issue. The use of a framework should facilitate the development of policy tools and their assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'

        "answer": "The context documents provided do not explicitly explain how vaccines work in the immune system. However, we can infer some general principles based on the mention of vaccines in the context of COVID-19.\n\nVaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines mentioned in the documents, typically work by introducing a component of the virus (in this case, mRNA) into the body. This component stimulates the immune system to recognize and respond to the virus without causing the disease itself. The immune system then produces antibodies specifically targeted against the virus, enabling the body to respond more effectively if exposed to the actual virus in the future.\n\nThe documents highlight that these vaccines provide immunization against COVID-19, which suggests that they help the body develop an immune memory against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19. This immune memory allows for a quicker and more robust response upon subsequent exposure to the virus.\n\nMissing information includes specific details on the mechanisms of immune response triggered by vaccines, such as the role of T cells and B cells in recognizing and attacking pathogens, and how vaccines lead to the production of memory cells that provide long-term immunity. Additionally, information on how mRNA vaccines differ from traditional vaccines in their approach to immunization would enhance the understanding of their function in the immune system.",

Imbalance is not a new issue, as nursing shortages were reported in hospitals in the United States of America as early as 1915 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. It remains a major concern to this day, reported in both developed and developing countries and for most of the health care professions.</p><p>Although imbalance in the health workforce is an important issue for policy-makers, various elements contribute to obscuring policy development. First, many reports of shortages are not borne out by the evidence. Rosenfeld and Moses [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] show that an overwhelming majority of newspapers, journals and newsletter articles describing the nursing situation in the United States presume the existence of a shortage. They found that even in those areas where concrete evidence of a shortage was not available, the term \"nursing shortage\" still appeared. Second, the notion of shortage is a relative one: what is considered a nursing shortage in Europe would probably be viewed differently from an African perspective. Finally, imbalances are of different types and their impact on the health care system varies. In consequence, there is a general need to critically review the imbalance issue.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature and the development of an analytical framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition</title><p>There are various approaches to defining imbalances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. From an economic perspective, a skill imbalance (shortage/surplus) occurs when the quantity of a given skill supplied by the workforce and the quantity demanded by employers diverge at the existing market conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Labour market supplies and demands for occupational skills fluctuate continuously, so at times there will be imbalances in the labour market. In other words, a shortage/surplus is the result of a disequilibrium between the demand and supply for labour. In contrast, non-economic definitions are usually normative, i.e. there is a shortage of labour relative to defined norms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. In the case of health personnel, these definitions are based either on a value judgement &#x02013; for instance, how much care people should receive &#x02013; or on a professional determination &#x02013; such as deciding what is the appropriate number of physicians for the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature</title><p>One of the key questions regarding imbalances is how long these last: Is the imbalance temporary or permanent? In a competitive labour market, we should expect most imbalances to be resolved over time. Imbalances will tend to disappear faster the greater the reaction speed and also the greater the elasticity of supply (or demand) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. This type of imbalance (shortage or surplus) is defined as dynamic.</p><p>In contrast, a static imbalance occurs because supply does not increase or decrease; market equilibrium is therefore not achieved. For instance, wage adjustments may respond slowly to shifts in demand or supply as a result of institutional and regulatory arrangements, imperfect market competition (monopoly, monopsony) and wage-control policies. Another example is physicians' education: because of the length of time required to educate physicians, changes in available supply take a long time to react significantly. Lack of information on the state of the various labour markets can also be a factor in the speed of market adjustment. To make proper labour market decisions, households and firms must be informed of the existing market conditions across markets. They must therefore know what wages are paid and the nature and location of job openings and available workers.</p><p>Moreover, we should also differentiate between qualitative and quantitative imbalance. In a tight labour market, employers might not find the ideal candidate, but will still recruit someone. Under these conditions, the issue is the quality of job candidates rather than the quantity of people willing and able to do the job [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. From the employers' perspective, a shortage of workers exists; from the job-market perspective, the existence of a shortage could be questioned because the jobs are filled. One negative hidden impact of a qualitative shortage is the number of positions that are filled with ineffective individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A conceptual framework</title><p>To better understand the role of factors affecting health workforce imbalances and to facilitate the development of policy tools, a conceptual framework is presented in this section.</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Factors affecting health workforce imbalances are numerous and complex, but focusing on crucial elements should permit insight into the issue of health workforce imbalances. The framework is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> and contains six main components: the demand for health labour, the supply of health labour, the health care system, policies, resources and \"global\" factors.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Framework for imbalance of human resources for health</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-1\"/></fig><p>Central to this framework are the demand for and supply of health labour. Also included in the framework is the health care system, and in particular, some of its features that are likely to have an impact on health workforce imbalances. Policies constitute another crucial element of the framework. In effect, health policies but also non-health-oriented policies can have an impact on health workforce imbalances. The framework also incorporates financial, physical and knowledge resources that contribute to model the health workforce.Finally, \"global\" factors such as economic, sociodemographic, political, geographical and cultural factors are included. These elements contribute directly or indirectly to shaping and transforming the entire society and hence the health workforce.</p></sec><sec><title>The demand for health personnel</title><p>The first element of the framework to be examined is the demand for health personnel. The demand for health personnel can be considered as a derived demand for health services. Accordingly, we should consider factors determining the demand for health services. Personal characteristics &#x02013; such as health needs, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics &#x02013; and economic factors play an important role.</p><p>It has often been proposed that the planning of human resources for health be based solely on estimates of health needs in the population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. However, relying only on the concept of need is difficult, because it can be defined either broadly or restrictedly and accordingly lead to a perception of either systematic shortage or surplus. Health needs is only one of the factors affecting the demand for health personnel.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of economic factors on the demand for health care. In particular in the United States, studies have attempted to estimate price and income elasticities of demand for medical services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. Measurements of price or income elasticities make it possible to evaluate the impact of a change in price or income on the demand for health care. Most studies reported elasticities in the range between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating that consumers tend to be responsive to price changes but that the degree of price sensitivity is not very large compared to that for many other goods and services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>Another element influencing the demand for health care is the value of a patient's time, such as travel time and waiting time. Acton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] found that in the United States, elasticity of demand with respect to travel time ranged between -0.6 and -1, meaning that a 10% increase in travel time would induce a reduction of 6%-10% in the demand for health care.</p><p>Other factors affect the demand for health labour. In particular, some specific features of the health care system and its features, policies, resources and environmental factors do have an impact on the demand for health labour. Their respective role will further discussed later.</p></sec><sec><title>The supply of human resources for health</title><p>After reviewing factors affecting the demand for health labour, we shall now turn to those affecting the supply of the health workforce. In particular, we shall consider the following elements: factors affecting the choice for a health professional training/education, participation in the health labour market and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Education/professional training choice</title><p>The availability of a renewed health workforce, as well as the type of profession and specialty chosen by individuals, is a major concern for health decision-makers. These issues are of particular relevance, especially since the number of younger people, predominantly women, choosing a nursing career is declining in some countries and since in professional training/education, individuals' choices do not always match the absorptive capacity of the market.</p><p>From an economic perspective, the decision to undertake professional training/education is considered an investment decision. To emphasize the essential similarities of these investments to other kinds of investments, economists refer to them as investment in human capital [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. Since investment decisions usually deliver payoffs over time, we must consider the entire stream of costs and benefits. The expected returns on human capital investments are a higher level of earnings, greater job satisfaction over one's lifetime and a greater appreciation of non-market activities and interests.</p><p>Based on the human capital approach, rate of return on education can be estimated. An average rate of return that is high and rising for a given profession will attract more individuals to that profession. On the other hand, a lower and decreasing average rate of return will discourage individuals from choosing that profession. Nowak and Preston [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], using the human capital approach, found that Australian nurses are poorly paid in comparison to other female professionals. The declining interest in nursing can be partly explained by the expansion of career opportunities in traditionally male-dominated occupations over the last three decades that entail a higher rate of return [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The number of young women entering the registered-nurse workforce has declined because many women who would have entered nursing in the past &#x02013; particularly those with high academic ability &#x02013; are now entering managerial and professional occupations that used to be traditionally male.</p><p>Besides the human capital approach, the choice of a profession can also be explained by sociopsychological factors. For instance, individuals may choose a profession because it is highly valued by the society or for family tradition. In the health sector, the satisfaction afforded by caring for people and assisting them to improve their health is an important element used by nursing schools to attract new enrollees. In the light of this approach, the decline in the number of individuals choosing nursing as a career might also be explained by the fact that this profession is now less socially valued than before [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participation in the labour market</title><p>The economic theory of the decision to work views the decision as a choice concerning how people spend their time. Individuals face a trade-off between labour and leisure. They decide how much of their time to spend working for pay or participating in leisure activities, the latter being activities that are not work-related.</p><p>An issue that has drawn a lot of attention recently is the impact of wage increases on labour participation, in particular for nurses. In the short term, higher wages can have at least two effects on the labour supply of current qualified nurses: first, qualified nurses who are working in other occupations may return to nursing activities; second, nurses now in practice may respond by working more hours. In the long run, higher wages in nursing relative to other occupations make nursing an attractive profession and will draw more people into nurse training programmes.</p><p>In their literature review of wage elasticity of nursing labour supply, Antonazzo et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] and Chiha and Link [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] found that most of the studies indicate a positive relationship, although not a strong one, between wages and labour supply. Accordingly, increases in nursing wages are unlikely to cause significant increases in labour participation. A literature review on the women's workforce undertaken by Killingsworth and Heckman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] indicated that in addition to wage rate, women's participation is responsive to changes in unearned income, spouse's wage and having children (particularly of pre-school age). Another aspect of labour supply decisions that has been investigated by Philips [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] is the costs associated with entering the nursing labour market (such as costs of child care and housework). The elasticity of participation with respect to changes in working costs was evaluated at -0.67 for all nurses. This suggests that a subsidy leading to a decrease of 10% in these costs would increase the participation of nurses by 6.7%.</p><p>Moreover, hospitals are also using a variety of strategies to recruit new staff. A survey of hospitals in the United States shows that richer benefits, such as health insurance and vacation time, are the most common incentives used. In addition, hospitals may offer other recruitment and retention benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, flexible hours and signing bonuses based on experience or length of commitment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. Many countries, but particularly developed ones, use such incentives to recruit new staff.</p><p>Economic factors also play a role in physician's participation in the labour market, as demonstrated by the impact of cost-containment policies in Canada, where most provincial governments have implemented an assortment of controls of health care expenses. Threshold reductions were introduced, so that fees payable to individual physicians were reduced as billing exceeded an agreed threshold. As a consequence, physicians who had billed at the threshold level chose to take leaves of absence rather than receive a level of reimbursement they considered inadequate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>].</p><p>When health personnel choose an alternative or additional occupation, this is likely to have consequences on health labour supply. In developing countries, and particularly in Africa, attempts to reform the health care sector have frequently failed to respond to the aspirations of staff concerning remuneration and working conditions. Salaries are often inadequate and may be paid late, and health workers try to solve their financial problems in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Private practice is only one of the many survival strategies that health personnel use to supplement their income and increase their job satisfaction. Teaching, attending training courses, supervision activities, research, trade and agriculture are some of these alternative strategies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Labour market exit</title><p>Parker and Rickam [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] examined the economic determinants of the labour force withdrawal of registered nurses in the United States, i.e. nurses leaving the profession to pursue a non-nursing occupation and employed nurses withdrawing from the labour force. Their results suggest that a significant number of registered nurses withdraw, at least temporarily, from the labour force. Among the significant elements influencing the withdrawal decision are the wage rate, other family income, presence of children and full-time/part-time work status. Increasing registered nurses' wages and working full-time is expected to reduce the probability of labour force withdrawal, whereas higher education levels, age and other family income increase the probability of labour force withdrawal.</p><p>The relative importance of wage is also emphasized by studies investigating job satisfaction. There is support in the empirical literature for the existence of job dissatisfaction among nurses, and the link between job dissatisfaction and job exit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]. In the United States the most important factors in nurses' resignation were, in order of importance: workload, staffing, time with patients, flexible scheduling, respect from nursing administration, increasing nursing knowledge, promotion opportunities, work stimulation, salary and decision-making. These studies suggest that salary is just one of the reasons why nurses are quitting. The relative importance of wage is confirmed by Shields and Ward [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]. Their results suggest that dissatisfaction with promotion and training opportunities has a stronger impact than workload or pay.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration</title><p>Migration of health personnel can have a serious impact on the supply of human resources in health, because it may exacerbate health personnel imbalances in \"sending\" countries. It is suggested that migration is an \"individual, spontaneous and voluntary act\" that is motivated by the perceived net gain of migrating &#x02013; that is, the gain will offset the tangible and intangible costs of moving [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Decisions to migrate are often a family strategy to produce a better income and improve survival chances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>The reality for many health workers in developing countries is to be underpaid, poorly motivated and increasingly dissatisfied and sceptical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. The relevance of motivation to migration is self-evident. There can be little doubt that for many health workers an improvement in pay and conditions will act as an incentive to stay in the country. Improved pensions, child care, educational opportunities and recognition are also known to be important [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. In Ghana it is estimated that only 191 of the 489 doctors who graduated between 1985 and 1994 were still working in the country in 1997 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Health system characteristics</title><p>As the health workforce is part of the health care system, we shall also consider features of the health care system that are likely to have an impact on the demand and supply of health labour. In particular, we shall examine market failures, the diversity of stakeholders, the supply-demand adjustment time lag and hospitals' potential monopsony power.</p></sec><sec><title>Market failures</title><p>From an economic perspective, the health care market is characterized by market failures &#x02013; that is, the assumptions for perfect competition are violated. From a societal perspective, in the presence of market failures such as externalities &#x02013; imperfect knowledge, asymmetry of information and uncertainty &#x02013; market mechanisms lead to a non-optimal demand and/or supply in health services. In other words, shortages and surpluses are likely to result from the health care market.</p><p>Most markets are characterized by market failures, but what is unique to the health services market is the extent of these market failures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Governments try to correct health care market failures through policy interventions. A classic example of public intervention in the presence of a positive externality is the introduction of a policy of mandatory vaccination. However, implementing such policies is sometimes difficult and may result in only partial correction of the market failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Stakeholders</title><p>The health care system is characterized by a wide range of institutional stakeholders involved in shaping human resources for health, all of whom may have different objectives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. The objectives of a union or professional association do not necessarily coincide, for example, with those of a government ministry, a hospital manager or the central government. Unions/professional associations seek to increase their members' market power, employment and income [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], whereas the ministry of finance will want more budget equilibrium and will favour measures to limit health care expenditures.</p><p>In the case of Mozambique, whereas the policy of employing national professionals by cooperation agencies has met with warm support from national cadres, its effect on the health sector is problematic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. The prospect of immediate financial gains puts pressure on qualified professionals to leave their posts within the Mozambique National Health Service to take up management or consultant positions. The substantial investment in their training is therefore producing dubious direct returns to the National Health Service. More seriously perhaps, the presence of donor-paid jobs outside the health sector (as programme coordinators, researchers, etc.) is creating pressure on the Ministry of Health itself, exacerbating the imbalances in the National Health Service and creating incentives for trained Mozambicans to leave the public sector.</p></sec><sec><title>Time lag</title><p>Moreover, adjustments between the demand and supply for health personnel may take a long time. In the health care field; the time lag between education and practising may be quite substantial. To obtain licensure to practise medicine requires lengthy education and training, and the long lag time between a changed student intake and a change in supply has been noted [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]: supply adjustment for physicians is not immediate, but takes a long time.</p></sec><sec><title>Hospitals' potential monopsony power</title><p>A single entity that is the sole purchaser of labour is a <italic>monopsony</italic>. One example is the potential monopsony power of hospitals in hiring nurses or the ministry of health in hiring the health workforce. The amount of labour demanded will influence the price the monopsonist must pay for it. In contrast to the situation in a competitive market, the monopsony is a price maker, not a price taker. Monopsony results in lower wages and lower employment of nurses compared to a competitive market.</p><p>A number of studies have tested whether or not hospitals possess monopsony power with respect to nurses, and the results are contradictory. Sullivan [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>] and Staiger et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>] concluded that hospitals have a substantial degree of monopsony power. In contrast, Hirsch and Schumacher [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>] did not find empirical support for the monopsony model. Nurses' wages were found not to be related to hospital density and to decrease rather than increase with respect to labour market size.</p></sec><sec><title>Provider power/monopoly</title><p>In contrast, providers' power may enable the latter to restrict the supply of human resources for health. Seldon, Jung and Cavazos [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such avenues as restricting supply and price-fixing. In France, trade unions are granted an institutional role at establishment level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. In India and Sri Lanka, a clear constraint to support-services contracting was the inability to counter the power of the public service unions in dictating employment terms and conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. The varying degree of homogeneity of the different professional groups may also explain their relative success in maintaining a monopoly of practice. In Iceland, one of the factors that contributed to breaking the professional monopoly of pharmacists was division within the profession [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Regulations</title><p>The type off regulation associated with a profession plays an important role regarding the supply of members of a profession. Regulation has, by tradition, been achieved through a combination of direct government regulation and, to a large extent, through rules adopted by professional associations, whose self-regulatory powers enable them to establish both entry requirements and rules regarding professional conduct [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>].</p><p>Such barriers to entry exist in particular for doctors, but also in other health professions, such as dentistry. Some argue that these barriers constitute a means to limit entry into the profession, and hence maintain high incomes. Muzondo and Pazderka [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] established, for Canadian professional licensing restrictions, a relationship between different variables of self-regulation and higher income. Seldon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such sources as restricting supply and price-fixing. However, the proponents of self-regulation claim that these barriers are a means to provide health care of quality and to protect patients from incompetent providers. In contrast, although most countries have a professional nursing association, nurses tend to have limited power to regulate entry to the profession. This could be associated with a large diversity of specialist groups in nursing failing to unite on issues related to professional regulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Health and non-health policies</title><p>Health and non-health policies contribute to shaping the health care system and have an influence on the demand and supply of health labour.</p><p>Health policy can be defined as a formal statement or procedure within institutions (notably government) that defines priorities and the parameters for action in response to health needs, available resources and other political pressures. Health policy is often enacted through legislation or other forms of rule-making that create regulations and incentives for providing health services and programmes and access to them. For instance, the decision to introduce or expand health insurance coverage is likely to have an impact on the demand for health services. This is illustrated by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, a controlled experiment that increased knowledge about the effect of different insurance copayments on use of medical services. Insurance copayments ranged from zero to 95%. The RAND study concluded that as the co-insurance rose, overall use and expenditure fell for adults and children combined [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>].</p><p>Non-health policies reflect state interventions in areas such as employment, education and regional development that contribute to shaping the health workforce. These policies do not directly address health issues, but have an indirect impact on such issues. In France, a controversial new regulation was introduced that reduced the workweek to a maximum of 35 hours in an attempt both to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and to achieve greater flexibility in the labour force. Unions responded by demanding the creation of more posts in public hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial, physical and knowledge resources</title><p>Financial, physical and knowledge resources are crucial to any type of health care workforce. The level of resources attributed to the health care system, and how these resources are used, will have a significant impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>In terms of financial resources, human resources account for a high proportion of national budgets assigned to the health sector [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Health expenditure claims an increasingly important share of the gross domestic product and, in most countries, wage costs (salaries, bonuses and other payments) are estimated to account for between 65% and 80% of the renewable health system expenditure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>].</p><p>Physical resources include human resources within the health sector and other sectors; buildings and engineering services such as sanitation, water and heating systems for community use and for the use of medical care institutions; and equipment and supplies. Finally, the health workforce is also constrained by its human capital. This human capital can be associated with the qualification and education of the health workforce. Education of the health workforce is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given in preparation for work.</p></sec><sec><title>Global factors</title><p>Economic, sociodemographic, cultural, and geographical factors contribute to shaping and transforming society and hence have a direct or indirect impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>From an economic perspective, for instance, there is evidence of a correlation between the level of economic development of a country and its level of human resources for health. Countries with higher GDP per capita are said to spend more on health care than countries with lower income, as demonstrated by cross-sectional studies, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>] and hence would also tend to have larger health workforces.</p><p>Moreover, both the demand and supply are likely to be affected by sociodemographic elements such as the age distribution of the population. On the demand side, the ageing of the population is giving rise to an increase in the demand for health services and health personnel, especially nurses for home care.</p><p>On the supply side, the ageing of the health workforce, and in particular of nurses, has serious implications for the future of the nursing labour market. For example, the Institute of Medicine noted that older registered nurses have a reduced capacity to perform certain tasks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. It was found that between 1983 and 1998 the average age of practising registered nurses increased by more than four years, from 37.4 to 41.9 years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. In contrast, the average age of the United States workforce as a whole increased by less than two years during the same period. Furthermore, the proportion of the registered-nurse workforce younger than 30 years decreased from 30.3% to 12.1% during this period.</p><p>Geographical and cultural factors also play a role in determining the demand and supply of human resources. Geographical characteristics affect the organization of health services delivery. For instance, a country with many islands or with isolated population groups will face particular challenges in terms of health workforce issues. Similarly, significant climatic changes are likely to give rise to changes in health needs, which in turn will call for changes in health services and in the health workforce. Finally, both cultural and political values also affect the demand for and supply of human resources for health.</p></sec><sec><title>Health workforce imbalances: a typology</title><p>This section considers a typology of imbalances, and differentiates between the following:</p><p>&#x02022; Profession/specialty imbalances: Under this category, we consider imbalance in the various health professions, such as doctors or nurses, as well as shortages within a profession, e.g. shortage of one type of specialists.</p><p>&#x02022; Geographical imbalances: These are disparities between urban and rural regions and poor and rich regions.</p><p>&#x02022; Institutional and services imbalances: These are differences in health workforce supply between health care facilities, as well as between services.</p><p>&#x02022; Gender imbalances: These are disparities in female/male representation in the health workforce.</p><sec><title>Profession/specialty imbalances</title><p>Imbalances have been reported for almost all health professions, and in particular for nurses. The United States General Accounting Office [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>] reports a nursing shortage. However, the nursing shortage has not been institution-wide but is concentrated in specialty care areas, particularly intensive care units and operating rooms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The shortage of registered nurses in intensive care units is explained in part by the sharp decline in the number of younger registered nurses, whom intensive care units have historically attracted. Shortages in operating rooms probably reflect that many registered nurses who work in this setting are reaching the age when they are beginning to reduce their hours worked or are retiring altogether.</p><p>Major variations occur in the number of health care workers per capita population and in the skill mix employed across countries, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor ratio varies widely from one country to another, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor skill mix is important and may have consequences for the respective tasks of nurses and doctors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that these variations are taking place among countries with a relatively similar economic development level.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of physicians, nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists in selected countries. WHO data, 2000.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-2\"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Geographical imbalances</title><p>Virtually all countries suffer from a geographical maldistribution of human resources for health, and the primary area of concern is usually the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In both industrialized and developing countries, urban areas almost invariably have a substantially higher concentration of physicians than rural areas.</p><p>Understandably, most health care professionals prefer to settle in urban areas, which offer opportunities for professional development as well as education and other amenities for themselves and their families. But it is in the rural and remote areas, especially in the developing countries, that most severe public health problems are found.</p><p>The geographical maldistribution of doctors has been the object of particular attention. In general there is a higher concentration of general practitioners in the inner suburbs of the metropolitan areas. According to the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>], the reasons for high concentration of general practitioners in inner city areas are:</p><p>&#x02022; historical</p><p>&#x02022; lifestyle-related: access to amenities</p><p>&#x02022; spouse/husband-related: greater employment opportunities</p><p>&#x02022; child-related: better access to secondary and tertiary education services</p><p>&#x02022; professional, family and social ties and professional ambitions.</p><p>The geographical distribution of health care personnel is an important issue in many countries. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, contains one-fifth of the country's population but around half of the available health personnel [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>]. In Bangladesh, most of the doctors (35%) and nurses (30%) in health services are located in four metropolitan districts where only 14.5% of the population lives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B70\">70</xref>]. This concentration pattern is characteristic of developing countries.</p><p>In Indonesia the geographical distribution of physicians is a particular concern, since Indonesia's vast size and difficult geography present a tremendous challenge to health service delivery [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B71\">71</xref>]. It is difficult to place doctors in remote islands or mountain or forest locations with few amenities, no opportunities for private practice, and poor communications with the rest of the country.</p><p>To improve the geographical distribution of physicians, governments often have used combinations of compulsory service and incentives. So far, there is virtually no country in the world that has solved the problem of a rural/urban imbalance of the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. This does not necessarily mean that policies and programmes designed to reduce the imbalance have had no effect. For example, Thailand has successfully begun to stem the migration of health professionals from rural to urban areas and from public to private facilities with a range of strong financial incentives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B72\">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Institutional and services imbalances</title><p>Institutional imbalances occur when some health care facilities have too many staff because of prestige, working conditions, ability to generate additional income, or other situation-specific factors, while others are understaffed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B73\">73</xref>]. Institutions such as magnet hospitals, for example, are hospitals characterized by adequate to excellent staffing, low turnover, rich nursing skill mix and greater job satisfaction, among other factors, even in the face of a general health personnel shortage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B74\">74</xref>].</p><p>Imbalance between the types of health services provided may also arise. In particular, we can consider the issue of curative versus preventive care. In effect, it has been estimated that most diseases (80%) and accidents are preventable through known methodologies, yet at present there is an imbalance in the funding of medical research, with only 1%-2% going to prevention and 98%-99% spent on curative approaches [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B75\">75</xref>]. This imbalance in funding raises the question of a health workforce imbalance between preventive and curative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Gender imbalances</title><p>In many countries, women still tend to concentrate in the lower-status health occupations and to be a minority among more highly trained professionals and managers. In Bangladesh, the distribution by gender of the health workforce shows that the total proportion of women accounts for little more than one-fifth in health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>]. The distribution of women by occupational category is biased in favour of nurses. Women are very poorly represented in other categories, such as dentists, medical assistants, pharmacists, managers/trainers and doctors. The underrepresentation of women in managerial and decision-making positions may lead to less attention to and poorer understanding of the problems specific to women and the particularities of their utilization patterns [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B77\">77</xref>].</p><p>Female general practitioners have been shown to practise differently from males, managing different types of medical conditions, with some differences due to patient mix and patient selectivity, and others inherent in the sex of physician. In some more traditional areas, some women will not seek care for themselves or even for their children because they do not have access to a female provider [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This framework can be used to assess policy reforms and their impact on health workforce imbalances; it also provides a common framework for cross-country comparisons. This framework emphasizes the number and type of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, illustrating the complexity of this issue. From a policy perspective, it is particularly interesting to identify factors that policy-makers can influence in order to remedy imbalance problems.</p><p>Various monetary and non-monetary incentives are used to influence the supply and/or demand for the health workforce. For example, subsidies, grants and scholarships are examples of incentives that can be used to attract more nursing students, whereas wage increases, additional benefits and working hours flexibility are examples of commonly used incentives to attract or retain the health workforce.</p><p>The numerous factors and actors involved in the health workforce imbalance issue call for a coherent health workforce vision and policy. In that context, health planning plays an important role since it contributes to shaping the health care system. Moreover, since from a societal perspective market mechanisms alone do not allow an adequate demand/supply of health personnel to be reached, public interventions such as human resources planning are a means to correct for market failures. Health planning involves a time horizon. Forecasting the future number of health personnel needed and developing policies to meet such figures are common to any health care system. Physicians represent the profession for which more planning effort has been expended to achieve a workforce of appropriate size than for any other health profession. Countries' desire to meet population health needs and to avoid social welfare losses resulting from a shortage or an oversupply are factors explaining, to a large extent, the importance attributed to planning in the context of public health policies.</p><p>The policy implications of forecasting either a shortage or a surplus of health care personnel are different, and hence attempts at projections must be rigorous. For instance, referring to previous studies predicting significant surpluses, Cooper [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B78\">78</xref>] notes that such large surpluses have not occurred so far, because of a decrease in physician work effort. Factors such as age, sex and lifestyle contributed to this evolution.</p><p>As a result of forecasted physician surpluses, various policy recommendations have been formulated. The United States Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B79\">79</xref>] published a report recommending, among other things, that there be no new medical schools, that existing schools should not increase their class size and that the number of first-year residency positions should be reduced. The Pew Health Professions Commission Report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B80\">80</xref>] issued a report recommending more severe steps, such as the closing of some medical schools and tightening the visa process for international medical graduates.</p><p>This framework also apprehends the different types of imbalances. This is important since the choice of a policy will also depend on the type of imbalance. Significant disparities in human resources for health between health occupation, regions, gender or health services are recognized as classic problems of imbalance. However, the question of a public/private imbalance is more debatable. One the one hand, we can argue that for equity and access, a health care system should have a strong public component. On the other hand, we can imagine a private-sector oriented health care system with mechanisms to ensure access to the poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of imbalances in the health workforce, this paper has discussed a framework for human resources for health and proposed a typology of imbalances. Although the term \"imbalance\" is commonly used with respect to the health workforce, it is clear that imbalance in the health workforce encompasses a wide range of possible situations and is a complex issue. The use of a framework should facilitate the development of policy tools and their assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'

It is a complex issue that encompasses a wide range of possible situations. This paper aims to contribute not only to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature, but also to the development of an analytical framework. The framework emphasizes the number and types of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, and facilitates the development of policy tools and their assessment. Moreover, to facilitate comparisons between health workforce imbalances, a typology of imbalances is proposed that differentiates between profession/specialty imbalances, geographical imbalances, institutional and services imbalances and gender imbalances.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Imbalance in the health workforce is a major challenge for health policy-makers, since human resources &#x02013; the different kinds of clinical and non-clinical staff who make each individual and public health intervention happen &#x02013; are the most important of the health system's inputs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. Imbalance is not a new issue, as nursing shortages were reported in hospitals in the United States of America as early as 1915 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. It remains a major concern to this day, reported in both developed and developing countries and for most of the health care professions.</p><p>Although imbalance in the health workforce is an important issue for policy-makers, various elements contribute to obscuring policy development. First, many reports of shortages are not borne out by the evidence. Rosenfeld and Moses [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] show that an overwhelming majority of newspapers, journals and newsletter articles describing the nursing situation in the United States presume the existence of a shortage. They found that even in those areas where concrete evidence of a shortage was not available, the term \"nursing shortage\" still appeared. Second, the notion of shortage is a relative one: what is considered a nursing shortage in Europe would probably be viewed differently from an African perspective. Finally, imbalances are of different types and their impact on the health care system varies. In consequence, there is a general need to critically review the imbalance issue.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature and the development of an analytical framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition</title><p>There are various approaches to defining imbalances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. From an economic perspective, a skill imbalance (shortage/surplus) occurs when the quantity of a given skill supplied by the workforce and the quantity demanded by employers diverge at the existing market conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Labour market supplies and demands for occupational skills fluctuate continuously, so at times there will be imbalances in the labour market. In other words, a shortage/surplus is the result of a disequilibrium between the demand and supply for labour. In contrast, non-economic definitions are usually normative, i.e. there is a shortage of labour relative to defined norms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. In the case of health personnel, these definitions are based either on a value judgement &#x02013; for instance, how much care people should receive &#x02013; or on a professional determination &#x02013; such as deciding what is the appropriate number of physicians for the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature</title><p>One of the key questions regarding imbalances is how long these last: Is the imbalance temporary or permanent? In a competitive labour market, we should expect most imbalances to be resolved over time. Imbalances will tend to disappear faster the greater the reaction speed and also the greater the elasticity of supply (or demand) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. This type of imbalance (shortage or surplus) is defined as dynamic.</p><p>In contrast, a static imbalance occurs because supply does not increase or decrease; market equilibrium is therefore not achieved. For instance, wage adjustments may respond slowly to shifts in demand or supply as a result of institutional and regulatory arrangements, imperfect market competition (monopoly, monopsony) and wage-control policies. Another example is physicians' education: because of the length of time required to educate physicians, changes in available supply take a long time to react significantly. Lack of information on the state of the various labour markets can also be a factor in the speed of market adjustment. To make proper labour market decisions, households and firms must be informed of the existing market conditions across markets. They must therefore know what wages are paid and the nature and location of job openings and available workers.</p><p>Moreover, we should also differentiate between qualitative and quantitative imbalance. In a tight labour market, employers might not find the ideal candidate, but will still recruit someone. Under these conditions, the issue is the quality of job candidates rather than the quantity of people willing and able to do the job [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. From the employers' perspective, a shortage of workers exists; from the job-market perspective, the existence of a shortage could be questioned because the jobs are filled. One negative hidden impact of a qualitative shortage is the number of positions that are filled with ineffective individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A conceptual framework</title><p>To better understand the role of factors affecting health workforce imbalances and to facilitate the development of policy tools, a conceptual framework is presented in this section.</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Factors affecting health workforce imbalances are numerous and complex, but focusing on crucial elements should permit insight into the issue of health workforce imbalances. The framework is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> and contains six main components: the demand for health labour, the supply of health labour, the health care system, policies, resources and \"global\" factors.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Framework for imbalance of human resources for health</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-1\"/></fig><p>Central to this framework are the demand for and supply of health labour. Also included in the framework is the health care system, and in particular, some of its features that are likely to have an impact on health workforce imbalances. Policies constitute another crucial element of the framework. In effect, health policies but also non-health-oriented policies can have an impact on health workforce imbalances. The framework also incorporates financial, physical and knowledge resources that contribute to model the health workforce.Finally, \"global\" factors such as economic, sociodemographic, political, geographical and cultural factors are included. These elements contribute directly or indirectly to shaping and transforming the entire society and hence the health workforce.</p></sec><sec><title>The demand for health personnel</title><p>The first element of the framework to be examined is the demand for health personnel. The demand for health personnel can be considered as a derived demand for health services. Accordingly, we should consider factors determining the demand for health services. Personal characteristics &#x02013; such as health needs, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics &#x02013; and economic factors play an important role.</p><p>It has often been proposed that the planning of human resources for health be based solely on estimates of health needs in the population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. However, relying only on the concept of need is difficult, because it can be defined either broadly or restrictedly and accordingly lead to a perception of either systematic shortage or surplus. Health needs is only one of the factors affecting the demand for health personnel.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of economic factors on the demand for health care. In particular in the United States, studies have attempted to estimate price and income elasticities of demand for medical services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. Measurements of price or income elasticities make it possible to evaluate the impact of a change in price or income on the demand for health care. Most studies reported elasticities in the range between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating that consumers tend to be responsive to price changes but that the degree of price sensitivity is not very large compared to that for many other goods and services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>Another element influencing the demand for health care is the value of a patient's time, such as travel time and waiting time. Acton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] found that in the United States, elasticity of demand with respect to travel time ranged between -0.6 and -1, meaning that a 10% increase in travel time would induce a reduction of 6%-10% in the demand for health care.</p><p>Other factors affect the demand for health labour. In particular, some specific features of the health care system and its features, policies, resources and environmental factors do have an impact on the demand for health labour. Their respective role will further discussed later.</p></sec><sec><title>The supply of human resources for health</title><p>After reviewing factors affecting the demand for health labour, we shall now turn to those affecting the supply of the health workforce. In particular, we shall consider the following elements: factors affecting the choice for a health professional training/education, participation in the health labour market and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Education/professional training choice</title><p>The availability of a renewed health workforce, as well as the type of profession and specialty chosen by individuals, is a major concern for health decision-makers. These issues are of particular relevance, especially since the number of younger people, predominantly women, choosing a nursing career is declining in some countries and since in professional training/education, individuals' choices do not always match the absorptive capacity of the market.</p><p>From an economic perspective, the decision to undertake professional training/education is considered an investment decision. To emphasize the essential similarities of these investments to other kinds of investments, economists refer to them as investment in human capital [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. Since investment decisions usually deliver payoffs over time, we must consider the entire stream of costs and benefits. The expected returns on human capital investments are a higher level of earnings, greater job satisfaction over one's lifetime and a greater appreciation of non-market activities and interests.</p><p>Based on the human capital approach, rate of return on education can be estimated. An average rate of return that is high and rising for a given profession will attract more individuals to that profession. On the other hand, a lower and decreasing average rate of return will discourage individuals from choosing that profession. Nowak and Preston [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], using the human capital approach, found that Australian nurses are poorly paid in comparison to other female professionals. The declining interest in nursing can be partly explained by the expansion of career opportunities in traditionally male-dominated occupations over the last three decades that entail a higher rate of return [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The number of young women entering the registered-nurse workforce has declined because many women who would have entered nursing in the past &#x02013; particularly those with high academic ability &#x02013; are now entering managerial and professional occupations that used to be traditionally male.</p><p>Besides the human capital approach, the choice of a profession can also be explained by sociopsychological factors. For instance, individuals may choose a profession because it is highly valued by the society or for family tradition. In the health sector, the satisfaction afforded by caring for people and assisting them to improve their health is an important element used by nursing schools to attract new enrollees. In the light of this approach, the decline in the number of individuals choosing nursing as a career might also be explained by the fact that this profession is now less socially valued than before [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participation in the labour market</title><p>The economic theory of the decision to work views the decision as a choice concerning how people spend their time. Individuals face a trade-off between labour and leisure. They decide how much of their time to spend working for pay or participating in leisure activities, the latter being activities that are not work-related.</p><p>An issue that has drawn a lot of attention recently is the impact of wage increases on labour participation, in particular for nurses. In the short term, higher wages can have at least two effects on the labour supply of current qualified nurses: first, qualified nurses who are working in other occupations may return to nursing activities; second, nurses now in practice may respond by working more hours. In the long run, higher wages in nursing relative to other occupations make nursing an attractive profession and will draw more people into nurse training programmes.</p><p>In their literature review of wage elasticity of nursing labour supply, Antonazzo et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] and Chiha and Link [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] found that most of the studies indicate a positive relationship, although not a strong one, between wages and labour supply. Accordingly, increases in nursing wages are unlikely to cause significant increases in labour participation. A literature review on the women's workforce undertaken by Killingsworth and Heckman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] indicated that in addition to wage rate, women's participation is responsive to changes in unearned income, spouse's wage and having children (particularly of pre-school age). Another aspect of labour supply decisions that has been investigated by Philips [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] is the costs associated with entering the nursing labour market (such as costs of child care and housework). The elasticity of participation with respect to changes in working costs was evaluated at -0.67 for all nurses. This suggests that a subsidy leading to a decrease of 10% in these costs would increase the participation of nurses by 6.7%.</p><p>Moreover, hospitals are also using a variety of strategies to recruit new staff. A survey of hospitals in the United States shows that richer benefits, such as health insurance and vacation time, are the most common incentives used. In addition, hospitals may offer other recruitment and retention benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, flexible hours and signing bonuses based on experience or length of commitment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. Many countries, but particularly developed ones, use such incentives to recruit new staff.</p><p>Economic factors also play a role in physician's participation in the labour market, as demonstrated by the impact of cost-containment policies in Canada, where most provincial governments have implemented an assortment of controls of health care expenses. Threshold reductions were introduced, so that fees payable to individual physicians were reduced as billing exceeded an agreed threshold. As a consequence, physicians who had billed at the threshold level chose to take leaves of absence rather than receive a level of reimbursement they considered inadequate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>].</p><p>When health personnel choose an alternative or additional occupation, this is likely to have consequences on health labour supply. In developing countries, and particularly in Africa, attempts to reform the health care sector have frequently failed to respond to the aspirations of staff concerning remuneration and working conditions. Salaries are often inadequate and may be paid late, and health workers try to solve their financial problems in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Private practice is only one of the many survival strategies that health personnel use to supplement their income and increase their job satisfaction. Teaching, attending training courses, supervision activities, research, trade and agriculture are some of these alternative strategies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Labour market exit</title><p>Parker and Rickam [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] examined the economic determinants of the labour force withdrawal of registered nurses in the United States, i.e. nurses leaving the profession to pursue a non-nursing occupation and employed nurses withdrawing from the labour force. Their results suggest that a significant number of registered nurses withdraw, at least temporarily, from the labour force. Among the significant elements influencing the withdrawal decision are the wage rate, other family income, presence of children and full-time/part-time work status. Increasing registered nurses' wages and working full-time is expected to reduce the probability of labour force withdrawal, whereas higher education levels, age and other family income increase the probability of labour force withdrawal.</p><p>The relative importance of wage is also emphasized by studies investigating job satisfaction. There is support in the empirical literature for the existence of job dissatisfaction among nurses, and the link between job dissatisfaction and job exit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]. In the United States the most important factors in nurses' resignation were, in order of importance: workload, staffing, time with patients, flexible scheduling, respect from nursing administration, increasing nursing knowledge, promotion opportunities, work stimulation, salary and decision-making. These studies suggest that salary is just one of the reasons why nurses are quitting. The relative importance of wage is confirmed by Shields and Ward [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]. Their results suggest that dissatisfaction with promotion and training opportunities has a stronger impact than workload or pay.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration</title><p>Migration of health personnel can have a serious impact on the supply of human resources in health, because it may exacerbate health personnel imbalances in \"sending\" countries. It is suggested that migration is an \"individual, spontaneous and voluntary act\" that is motivated by the perceived net gain of migrating &#x02013; that is, the gain will offset the tangible and intangible costs of moving [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Decisions to migrate are often a family strategy to produce a better income and improve survival chances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>The reality for many health workers in developing countries is to be underpaid, poorly motivated and increasingly dissatisfied and sceptical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. The relevance of motivation to migration is self-evident. There can be little doubt that for many health workers an improvement in pay and conditions will act as an incentive to stay in the country. Improved pensions, child care, educational opportunities and recognition are also known to be important [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. In Ghana it is estimated that only 191 of the 489 doctors who graduated between 1985 and 1994 were still working in the country in 1997 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Health system characteristics</title><p>As the health workforce is part of the health care system, we shall also consider features of the health care system that are likely to have an impact on the demand and supply of health labour. In particular, we shall examine market failures, the diversity of stakeholders, the supply-demand adjustment time lag and hospitals' potential monopsony power.</p></sec><sec><title>Market failures</title><p>From an economic perspective, the health care market is characterized by market failures &#x02013; that is, the assumptions for perfect competition are violated. From a societal perspective, in the presence of market failures such as externalities &#x02013; imperfect knowledge, asymmetry of information and uncertainty &#x02013; market mechanisms lead to a non-optimal demand and/or supply in health services. In other words, shortages and surpluses are likely to result from the health care market.</p><p>Most markets are characterized by market failures, but what is unique to the health services market is the extent of these market failures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Governments try to correct health care market failures through policy interventions. A classic example of public intervention in the presence of a positive externality is the introduction of a policy of mandatory vaccination. However, implementing such policies is sometimes difficult and may result in only partial correction of the market failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Stakeholders</title><p>The health care system is characterized by a wide range of institutional stakeholders involved in shaping human resources for health, all of whom may have different objectives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. The objectives of a union or professional association do not necessarily coincide, for example, with those of a government ministry, a hospital manager or the central government. Unions/professional associations seek to increase their members' market power, employment and income [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], whereas the ministry of finance will want more budget equilibrium and will favour measures to limit health care expenditures.</p><p>In the case of Mozambique, whereas the policy of employing national professionals by cooperation agencies has met with warm support from national cadres, its effect on the health sector is problematic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. The prospect of immediate financial gains puts pressure on qualified professionals to leave their posts within the Mozambique National Health Service to take up management or consultant positions. The substantial investment in their training is therefore producing dubious direct returns to the National Health Service. More seriously perhaps, the presence of donor-paid jobs outside the health sector (as programme coordinators, researchers, etc.) is creating pressure on the Ministry of Health itself, exacerbating the imbalances in the National Health Service and creating incentives for trained Mozambicans to leave the public sector.</p></sec><sec><title>Time lag</title><p>Moreover, adjustments between the demand and supply for health personnel may take a long time. In the health care field; the time lag between education and practising may be quite substantial. To obtain licensure to practise medicine requires lengthy education and training, and the long lag time between a changed student intake and a change in supply has been noted [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]: supply adjustment for physicians is not immediate, but takes a long time.</p></sec><sec><title>Hospitals' potential monopsony power</title><p>A single entity that is the sole purchaser of labour is a <italic>monopsony</italic>. One example is the potential monopsony power of hospitals in hiring nurses or the ministry of health in hiring the health workforce. The amount of labour demanded will influence the price the monopsonist must pay for it. In contrast to the situation in a competitive market, the monopsony is a price maker, not a price taker. Monopsony results in lower wages and lower employment of nurses compared to a competitive market.</p><p>A number of studies have tested whether or not hospitals possess monopsony power with respect to nurses, and the results are contradictory. Sullivan [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>] and Staiger et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>] concluded that hospitals have a substantial degree of monopsony power. In contrast, Hirsch and Schumacher [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>] did not find empirical support for the monopsony model. Nurses' wages were found not to be related to hospital density and to decrease rather than increase with respect to labour market size.</p></sec><sec><title>Provider power/monopoly</title><p>In contrast, providers' power may enable the latter to restrict the supply of human resources for health. Seldon, Jung and Cavazos [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such avenues as restricting supply and price-fixing. In France, trade unions are granted an institutional role at establishment level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. In India and Sri Lanka, a clear constraint to support-services contracting was the inability to counter the power of the public service unions in dictating employment terms and conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. The varying degree of homogeneity of the different professional groups may also explain their relative success in maintaining a monopoly of practice. In Iceland, one of the factors that contributed to breaking the professional monopoly of pharmacists was division within the profession [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Regulations</title><p>The type off regulation associated with a profession plays an important role regarding the supply of members of a profession. Regulation has, by tradition, been achieved through a combination of direct government regulation and, to a large extent, through rules adopted by professional associations, whose self-regulatory powers enable them to establish both entry requirements and rules regarding professional conduct [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>].</p><p>Such barriers to entry exist in particular for doctors, but also in other health professions, such as dentistry. Some argue that these barriers constitute a means to limit entry into the profession, and hence maintain high incomes. Muzondo and Pazderka [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] established, for Canadian professional licensing restrictions, a relationship between different variables of self-regulation and higher income. Seldon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such sources as restricting supply and price-fixing. However, the proponents of self-regulation claim that these barriers are a means to provide health care of quality and to protect patients from incompetent providers. In contrast, although most countries have a professional nursing association, nurses tend to have limited power to regulate entry to the profession. This could be associated with a large diversity of specialist groups in nursing failing to unite on issues related to professional regulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Health and non-health policies</title><p>Health and non-health policies contribute to shaping the health care system and have an influence on the demand and supply of health labour.</p><p>Health policy can be defined as a formal statement or procedure within institutions (notably government) that defines priorities and the parameters for action in response to health needs, available resources and other political pressures. Health policy is often enacted through legislation or other forms of rule-making that create regulations and incentives for providing health services and programmes and access to them. For instance, the decision to introduce or expand health insurance coverage is likely to have an impact on the demand for health services. This is illustrated by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, a controlled experiment that increased knowledge about the effect of different insurance copayments on use of medical services. Insurance copayments ranged from zero to 95%. The RAND study concluded that as the co-insurance rose, overall use and expenditure fell for adults and children combined [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>].</p><p>Non-health policies reflect state interventions in areas such as employment, education and regional development that contribute to shaping the health workforce. These policies do not directly address health issues, but have an indirect impact on such issues. In France, a controversial new regulation was introduced that reduced the workweek to a maximum of 35 hours in an attempt both to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and to achieve greater flexibility in the labour force. Unions responded by demanding the creation of more posts in public hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial, physical and knowledge resources</title><p>Financial, physical and knowledge resources are crucial to any type of health care workforce. The level of resources attributed to the health care system, and how these resources are used, will have a significant impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>In terms of financial resources, human resources account for a high proportion of national budgets assigned to the health sector [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Health expenditure claims an increasingly important share of the gross domestic product and, in most countries, wage costs (salaries, bonuses and other payments) are estimated to account for between 65% and 80% of the renewable health system expenditure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>].</p><p>Physical resources include human resources within the health sector and other sectors; buildings and engineering services such as sanitation, water and heating systems for community use and for the use of medical care institutions; and equipment and supplies. Finally, the health workforce is also constrained by its human capital. This human capital can be associated with the qualification and education of the health workforce. Education of the health workforce is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given in preparation for work.</p></sec><sec><title>Global factors</title><p>Economic, sociodemographic, cultural, and geographical factors contribute to shaping and transforming society and hence have a direct or indirect impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>From an economic perspective, for instance, there is evidence of a correlation between the level of economic development of a country and its level of human resources for health. Countries with higher GDP per capita are said to spend more on health care than countries with lower income, as demonstrated by cross-sectional studies, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>] and hence would also tend to have larger health workforces.</p><p>Moreover, both the demand and supply are likely to be affected by sociodemographic elements such as the age distribution of the population. On the demand side, the ageing of the population is giving rise to an increase in the demand for health services and health personnel, especially nurses for home care.</p><p>On the supply side, the ageing of the health workforce, and in particular of nurses, has serious implications for the future of the nursing labour market. For example, the Institute of Medicine noted that older registered nurses have a reduced capacity to perform certain tasks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. It was found that between 1983 and 1998 the average age of practising registered nurses increased by more than four years, from 37.4 to 41.9 years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. In contrast, the average age of the United States workforce as a whole increased by less than two years during the same period. Furthermore, the proportion of the registered-nurse workforce younger than 30 years decreased from 30.3% to 12.1% during this period.</p><p>Geographical and cultural factors also play a role in determining the demand and supply of human resources. Geographical characteristics affect the organization of health services delivery. For instance, a country with many islands or with isolated population groups will face particular challenges in terms of health workforce issues. Similarly, significant climatic changes are likely to give rise to changes in health needs, which in turn will call for changes in health services and in the health workforce. Finally, both cultural and political values also affect the demand for and supply of human resources for health.</p></sec><sec><title>Health workforce imbalances: a typology</title><p>This section considers a typology of imbalances, and differentiates between the following:</p><p>&#x02022; Profession/specialty imbalances: Under this category, we consider imbalance in the various health professions, such as doctors or nurses, as well as shortages within a profession, e.g. shortage of one type of specialists.</p><p>&#x02022; Geographical imbalances: These are disparities between urban and rural regions and poor and rich regions.</p><p>&#x02022; Institutional and services imbalances: These are differences in health workforce supply between health care facilities, as well as between services.</p><p>&#x02022; Gender imbalances: These are disparities in female/male representation in the health workforce.</p><sec><title>Profession/specialty imbalances</title><p>Imbalances have been reported for almost all health professions, and in particular for nurses. The United States General Accounting Office [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>] reports a nursing shortage. However, the nursing shortage has not been institution-wide but is concentrated in specialty care areas, particularly intensive care units and operating rooms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The shortage of registered nurses in intensive care units is explained in part by the sharp decline in the number of younger registered nurses, whom intensive care units have historically attracted. Shortages in operating rooms probably reflect that many registered nurses who work in this setting are reaching the age when they are beginning to reduce their hours worked or are retiring altogether.</p><p>Major variations occur in the number of health care workers per capita population and in the skill mix employed across countries, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor ratio varies widely from one country to another, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor skill mix is important and may have consequences for the respective tasks of nurses and doctors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that these variations are taking place among countries with a relatively similar economic development level.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of physicians, nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists in selected countries. WHO data, 2000.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-2\"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Geographical imbalances</title><p>Virtually all countries suffer from a geographical maldistribution of human resources for health, and the primary area of concern is usually the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In both industrialized and developing countries, urban areas almost invariably have a substantially higher concentration of physicians than rural areas.</p><p>Understandably, most health care professionals prefer to settle in urban areas, which offer opportunities for professional development as well as education and other amenities for themselves and their families. But it is in the rural and remote areas, especially in the developing countries, that most severe public health problems are found.</p><p>The geographical maldistribution of doctors has been the object of particular attention. In general there is a higher concentration of general practitioners in the inner suburbs of the metropolitan areas. According to the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>], the reasons for high concentration of general practitioners in inner city areas are:</p><p>&#x02022; historical</p><p>&#x02022; lifestyle-related: access to amenities</p><p>&#x02022; spouse/husband-related: greater employment opportunities</p><p>&#x02022; child-related: better access to secondary and tertiary education services</p><p>&#x02022; professional, family and social ties and professional ambitions.</p><p>The geographical distribution of health care personnel is an important issue in many countries. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, contains one-fifth of the country's population but around half of the available health personnel [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>]. In Bangladesh, most of the doctors (35%) and nurses (30%) in health services are located in four metropolitan districts where only 14.5% of the population lives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B70\">70</xref>]. This concentration pattern is characteristic of developing countries.</p><p>In Indonesia the geographical distribution of physicians is a particular concern, since Indonesia's vast size and difficult geography present a tremendous challenge to health service delivery [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B71\">71</xref>]. It is difficult to place doctors in remote islands or mountain or forest locations with few amenities, no opportunities for private practice, and poor communications with the rest of the country.</p><p>To improve the geographical distribution of physicians, governments often have used combinations of compulsory service and incentives. So far, there is virtually no country in the world that has solved the problem of a rural/urban imbalance of the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. This does not necessarily mean that policies and programmes designed to reduce the imbalance have had no effect. For example, Thailand has successfully begun to stem the migration of health professionals from rural to urban areas and from public to private facilities with a range of strong financial incentives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B72\">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Institutional and services imbalances</title><p>Institutional imbalances occur when some health care facilities have too many staff because of prestige, working conditions, ability to generate additional income, or other situation-specific factors, while others are understaffed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B73\">73</xref>]. Institutions such as magnet hospitals, for example, are hospitals characterized by adequate to excellent staffing, low turnover, rich nursing skill mix and greater job satisfaction, among other factors, even in the face of a general health personnel shortage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B74\">74</xref>].</p><p>Imbalance between the types of health services provided may also arise. In particular, we can consider the issue of curative versus preventive care. In effect, it has been estimated that most diseases (80%) and accidents are preventable through known methodologies, yet at present there is an imbalance in the funding of medical research, with only 1%-2% going to prevention and 98%-99% spent on curative approaches [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B75\">75</xref>]. This imbalance in funding raises the question of a health workforce imbalance between preventive and curative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Gender imbalances</title><p>In many countries, women still tend to concentrate in the lower-status health occupations and to be a minority among more highly trained professionals and managers. In Bangladesh, the distribution by gender of the health workforce shows that the total proportion of women accounts for little more than one-fifth in health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>]. The distribution of women by occupational category is biased in favour of nurses. Women are very poorly represented in other categories, such as dentists, medical assistants, pharmacists, managers/trainers and doctors. The underrepresentation of women in managerial and decision-making positions may lead to less attention to and poorer understanding of the problems specific to women and the particularities of their utilization patterns [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B77\">77</xref>].</p><p>Female general practitioners have been shown to practise differently from males, managing different types of medical conditions, with some differences due to patient mix and patient selectivity, and others inherent in the sex of physician. In some more traditional areas, some women will not seek care for themselves or even for their children because they do not have access to a female provider [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This framework can be used to assess policy reforms and their impact on health workforce imbalances; it also provides a common framework for cross-country comparisons. This framework emphasizes the number and type of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, illustrating the complexity of this issue. From a policy perspective, it is particularly interesting to identify factors that policy-makers can influence in order to remedy imbalance problems.</p><p>Various monetary and non-monetary incentives are used to influence the supply and/or demand for the health workforce. For example, subsidies, grants and scholarships are examples of incentives that can be used to attract more nursing students, whereas wage increases, additional benefits and working hours flexibility are examples of commonly used incentives to attract or retain the health workforce.</p><p>The numerous factors and actors involved in the health workforce imbalance issue call for a coherent health workforce vision and policy. In that context, health planning plays an important role since it contributes to shaping the health care system. Moreover, since from a societal perspective market mechanisms alone do not allow an adequate demand/supply of health personnel to be reached, public interventions such as human resources planning are a means to correct for market failures. Health planning involves a time horizon. Forecasting the future number of health personnel needed and developing policies to meet such figures are common to any health care system. Physicians represent the profession for which more planning effort has been expended to achieve a workforce of appropriate size than for any other health profession. Countries' desire to meet population health needs and to avoid social welfare losses resulting from a shortage or an oversupply are factors explaining, to a large extent, the importance attributed to planning in the context of public health policies.</p><p>The policy implications of forecasting either a shortage or a surplus of health care personnel are different, and hence attempts at projections must be rigorous. For instance, referring to previous studies predicting significant surpluses, Cooper [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B78\">78</xref>] notes that such large surpluses have not occurred so far, because of a decrease in physician work effort. Factors such as age, sex and lifestyle contributed to this evolution.</p><p>As a result of forecasted physician surpluses, various policy recommendations have been formulated. The United States Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B79\">79</xref>] published a report recommending, among other things, that there be no new medical schools, that existing schools should not increase their class size and that the number of first-year residency positions should be reduced. The Pew Health Professions Commission Report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B80\">80</xref>] issued a report recommending more severe steps, such as the closing of some medical schools and tightening the visa process for international medical graduates.</p><p>This framework also apprehends the different types of imbalances. This is important since the choice of a policy will also depend on the type of imbalance. Significant disparities in human resources for health between health occupation, regions, gender or health services are recognized as classic problems of imbalance. However, the question of a public/private imbalance is more debatable. One the one hand, we can argue that for equity and access, a health care system should have a strong public component. On the other hand, we can imagine a private-sector oriented health care system with mechanisms to ensure access to the poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of imbalances in the health workforce, this paper has discussed a framework for human resources for health and proposed a typology of imbalances. Although the term \"imbalance\" is commonly used with respect to the health workforce, it is clear that imbalance in the health workforce encompasses a wide range of possible situations and is a complex issue. The use of a framework should facilitate the development of policy tools and their assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'

        "query": "How do vaccines work in the immune system?",
        "answer": "Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize and respond to specific pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, without causing the disease. The process typically involves introducing a harmless component of the pathogen, such as a piece of its genetic material, proteins, or inactivated forms of the pathogen, into the body. This exposure prompts the immune system to produce an immune response.\n\nFor instance, vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna utilize mRNA technology. These vaccines deliver messenger RNA (mRNA) that instructs cells to produce a harmless piece of the virus (specifically, the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus). Once the protein is produced, the immune system recognizes it as foreign and begins to generate an immune response. This includes the production of antibodies and the activation of T-cells, which are crucial for identifying and attacking infected cells.\n\nAfter vaccination, if the individual is later exposed to the actual pathogen, their immune system can quickly recognize it and mount a defense, often preventing illness or reducing the severity of the disease. This process is a key aspect of how vaccines contribute to immunity and help control the spread of infectious diseases. \n\nIn summary, vaccines prime the immune system by simulating an infection, allowing for a rapid and effective response to future exposures to the actual pathogen.",

It is a complex issue that encompasses a wide range of possible situations. This paper aims to contribute not only to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature, but also to the development of an analytical framework. The framework emphasizes the number and types of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, and facilitates the development of policy tools and their assessment. Moreover, to facilitate comparisons between health workforce imbalances, a typology of imbalances is proposed that differentiates between profession/specialty imbalances, geographical imbalances, institutional and services imbalances and gender imbalances.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Imbalance in the health workforce is a major challenge for health policy-makers, since human resources &#x02013; the different kinds of clinical and non-clinical staff who make each individual and public health intervention happen &#x02013; are the most important of the health system's inputs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. Imbalance is not a new issue, as nursing shortages were reported in hospitals in the United States of America as early as 1915 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. It remains a major concern to this day, reported in both developed and developing countries and for most of the health care professions.</p><p>Although imbalance in the health workforce is an important issue for policy-makers, various elements contribute to obscuring policy development. First, many reports of shortages are not borne out by the evidence. Rosenfeld and Moses [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] show that an overwhelming majority of newspapers, journals and newsletter articles describing the nursing situation in the United States presume the existence of a shortage. They found that even in those areas where concrete evidence of a shortage was not available, the term \"nursing shortage\" still appeared. Second, the notion of shortage is a relative one: what is considered a nursing shortage in Europe would probably be viewed differently from an African perspective. Finally, imbalances are of different types and their impact on the health care system varies. In consequence, there is a general need to critically review the imbalance issue.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature and the development of an analytical framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition</title><p>There are various approaches to defining imbalances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. From an economic perspective, a skill imbalance (shortage/surplus) occurs when the quantity of a given skill supplied by the workforce and the quantity demanded by employers diverge at the existing market conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Labour market supplies and demands for occupational skills fluctuate continuously, so at times there will be imbalances in the labour market. In other words, a shortage/surplus is the result of a disequilibrium between the demand and supply for labour. In contrast, non-economic definitions are usually normative, i.e. there is a shortage of labour relative to defined norms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. In the case of health personnel, these definitions are based either on a value judgement &#x02013; for instance, how much care people should receive &#x02013; or on a professional determination &#x02013; such as deciding what is the appropriate number of physicians for the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature</title><p>One of the key questions regarding imbalances is how long these last: Is the imbalance temporary or permanent? In a competitive labour market, we should expect most imbalances to be resolved over time. Imbalances will tend to disappear faster the greater the reaction speed and also the greater the elasticity of supply (or demand) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. This type of imbalance (shortage or surplus) is defined as dynamic.</p><p>In contrast, a static imbalance occurs because supply does not increase or decrease; market equilibrium is therefore not achieved. For instance, wage adjustments may respond slowly to shifts in demand or supply as a result of institutional and regulatory arrangements, imperfect market competition (monopoly, monopsony) and wage-control policies. Another example is physicians' education: because of the length of time required to educate physicians, changes in available supply take a long time to react significantly. Lack of information on the state of the various labour markets can also be a factor in the speed of market adjustment. To make proper labour market decisions, households and firms must be informed of the existing market conditions across markets. They must therefore know what wages are paid and the nature and location of job openings and available workers.</p><p>Moreover, we should also differentiate between qualitative and quantitative imbalance. In a tight labour market, employers might not find the ideal candidate, but will still recruit someone. Under these conditions, the issue is the quality of job candidates rather than the quantity of people willing and able to do the job [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. From the employers' perspective, a shortage of workers exists; from the job-market perspective, the existence of a shortage could be questioned because the jobs are filled. One negative hidden impact of a qualitative shortage is the number of positions that are filled with ineffective individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A conceptual framework</title><p>To better understand the role of factors affecting health workforce imbalances and to facilitate the development of policy tools, a conceptual framework is presented in this section.</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Factors affecting health workforce imbalances are numerous and complex, but focusing on crucial elements should permit insight into the issue of health workforce imbalances. The framework is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> and contains six main components: the demand for health labour, the supply of health labour, the health care system, policies, resources and \"global\" factors.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Framework for imbalance of human resources for health</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-1\"/></fig><p>Central to this framework are the demand for and supply of health labour. Also included in the framework is the health care system, and in particular, some of its features that are likely to have an impact on health workforce imbalances. Policies constitute another crucial element of the framework. In effect, health policies but also non-health-oriented policies can have an impact on health workforce imbalances. The framework also incorporates financial, physical and knowledge resources that contribute to model the health workforce.Finally, \"global\" factors such as economic, sociodemographic, political, geographical and cultural factors are included. These elements contribute directly or indirectly to shaping and transforming the entire society and hence the health workforce.</p></sec><sec><title>The demand for health personnel</title><p>The first element of the framework to be examined is the demand for health personnel. The demand for health personnel can be considered as a derived demand for health services. Accordingly, we should consider factors determining the demand for health services. Personal characteristics &#x02013; such as health needs, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics &#x02013; and economic factors play an important role.</p><p>It has often been proposed that the planning of human resources for health be based solely on estimates of health needs in the population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. However, relying only on the concept of need is difficult, because it can be defined either broadly or restrictedly and accordingly lead to a perception of either systematic shortage or surplus. Health needs is only one of the factors affecting the demand for health personnel.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of economic factors on the demand for health care. In particular in the United States, studies have attempted to estimate price and income elasticities of demand for medical services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. Measurements of price or income elasticities make it possible to evaluate the impact of a change in price or income on the demand for health care. Most studies reported elasticities in the range between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating that consumers tend to be responsive to price changes but that the degree of price sensitivity is not very large compared to that for many other goods and services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>Another element influencing the demand for health care is the value of a patient's time, such as travel time and waiting time. Acton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] found that in the United States, elasticity of demand with respect to travel time ranged between -0.6 and -1, meaning that a 10% increase in travel time would induce a reduction of 6%-10% in the demand for health care.</p><p>Other factors affect the demand for health labour. In particular, some specific features of the health care system and its features, policies, resources and environmental factors do have an impact on the demand for health labour. Their respective role will further discussed later.</p></sec><sec><title>The supply of human resources for health</title><p>After reviewing factors affecting the demand for health labour, we shall now turn to those affecting the supply of the health workforce. In particular, we shall consider the following elements: factors affecting the choice for a health professional training/education, participation in the health labour market and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Education/professional training choice</title><p>The availability of a renewed health workforce, as well as the type of profession and specialty chosen by individuals, is a major concern for health decision-makers. These issues are of particular relevance, especially since the number of younger people, predominantly women, choosing a nursing career is declining in some countries and since in professional training/education, individuals' choices do not always match the absorptive capacity of the market.</p><p>From an economic perspective, the decision to undertake professional training/education is considered an investment decision. To emphasize the essential similarities of these investments to other kinds of investments, economists refer to them as investment in human capital [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. Since investment decisions usually deliver payoffs over time, we must consider the entire stream of costs and benefits. The expected returns on human capital investments are a higher level of earnings, greater job satisfaction over one's lifetime and a greater appreciation of non-market activities and interests.</p><p>Based on the human capital approach, rate of return on education can be estimated. An average rate of return that is high and rising for a given profession will attract more individuals to that profession. On the other hand, a lower and decreasing average rate of return will discourage individuals from choosing that profession. Nowak and Preston [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], using the human capital approach, found that Australian nurses are poorly paid in comparison to other female professionals. The declining interest in nursing can be partly explained by the expansion of career opportunities in traditionally male-dominated occupations over the last three decades that entail a higher rate of return [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The number of young women entering the registered-nurse workforce has declined because many women who would have entered nursing in the past &#x02013; particularly those with high academic ability &#x02013; are now entering managerial and professional occupations that used to be traditionally male.</p><p>Besides the human capital approach, the choice of a profession can also be explained by sociopsychological factors. For instance, individuals may choose a profession because it is highly valued by the society or for family tradition. In the health sector, the satisfaction afforded by caring for people and assisting them to improve their health is an important element used by nursing schools to attract new enrollees. In the light of this approach, the decline in the number of individuals choosing nursing as a career might also be explained by the fact that this profession is now less socially valued than before [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participation in the labour market</title><p>The economic theory of the decision to work views the decision as a choice concerning how people spend their time. Individuals face a trade-off between labour and leisure. They decide how much of their time to spend working for pay or participating in leisure activities, the latter being activities that are not work-related.</p><p>An issue that has drawn a lot of attention recently is the impact of wage increases on labour participation, in particular for nurses. In the short term, higher wages can have at least two effects on the labour supply of current qualified nurses: first, qualified nurses who are working in other occupations may return to nursing activities; second, nurses now in practice may respond by working more hours. In the long run, higher wages in nursing relative to other occupations make nursing an attractive profession and will draw more people into nurse training programmes.</p><p>In their literature review of wage elasticity of nursing labour supply, Antonazzo et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] and Chiha and Link [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] found that most of the studies indicate a positive relationship, although not a strong one, between wages and labour supply. Accordingly, increases in nursing wages are unlikely to cause significant increases in labour participation. A literature review on the women's workforce undertaken by Killingsworth and Heckman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] indicated that in addition to wage rate, women's participation is responsive to changes in unearned income, spouse's wage and having children (particularly of pre-school age). Another aspect of labour supply decisions that has been investigated by Philips [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] is the costs associated with entering the nursing labour market (such as costs of child care and housework). The elasticity of participation with respect to changes in working costs was evaluated at -0.67 for all nurses. This suggests that a subsidy leading to a decrease of 10% in these costs would increase the participation of nurses by 6.7%.</p><p>Moreover, hospitals are also using a variety of strategies to recruit new staff. A survey of hospitals in the United States shows that richer benefits, such as health insurance and vacation time, are the most common incentives used. In addition, hospitals may offer other recruitment and retention benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, flexible hours and signing bonuses based on experience or length of commitment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. Many countries, but particularly developed ones, use such incentives to recruit new staff.</p><p>Economic factors also play a role in physician's participation in the labour market, as demonstrated by the impact of cost-containment policies in Canada, where most provincial governments have implemented an assortment of controls of health care expenses. Threshold reductions were introduced, so that fees payable to individual physicians were reduced as billing exceeded an agreed threshold. As a consequence, physicians who had billed at the threshold level chose to take leaves of absence rather than receive a level of reimbursement they considered inadequate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>].</p><p>When health personnel choose an alternative or additional occupation, this is likely to have consequences on health labour supply. In developing countries, and particularly in Africa, attempts to reform the health care sector have frequently failed to respond to the aspirations of staff concerning remuneration and working conditions. Salaries are often inadequate and may be paid late, and health workers try to solve their financial problems in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Private practice is only one of the many survival strategies that health personnel use to supplement their income and increase their job satisfaction. Teaching, attending training courses, supervision activities, research, trade and agriculture are some of these alternative strategies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Labour market exit</title><p>Parker and Rickam [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] examined the economic determinants of the labour force withdrawal of registered nurses in the United States, i.e. nurses leaving the profession to pursue a non-nursing occupation and employed nurses withdrawing from the labour force. Their results suggest that a significant number of registered nurses withdraw, at least temporarily, from the labour force. Among the significant elements influencing the withdrawal decision are the wage rate, other family income, presence of children and full-time/part-time work status. Increasing registered nurses' wages and working full-time is expected to reduce the probability of labour force withdrawal, whereas higher education levels, age and other family income increase the probability of labour force withdrawal.</p><p>The relative importance of wage is also emphasized by studies investigating job satisfaction. There is support in the empirical literature for the existence of job dissatisfaction among nurses, and the link between job dissatisfaction and job exit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]. In the United States the most important factors in nurses' resignation were, in order of importance: workload, staffing, time with patients, flexible scheduling, respect from nursing administration, increasing nursing knowledge, promotion opportunities, work stimulation, salary and decision-making. These studies suggest that salary is just one of the reasons why nurses are quitting. The relative importance of wage is confirmed by Shields and Ward [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]. Their results suggest that dissatisfaction with promotion and training opportunities has a stronger impact than workload or pay.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration</title><p>Migration of health personnel can have a serious impact on the supply of human resources in health, because it may exacerbate health personnel imbalances in \"sending\" countries. It is suggested that migration is an \"individual, spontaneous and voluntary act\" that is motivated by the perceived net gain of migrating &#x02013; that is, the gain will offset the tangible and intangible costs of moving [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Decisions to migrate are often a family strategy to produce a better income and improve survival chances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>The reality for many health workers in developing countries is to be underpaid, poorly motivated and increasingly dissatisfied and sceptical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. The relevance of motivation to migration is self-evident. There can be little doubt that for many health workers an improvement in pay and conditions will act as an incentive to stay in the country. Improved pensions, child care, educational opportunities and recognition are also known to be important [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. In Ghana it is estimated that only 191 of the 489 doctors who graduated between 1985 and 1994 were still working in the country in 1997 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Health system characteristics</title><p>As the health workforce is part of the health care system, we shall also consider features of the health care system that are likely to have an impact on the demand and supply of health labour. In particular, we shall examine market failures, the diversity of stakeholders, the supply-demand adjustment time lag and hospitals' potential monopsony power.</p></sec><sec><title>Market failures</title><p>From an economic perspective, the health care market is characterized by market failures &#x02013; that is, the assumptions for perfect competition are violated. From a societal perspective, in the presence of market failures such as externalities &#x02013; imperfect knowledge, asymmetry of information and uncertainty &#x02013; market mechanisms lead to a non-optimal demand and/or supply in health services. In other words, shortages and surpluses are likely to result from the health care market.</p><p>Most markets are characterized by market failures, but what is unique to the health services market is the extent of these market failures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Governments try to correct health care market failures through policy interventions. A classic example of public intervention in the presence of a positive externality is the introduction of a policy of mandatory vaccination. However, implementing such policies is sometimes difficult and may result in only partial correction of the market failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Stakeholders</title><p>The health care system is characterized by a wide range of institutional stakeholders involved in shaping human resources for health, all of whom may have different objectives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. The objectives of a union or professional association do not necessarily coincide, for example, with those of a government ministry, a hospital manager or the central government. Unions/professional associations seek to increase their members' market power, employment and income [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], whereas the ministry of finance will want more budget equilibrium and will favour measures to limit health care expenditures.</p><p>In the case of Mozambique, whereas the policy of employing national professionals by cooperation agencies has met with warm support from national cadres, its effect on the health sector is problematic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. The prospect of immediate financial gains puts pressure on qualified professionals to leave their posts within the Mozambique National Health Service to take up management or consultant positions. The substantial investment in their training is therefore producing dubious direct returns to the National Health Service. More seriously perhaps, the presence of donor-paid jobs outside the health sector (as programme coordinators, researchers, etc.) is creating pressure on the Ministry of Health itself, exacerbating the imbalances in the National Health Service and creating incentives for trained Mozambicans to leave the public sector.</p></sec><sec><title>Time lag</title><p>Moreover, adjustments between the demand and supply for health personnel may take a long time. In the health care field; the time lag between education and practising may be quite substantial. To obtain licensure to practise medicine requires lengthy education and training, and the long lag time between a changed student intake and a change in supply has been noted [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]: supply adjustment for physicians is not immediate, but takes a long time.</p></sec><sec><title>Hospitals' potential monopsony power</title><p>A single entity that is the sole purchaser of labour is a <italic>monopsony</italic>. One example is the potential monopsony power of hospitals in hiring nurses or the ministry of health in hiring the health workforce. The amount of labour demanded will influence the price the monopsonist must pay for it. In contrast to the situation in a competitive market, the monopsony is a price maker, not a price taker. Monopsony results in lower wages and lower employment of nurses compared to a competitive market.</p><p>A number of studies have tested whether or not hospitals possess monopsony power with respect to nurses, and the results are contradictory. Sullivan [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>] and Staiger et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>] concluded that hospitals have a substantial degree of monopsony power. In contrast, Hirsch and Schumacher [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>] did not find empirical support for the monopsony model. Nurses' wages were found not to be related to hospital density and to decrease rather than increase with respect to labour market size.</p></sec><sec><title>Provider power/monopoly</title><p>In contrast, providers' power may enable the latter to restrict the supply of human resources for health. Seldon, Jung and Cavazos [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such avenues as restricting supply and price-fixing. In France, trade unions are granted an institutional role at establishment level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. In India and Sri Lanka, a clear constraint to support-services contracting was the inability to counter the power of the public service unions in dictating employment terms and conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. The varying degree of homogeneity of the different professional groups may also explain their relative success in maintaining a monopoly of practice. In Iceland, one of the factors that contributed to breaking the professional monopoly of pharmacists was division within the profession [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Regulations</title><p>The type off regulation associated with a profession plays an important role regarding the supply of members of a profession. Regulation has, by tradition, been achieved through a combination of direct government regulation and, to a large extent, through rules adopted by professional associations, whose self-regulatory powers enable them to establish both entry requirements and rules regarding professional conduct [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>].</p><p>Such barriers to entry exist in particular for doctors, but also in other health professions, such as dentistry. Some argue that these barriers constitute a means to limit entry into the profession, and hence maintain high incomes. Muzondo and Pazderka [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] established, for Canadian professional licensing restrictions, a relationship between different variables of self-regulation and higher income. Seldon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such sources as restricting supply and price-fixing. However, the proponents of self-regulation claim that these barriers are a means to provide health care of quality and to protect patients from incompetent providers. In contrast, although most countries have a professional nursing association, nurses tend to have limited power to regulate entry to the profession. This could be associated with a large diversity of specialist groups in nursing failing to unite on issues related to professional regulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Health and non-health policies</title><p>Health and non-health policies contribute to shaping the health care system and have an influence on the demand and supply of health labour.</p><p>Health policy can be defined as a formal statement or procedure within institutions (notably government) that defines priorities and the parameters for action in response to health needs, available resources and other political pressures. Health policy is often enacted through legislation or other forms of rule-making that create regulations and incentives for providing health services and programmes and access to them. For instance, the decision to introduce or expand health insurance coverage is likely to have an impact on the demand for health services. This is illustrated by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, a controlled experiment that increased knowledge about the effect of different insurance copayments on use of medical services. Insurance copayments ranged from zero to 95%. The RAND study concluded that as the co-insurance rose, overall use and expenditure fell for adults and children combined [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>].</p><p>Non-health policies reflect state interventions in areas such as employment, education and regional development that contribute to shaping the health workforce. These policies do not directly address health issues, but have an indirect impact on such issues. In France, a controversial new regulation was introduced that reduced the workweek to a maximum of 35 hours in an attempt both to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and to achieve greater flexibility in the labour force. Unions responded by demanding the creation of more posts in public hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial, physical and knowledge resources</title><p>Financial, physical and knowledge resources are crucial to any type of health care workforce. The level of resources attributed to the health care system, and how these resources are used, will have a significant impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>In terms of financial resources, human resources account for a high proportion of national budgets assigned to the health sector [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Health expenditure claims an increasingly important share of the gross domestic product and, in most countries, wage costs (salaries, bonuses and other payments) are estimated to account for between 65% and 80% of the renewable health system expenditure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>].</p><p>Physical resources include human resources within the health sector and other sectors; buildings and engineering services such as sanitation, water and heating systems for community use and for the use of medical care institutions; and equipment and supplies. Finally, the health workforce is also constrained by its human capital. This human capital can be associated with the qualification and education of the health workforce. Education of the health workforce is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given in preparation for work.</p></sec><sec><title>Global factors</title><p>Economic, sociodemographic, cultural, and geographical factors contribute to shaping and transforming society and hence have a direct or indirect impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>From an economic perspective, for instance, there is evidence of a correlation between the level of economic development of a country and its level of human resources for health. Countries with higher GDP per capita are said to spend more on health care than countries with lower income, as demonstrated by cross-sectional studies, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>] and hence would also tend to have larger health workforces.</p><p>Moreover, both the demand and supply are likely to be affected by sociodemographic elements such as the age distribution of the population. On the demand side, the ageing of the population is giving rise to an increase in the demand for health services and health personnel, especially nurses for home care.</p><p>On the supply side, the ageing of the health workforce, and in particular of nurses, has serious implications for the future of the nursing labour market. For example, the Institute of Medicine noted that older registered nurses have a reduced capacity to perform certain tasks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. It was found that between 1983 and 1998 the average age of practising registered nurses increased by more than four years, from 37.4 to 41.9 years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. In contrast, the average age of the United States workforce as a whole increased by less than two years during the same period. Furthermore, the proportion of the registered-nurse workforce younger than 30 years decreased from 30.3% to 12.1% during this period.</p><p>Geographical and cultural factors also play a role in determining the demand and supply of human resources. Geographical characteristics affect the organization of health services delivery. For instance, a country with many islands or with isolated population groups will face particular challenges in terms of health workforce issues. Similarly, significant climatic changes are likely to give rise to changes in health needs, which in turn will call for changes in health services and in the health workforce. Finally, both cultural and political values also affect the demand for and supply of human resources for health.</p></sec><sec><title>Health workforce imbalances: a typology</title><p>This section considers a typology of imbalances, and differentiates between the following:</p><p>&#x02022; Profession/specialty imbalances: Under this category, we consider imbalance in the various health professions, such as doctors or nurses, as well as shortages within a profession, e.g. shortage of one type of specialists.</p><p>&#x02022; Geographical imbalances: These are disparities between urban and rural regions and poor and rich regions.</p><p>&#x02022; Institutional and services imbalances: These are differences in health workforce supply between health care facilities, as well as between services.</p><p>&#x02022; Gender imbalances: These are disparities in female/male representation in the health workforce.</p><sec><title>Profession/specialty imbalances</title><p>Imbalances have been reported for almost all health professions, and in particular for nurses. The United States General Accounting Office [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>] reports a nursing shortage. However, the nursing shortage has not been institution-wide but is concentrated in specialty care areas, particularly intensive care units and operating rooms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The shortage of registered nurses in intensive care units is explained in part by the sharp decline in the number of younger registered nurses, whom intensive care units have historically attracted. Shortages in operating rooms probably reflect that many registered nurses who work in this setting are reaching the age when they are beginning to reduce their hours worked or are retiring altogether.</p><p>Major variations occur in the number of health care workers per capita population and in the skill mix employed across countries, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor ratio varies widely from one country to another, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor skill mix is important and may have consequences for the respective tasks of nurses and doctors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that these variations are taking place among countries with a relatively similar economic development level.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of physicians, nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists in selected countries. WHO data, 2000.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-2\"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Geographical imbalances</title><p>Virtually all countries suffer from a geographical maldistribution of human resources for health, and the primary area of concern is usually the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In both industrialized and developing countries, urban areas almost invariably have a substantially higher concentration of physicians than rural areas.</p><p>Understandably, most health care professionals prefer to settle in urban areas, which offer opportunities for professional development as well as education and other amenities for themselves and their families. But it is in the rural and remote areas, especially in the developing countries, that most severe public health problems are found.</p><p>The geographical maldistribution of doctors has been the object of particular attention. In general there is a higher concentration of general practitioners in the inner suburbs of the metropolitan areas. According to the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>], the reasons for high concentration of general practitioners in inner city areas are:</p><p>&#x02022; historical</p><p>&#x02022; lifestyle-related: access to amenities</p><p>&#x02022; spouse/husband-related: greater employment opportunities</p><p>&#x02022; child-related: better access to secondary and tertiary education services</p><p>&#x02022; professional, family and social ties and professional ambitions.</p><p>The geographical distribution of health care personnel is an important issue in many countries. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, contains one-fifth of the country's population but around half of the available health personnel [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>]. In Bangladesh, most of the doctors (35%) and nurses (30%) in health services are located in four metropolitan districts where only 14.5% of the population lives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B70\">70</xref>]. This concentration pattern is characteristic of developing countries.</p><p>In Indonesia the geographical distribution of physicians is a particular concern, since Indonesia's vast size and difficult geography present a tremendous challenge to health service delivery [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B71\">71</xref>]. It is difficult to place doctors in remote islands or mountain or forest locations with few amenities, no opportunities for private practice, and poor communications with the rest of the country.</p><p>To improve the geographical distribution of physicians, governments often have used combinations of compulsory service and incentives. So far, there is virtually no country in the world that has solved the problem of a rural/urban imbalance of the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. This does not necessarily mean that policies and programmes designed to reduce the imbalance have had no effect. For example, Thailand has successfully begun to stem the migration of health professionals from rural to urban areas and from public to private facilities with a range of strong financial incentives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B72\">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Institutional and services imbalances</title><p>Institutional imbalances occur when some health care facilities have too many staff because of prestige, working conditions, ability to generate additional income, or other situation-specific factors, while others are understaffed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B73\">73</xref>]. Institutions such as magnet hospitals, for example, are hospitals characterized by adequate to excellent staffing, low turnover, rich nursing skill mix and greater job satisfaction, among other factors, even in the face of a general health personnel shortage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B74\">74</xref>].</p><p>Imbalance between the types of health services provided may also arise. In particular, we can consider the issue of curative versus preventive care. In effect, it has been estimated that most diseases (80%) and accidents are preventable through known methodologies, yet at present there is an imbalance in the funding of medical research, with only 1%-2% going to prevention and 98%-99% spent on curative approaches [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B75\">75</xref>]. This imbalance in funding raises the question of a health workforce imbalance between preventive and curative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Gender imbalances</title><p>In many countries, women still tend to concentrate in the lower-status health occupations and to be a minority among more highly trained professionals and managers. In Bangladesh, the distribution by gender of the health workforce shows that the total proportion of women accounts for little more than one-fifth in health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>]. The distribution of women by occupational category is biased in favour of nurses. Women are very poorly represented in other categories, such as dentists, medical assistants, pharmacists, managers/trainers and doctors. The underrepresentation of women in managerial and decision-making positions may lead to less attention to and poorer understanding of the problems specific to women and the particularities of their utilization patterns [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B77\">77</xref>].</p><p>Female general practitioners have been shown to practise differently from males, managing different types of medical conditions, with some differences due to patient mix and patient selectivity, and others inherent in the sex of physician. In some more traditional areas, some women will not seek care for themselves or even for their children because they do not have access to a female provider [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This framework can be used to assess policy reforms and their impact on health workforce imbalances; it also provides a common framework for cross-country comparisons. This framework emphasizes the number and type of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, illustrating the complexity of this issue. From a policy perspective, it is particularly interesting to identify factors that policy-makers can influence in order to remedy imbalance problems.</p><p>Various monetary and non-monetary incentives are used to influence the supply and/or demand for the health workforce. For example, subsidies, grants and scholarships are examples of incentives that can be used to attract more nursing students, whereas wage increases, additional benefits and working hours flexibility are examples of commonly used incentives to attract or retain the health workforce.</p><p>The numerous factors and actors involved in the health workforce imbalance issue call for a coherent health workforce vision and policy. In that context, health planning plays an important role since it contributes to shaping the health care system. Moreover, since from a societal perspective market mechanisms alone do not allow an adequate demand/supply of health personnel to be reached, public interventions such as human resources planning are a means to correct for market failures. Health planning involves a time horizon. Forecasting the future number of health personnel needed and developing policies to meet such figures are common to any health care system. Physicians represent the profession for which more planning effort has been expended to achieve a workforce of appropriate size than for any other health profession. Countries' desire to meet population health needs and to avoid social welfare losses resulting from a shortage or an oversupply are factors explaining, to a large extent, the importance attributed to planning in the context of public health policies.</p><p>The policy implications of forecasting either a shortage or a surplus of health care personnel are different, and hence attempts at projections must be rigorous. For instance, referring to previous studies predicting significant surpluses, Cooper [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B78\">78</xref>] notes that such large surpluses have not occurred so far, because of a decrease in physician work effort. Factors such as age, sex and lifestyle contributed to this evolution.</p><p>As a result of forecasted physician surpluses, various policy recommendations have been formulated. The United States Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B79\">79</xref>] published a report recommending, among other things, that there be no new medical schools, that existing schools should not increase their class size and that the number of first-year residency positions should be reduced. The Pew Health Professions Commission Report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B80\">80</xref>] issued a report recommending more severe steps, such as the closing of some medical schools and tightening the visa process for international medical graduates.</p><p>This framework also apprehends the different types of imbalances. This is important since the choice of a policy will also depend on the type of imbalance. Significant disparities in human resources for health between health occupation, regions, gender or health services are recognized as classic problems of imbalance. However, the question of a public/private imbalance is more debatable. One the one hand, we can argue that for equity and access, a health care system should have a strong public component. On the other hand, we can imagine a private-sector oriented health care system with mechanisms to ensure access to the poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of imbalances in the health workforce, this paper has discussed a framework for human resources for health and proposed a typology of imbalances. Although the term \"imbalance\" is commonly used with respect to the health workforce, it is clear that imbalance in the health workforce encompasses a wide range of possible situations and is a complex issue. The use of a framework should facilitate the development of policy tools and their assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'

Pro and Raz are bisdioxopiperazine compounds. In this work, we evaluated the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of Pro and Raz <italic>in vivo </italic>against two lung tumor models, one of murine origin (Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC) and one of human origin (LAX-83).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After determining the lethal dosage of Pro and Raz, we assessed and compared the inhibitory effects of Pro and Raz against primary tumor growth and metastatic occurrences of LLC at the dosage of LD<sub>5</sub>. Pro and Raz were active against primary tumor growth and significantly inhibited pulmonary metastasis of LLC at same dose-ranges (inhibitory rates &#x0003e; 90 %). Both Raz and Pro were effective in 1, 5, and 9 day administration schedules. Three different schedules of Raz and Pro were effective against the primary tumor growth of LLC (35&#x02013;50 %). The synergistic anticancer effect of Raz with bleomycin (Ble) (from 41.3 % to 73.3 %) was more obvious than those with daunorubicin (Dau) (from 33.1 % to 56.3 %) in the LLC tumor model. Pro was also seen to have synergistic anti-cancer effects with Ble in the LLC model. Both Raz and Pro inhibited the growth of LAX 83 in a statistically significant manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data suggest that both Raz and Pro may have anti-tumor potentiality and Raz and Pro have combinative effects with Ble or Dau. The potential targets of bisdioxopiperazines may include lung cancers, especially on tumor metastasis. The anti-cancer effects of Raz and Pro can be increased with the help of other anticancer drugs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Razoxane (ICRF-159) (<italic>Raz</italic>), first developed in UK, was the earliest agent against spontaneous metastasis for the murine model (Lewis lung carcinoma) in 1969 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. A large volume of papers and projects have been published in the utilities and mechanisms of <italic>Raz </italic>for anticancer actions, like assisting radiotherapy, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>] overcoming multi-drug resistance (MDR) of daunorubicin and doxorubicin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], inhibiting topoisomerase II [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>] and so on. More importantly, <italic>Raz</italic>, as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines, has been licensed in 28 countries in 4 continents. Since morpholine groups in some structures were reported to be responsible for cytotoxic or modulative actions on tumors, an anticancer agent, probimane [1,2-bis (N<sup>4</sup>-morpholine-3, 5-dioxopeprazine-1-yl) propane; AT-2153, Pro] was synthesized by introducing two morpholine groups into <italic>Raz </italic>in China.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. <italic>Raz </italic>and <italic>Pro </italic>belong to <italic>bisdiopiperazines</italic>. Like <italic>Raz</italic>, <italic>Pro </italic>also exhibits anti-tumor activity both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>against experimental tumor models in a small scale investigation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>] and limited clinical data showed that <italic>Pro </italic>could inhibit human malignant lymphoma even for those resistant to other anticancer drugs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. Pro exhibits the same pharmacological effects as <italic>Raz</italic>, like detoxication of <italic>Adriamycin </italic>(<italic>ADR</italic>) induced cardiotoxicities, and synergism with <italic>ADR </italic>against tumors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. We have found some novel biological effects of <italic>Pro</italic>, like inhibiting the activity of calmodulin (<italic>CaM</italic>), a cell-signal regulator, which can explain anticancer actions and the combined cytotoxic effect of <italic>Pro </italic>and <italic>ADR </italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>]. Pro was also shown to inhibit lipoperoxidation (<italic>LPO</italic>) of erythrocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], influence tumor sialic acid synthesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>] and inhibit the binding of fibrinogen to leukemia cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>Lung cancer is the No 1 killer among all categories of cancers in urban areas in China and many Western countries. The high mortality rate of lung cancer can easily be caused by inducing multi-drug resistance (<italic>MDR</italic>) and by high metastatic occurrence in clinics [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. Since we assume that <italic>Pro</italic>, like <italic>Raz </italic>may possess useful therapeutic potentialities, we evaluated <italic>in vivo </italic>the chemotherapeutical parameters of <italic>Pro </italic>and <italic>Raz </italic>for lung cancer of both murine and human origins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Lethal toxicity of Pro and Raz in mice</title><p>The lethal dosage of <italic>Pro </italic>and <italic>Raz </italic>is tabulated in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>.

The present explanation for the anticancer mechanisms of <italic>Raz </italic>has been attributed to antiangiogenesis and topoisomerase II inhibition.[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] Since the antimetastatic activities of <italic>Raz </italic>and <italic>Pro </italic>were much stronger than those actions against primary tumor growth, this special targeting on metastasis ought to be more useful in clinical cancer treatment. <italic>Raz </italic>and <italic>Pro </italic>show typical characteristics of antiangiogenesis agents, which target small nodule of tumors. Meanwhile, recent reports on drugs targeting <italic>angiogenesis </italic>indicate that most anti-vascular drugs have low or even no effects on most cancers when they are used alone in clinics, but they show synergistic effects in combination with other anticancer drugs. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>] Our study shows synergistic anticancer actions of <italic>Raz </italic>and <italic>Pro </italic>with <italic>Ble </italic>or <italic>Dau </italic>basing on this theory. Previous work showed that <italic>Pro </italic>and <italic>Raz </italic>could reduce the cardiotoxicity of <italic>anthrocycline</italic>,[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>] so we may reasonably deduce that they can also reduce the cytotoxicity of <italic>anthrocyclines</italic>. The data in our study suggests that the synergistic effects of <italic>Raz </italic>with <italic>anthrocyclines </italic>are present, but not as potent as those with <italic>Ble</italic>.</p><p>Since we have tested the antitumor activity of clinically available anticancer drugs (CTX, 5-Fu, MTX, DDP and VCR) against LAX-83, CTX being the best one, two bisdioxopiperazines studied on this work show overall similar anticancer effective as commonly used drugs. Although the anticancer effects of CTX and VCR are better than those of Pro, for other commonly used drugs, such as DDP, MTX and 5-Fu, the antitumor effects are no better than those of Pro. Since the antitumor effects of MTX and DDP are even less effective than those of <italic>Pro </italic>and <italic>Raz</italic>, we suggest that anticancer effects of <italic>Pro </italic>and <italic>Raz </italic>are within the effective anticancer ranges of commonly available anticancer drugs.</p><p>The other useful property of <italic>Pro </italic>is that it is the most water-soluble among the <italic>bisdioxopiperazines</italic>. Most <italic>bisdioxopiperazines </italic>are less water-soluble and given orally in clinics. Although oral administration is easy for patients, bioavailability varies from patient to patient. For some patients who have a poor absorption of <italic>bisdioxopiperazines </italic>in oral administration, <italic>Pro </italic>can be injected <italic>iv </italic>to maintain stable drug levels. Our previous work showed that <italic>Pro </italic>could strongly accumulate in tumor tissue while <italic>Pro </italic>levels in other tissues decrease rapidly [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Presently, a stereo-isomer of <italic>Raz</italic>, (dexrazoxane, <italic>ICRF-187</italic>), a water-soluble Raz, is being reinvestigated and has aroused the interests of clinical oncologists. Phase III clinical studies are currently underway in the US. More importantly, <italic>ICRF-187 </italic>was licensed in 28 countries in 4 continents. This work shows a noticeable inhibition of <italic>Pro </italic>and <italic>Raz </italic>on lung cancers and suggests possible usage of <italic>Raz </italic>and <italic>Pro </italic>on lung cancer in clinics.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The advantages of <italic>bisdioxopiperazines </italic>in clinical treatment of lung cancers are as follows: (i) <italic>Pro </italic>and <italic>Raz </italic>can inhibit the growth of lung cancers, with and without the help of other anticancer drugs, like <italic>Dau </italic>and <italic>Ble</italic>; (ii) like <italic>Raz</italic>, <italic>Pro </italic>strongly inhibits spontaneous pulmonary metastasis of <italic>LLC</italic>; (iii) since <italic>Pro </italic>can inhibit <italic>CaM </italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>], a calcium activated protein that's associated with <italic>MDR </italic>and metastatic phenotypes, synergistic anticancer effects of <italic>Pro </italic>and <italic>Raz </italic>can be expected in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, like <italic>Dau </italic>or <italic>Ble</italic>. Now, new concepts of the relationship between tumor metastasis and <italic>MDR </italic>in cancers have been stated,[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] whereas <italic>bisdioxopiperazines </italic>can inhibit both tumor metastasis and <italic>MDR</italic>.

It is a complex issue that encompasses a wide range of possible situations. This paper aims to contribute not only to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature, but also to the development of an analytical framework. The framework emphasizes the number and types of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, and facilitates the development of policy tools and their assessment. Moreover, to facilitate comparisons between health workforce imbalances, a typology of imbalances is proposed that differentiates between profession/specialty imbalances, geographical imbalances, institutional and services imbalances and gender imbalances.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Imbalance in the health workforce is a major challenge for health policy-makers, since human resources &#x02013; the different kinds of clinical and non-clinical staff who make each individual and public health intervention happen &#x02013; are the most important of the health system's inputs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. Imbalance is not a new issue, as nursing shortages were reported in hospitals in the United States of America as early as 1915 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. It remains a major concern to this day, reported in both developed and developing countries and for most of the health care professions.</p><p>Although imbalance in the health workforce is an important issue for policy-makers, various elements contribute to obscuring policy development. First, many reports of shortages are not borne out by the evidence. Rosenfeld and Moses [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] show that an overwhelming majority of newspapers, journals and newsletter articles describing the nursing situation in the United States presume the existence of a shortage. They found that even in those areas where concrete evidence of a shortage was not available, the term \"nursing shortage\" still appeared. Second, the notion of shortage is a relative one: what is considered a nursing shortage in Europe would probably be viewed differently from an African perspective. Finally, imbalances are of different types and their impact on the health care system varies. In consequence, there is a general need to critically review the imbalance issue.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the issues related to imbalance through a critical review of its definition and nature and the development of an analytical framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition</title><p>There are various approaches to defining imbalances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. From an economic perspective, a skill imbalance (shortage/surplus) occurs when the quantity of a given skill supplied by the workforce and the quantity demanded by employers diverge at the existing market conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Labour market supplies and demands for occupational skills fluctuate continuously, so at times there will be imbalances in the labour market. In other words, a shortage/surplus is the result of a disequilibrium between the demand and supply for labour. In contrast, non-economic definitions are usually normative, i.e. there is a shortage of labour relative to defined norms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. In the case of health personnel, these definitions are based either on a value judgement &#x02013; for instance, how much care people should receive &#x02013; or on a professional determination &#x02013; such as deciding what is the appropriate number of physicians for the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature</title><p>One of the key questions regarding imbalances is how long these last: Is the imbalance temporary or permanent? In a competitive labour market, we should expect most imbalances to be resolved over time. Imbalances will tend to disappear faster the greater the reaction speed and also the greater the elasticity of supply (or demand) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. This type of imbalance (shortage or surplus) is defined as dynamic.</p><p>In contrast, a static imbalance occurs because supply does not increase or decrease; market equilibrium is therefore not achieved. For instance, wage adjustments may respond slowly to shifts in demand or supply as a result of institutional and regulatory arrangements, imperfect market competition (monopoly, monopsony) and wage-control policies. Another example is physicians' education: because of the length of time required to educate physicians, changes in available supply take a long time to react significantly. Lack of information on the state of the various labour markets can also be a factor in the speed of market adjustment. To make proper labour market decisions, households and firms must be informed of the existing market conditions across markets. They must therefore know what wages are paid and the nature and location of job openings and available workers.</p><p>Moreover, we should also differentiate between qualitative and quantitative imbalance. In a tight labour market, employers might not find the ideal candidate, but will still recruit someone. Under these conditions, the issue is the quality of job candidates rather than the quantity of people willing and able to do the job [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. From the employers' perspective, a shortage of workers exists; from the job-market perspective, the existence of a shortage could be questioned because the jobs are filled. One negative hidden impact of a qualitative shortage is the number of positions that are filled with ineffective individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A conceptual framework</title><p>To better understand the role of factors affecting health workforce imbalances and to facilitate the development of policy tools, a conceptual framework is presented in this section.</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Factors affecting health workforce imbalances are numerous and complex, but focusing on crucial elements should permit insight into the issue of health workforce imbalances. The framework is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> and contains six main components: the demand for health labour, the supply of health labour, the health care system, policies, resources and \"global\" factors.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F1\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Framework for imbalance of human resources for health</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-1\"/></fig><p>Central to this framework are the demand for and supply of health labour. Also included in the framework is the health care system, and in particular, some of its features that are likely to have an impact on health workforce imbalances. Policies constitute another crucial element of the framework. In effect, health policies but also non-health-oriented policies can have an impact on health workforce imbalances. The framework also incorporates financial, physical and knowledge resources that contribute to model the health workforce.Finally, \"global\" factors such as economic, sociodemographic, political, geographical and cultural factors are included. These elements contribute directly or indirectly to shaping and transforming the entire society and hence the health workforce.</p></sec><sec><title>The demand for health personnel</title><p>The first element of the framework to be examined is the demand for health personnel. The demand for health personnel can be considered as a derived demand for health services. Accordingly, we should consider factors determining the demand for health services. Personal characteristics &#x02013; such as health needs, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics &#x02013; and economic factors play an important role.</p><p>It has often been proposed that the planning of human resources for health be based solely on estimates of health needs in the population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. However, relying only on the concept of need is difficult, because it can be defined either broadly or restrictedly and accordingly lead to a perception of either systematic shortage or surplus. Health needs is only one of the factors affecting the demand for health personnel.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to estimate the impact of economic factors on the demand for health care. In particular in the United States, studies have attempted to estimate price and income elasticities of demand for medical services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. Measurements of price or income elasticities make it possible to evaluate the impact of a change in price or income on the demand for health care. Most studies reported elasticities in the range between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating that consumers tend to be responsive to price changes but that the degree of price sensitivity is not very large compared to that for many other goods and services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>Another element influencing the demand for health care is the value of a patient's time, such as travel time and waiting time. Acton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] found that in the United States, elasticity of demand with respect to travel time ranged between -0.6 and -1, meaning that a 10% increase in travel time would induce a reduction of 6%-10% in the demand for health care.</p><p>Other factors affect the demand for health labour. In particular, some specific features of the health care system and its features, policies, resources and environmental factors do have an impact on the demand for health labour. Their respective role will further discussed later.</p></sec><sec><title>The supply of human resources for health</title><p>After reviewing factors affecting the demand for health labour, we shall now turn to those affecting the supply of the health workforce. In particular, we shall consider the following elements: factors affecting the choice for a health professional training/education, participation in the health labour market and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Education/professional training choice</title><p>The availability of a renewed health workforce, as well as the type of profession and specialty chosen by individuals, is a major concern for health decision-makers. These issues are of particular relevance, especially since the number of younger people, predominantly women, choosing a nursing career is declining in some countries and since in professional training/education, individuals' choices do not always match the absorptive capacity of the market.</p><p>From an economic perspective, the decision to undertake professional training/education is considered an investment decision. To emphasize the essential similarities of these investments to other kinds of investments, economists refer to them as investment in human capital [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. Since investment decisions usually deliver payoffs over time, we must consider the entire stream of costs and benefits. The expected returns on human capital investments are a higher level of earnings, greater job satisfaction over one's lifetime and a greater appreciation of non-market activities and interests.</p><p>Based on the human capital approach, rate of return on education can be estimated. An average rate of return that is high and rising for a given profession will attract more individuals to that profession. On the other hand, a lower and decreasing average rate of return will discourage individuals from choosing that profession. Nowak and Preston [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], using the human capital approach, found that Australian nurses are poorly paid in comparison to other female professionals. The declining interest in nursing can be partly explained by the expansion of career opportunities in traditionally male-dominated occupations over the last three decades that entail a higher rate of return [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The number of young women entering the registered-nurse workforce has declined because many women who would have entered nursing in the past &#x02013; particularly those with high academic ability &#x02013; are now entering managerial and professional occupations that used to be traditionally male.</p><p>Besides the human capital approach, the choice of a profession can also be explained by sociopsychological factors. For instance, individuals may choose a profession because it is highly valued by the society or for family tradition. In the health sector, the satisfaction afforded by caring for people and assisting them to improve their health is an important element used by nursing schools to attract new enrollees. In the light of this approach, the decline in the number of individuals choosing nursing as a career might also be explained by the fact that this profession is now less socially valued than before [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participation in the labour market</title><p>The economic theory of the decision to work views the decision as a choice concerning how people spend their time. Individuals face a trade-off between labour and leisure. They decide how much of their time to spend working for pay or participating in leisure activities, the latter being activities that are not work-related.</p><p>An issue that has drawn a lot of attention recently is the impact of wage increases on labour participation, in particular for nurses. In the short term, higher wages can have at least two effects on the labour supply of current qualified nurses: first, qualified nurses who are working in other occupations may return to nursing activities; second, nurses now in practice may respond by working more hours. In the long run, higher wages in nursing relative to other occupations make nursing an attractive profession and will draw more people into nurse training programmes.</p><p>In their literature review of wage elasticity of nursing labour supply, Antonazzo et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] and Chiha and Link [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] found that most of the studies indicate a positive relationship, although not a strong one, between wages and labour supply. Accordingly, increases in nursing wages are unlikely to cause significant increases in labour participation. A literature review on the women's workforce undertaken by Killingsworth and Heckman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] indicated that in addition to wage rate, women's participation is responsive to changes in unearned income, spouse's wage and having children (particularly of pre-school age). Another aspect of labour supply decisions that has been investigated by Philips [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] is the costs associated with entering the nursing labour market (such as costs of child care and housework). The elasticity of participation with respect to changes in working costs was evaluated at -0.67 for all nurses. This suggests that a subsidy leading to a decrease of 10% in these costs would increase the participation of nurses by 6.7%.</p><p>Moreover, hospitals are also using a variety of strategies to recruit new staff. A survey of hospitals in the United States shows that richer benefits, such as health insurance and vacation time, are the most common incentives used. In addition, hospitals may offer other recruitment and retention benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, flexible hours and signing bonuses based on experience or length of commitment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. Many countries, but particularly developed ones, use such incentives to recruit new staff.</p><p>Economic factors also play a role in physician's participation in the labour market, as demonstrated by the impact of cost-containment policies in Canada, where most provincial governments have implemented an assortment of controls of health care expenses. Threshold reductions were introduced, so that fees payable to individual physicians were reduced as billing exceeded an agreed threshold. As a consequence, physicians who had billed at the threshold level chose to take leaves of absence rather than receive a level of reimbursement they considered inadequate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>].</p><p>When health personnel choose an alternative or additional occupation, this is likely to have consequences on health labour supply. In developing countries, and particularly in Africa, attempts to reform the health care sector have frequently failed to respond to the aspirations of staff concerning remuneration and working conditions. Salaries are often inadequate and may be paid late, and health workers try to solve their financial problems in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Private practice is only one of the many survival strategies that health personnel use to supplement their income and increase their job satisfaction. Teaching, attending training courses, supervision activities, research, trade and agriculture are some of these alternative strategies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Labour market exit</title><p>Parker and Rickam [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] examined the economic determinants of the labour force withdrawal of registered nurses in the United States, i.e. nurses leaving the profession to pursue a non-nursing occupation and employed nurses withdrawing from the labour force. Their results suggest that a significant number of registered nurses withdraw, at least temporarily, from the labour force. Among the significant elements influencing the withdrawal decision are the wage rate, other family income, presence of children and full-time/part-time work status. Increasing registered nurses' wages and working full-time is expected to reduce the probability of labour force withdrawal, whereas higher education levels, age and other family income increase the probability of labour force withdrawal.</p><p>The relative importance of wage is also emphasized by studies investigating job satisfaction. There is support in the empirical literature for the existence of job dissatisfaction among nurses, and the link between job dissatisfaction and job exit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]. In the United States the most important factors in nurses' resignation were, in order of importance: workload, staffing, time with patients, flexible scheduling, respect from nursing administration, increasing nursing knowledge, promotion opportunities, work stimulation, salary and decision-making. These studies suggest that salary is just one of the reasons why nurses are quitting. The relative importance of wage is confirmed by Shields and Ward [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]. Their results suggest that dissatisfaction with promotion and training opportunities has a stronger impact than workload or pay.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration</title><p>Migration of health personnel can have a serious impact on the supply of human resources in health, because it may exacerbate health personnel imbalances in \"sending\" countries. It is suggested that migration is an \"individual, spontaneous and voluntary act\" that is motivated by the perceived net gain of migrating &#x02013; that is, the gain will offset the tangible and intangible costs of moving [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Decisions to migrate are often a family strategy to produce a better income and improve survival chances [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>The reality for many health workers in developing countries is to be underpaid, poorly motivated and increasingly dissatisfied and sceptical [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. The relevance of motivation to migration is self-evident. There can be little doubt that for many health workers an improvement in pay and conditions will act as an incentive to stay in the country. Improved pensions, child care, educational opportunities and recognition are also known to be important [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. In Ghana it is estimated that only 191 of the 489 doctors who graduated between 1985 and 1994 were still working in the country in 1997 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Health system characteristics</title><p>As the health workforce is part of the health care system, we shall also consider features of the health care system that are likely to have an impact on the demand and supply of health labour. In particular, we shall examine market failures, the diversity of stakeholders, the supply-demand adjustment time lag and hospitals' potential monopsony power.</p></sec><sec><title>Market failures</title><p>From an economic perspective, the health care market is characterized by market failures &#x02013; that is, the assumptions for perfect competition are violated. From a societal perspective, in the presence of market failures such as externalities &#x02013; imperfect knowledge, asymmetry of information and uncertainty &#x02013; market mechanisms lead to a non-optimal demand and/or supply in health services. In other words, shortages and surpluses are likely to result from the health care market.</p><p>Most markets are characterized by market failures, but what is unique to the health services market is the extent of these market failures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Governments try to correct health care market failures through policy interventions. A classic example of public intervention in the presence of a positive externality is the introduction of a policy of mandatory vaccination. However, implementing such policies is sometimes difficult and may result in only partial correction of the market failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Stakeholders</title><p>The health care system is characterized by a wide range of institutional stakeholders involved in shaping human resources for health, all of whom may have different objectives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. The objectives of a union or professional association do not necessarily coincide, for example, with those of a government ministry, a hospital manager or the central government. Unions/professional associations seek to increase their members' market power, employment and income [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], whereas the ministry of finance will want more budget equilibrium and will favour measures to limit health care expenditures.</p><p>In the case of Mozambique, whereas the policy of employing national professionals by cooperation agencies has met with warm support from national cadres, its effect on the health sector is problematic [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. The prospect of immediate financial gains puts pressure on qualified professionals to leave their posts within the Mozambique National Health Service to take up management or consultant positions. The substantial investment in their training is therefore producing dubious direct returns to the National Health Service. More seriously perhaps, the presence of donor-paid jobs outside the health sector (as programme coordinators, researchers, etc.) is creating pressure on the Ministry of Health itself, exacerbating the imbalances in the National Health Service and creating incentives for trained Mozambicans to leave the public sector.</p></sec><sec><title>Time lag</title><p>Moreover, adjustments between the demand and supply for health personnel may take a long time. In the health care field; the time lag between education and practising may be quite substantial. To obtain licensure to practise medicine requires lengthy education and training, and the long lag time between a changed student intake and a change in supply has been noted [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]: supply adjustment for physicians is not immediate, but takes a long time.</p></sec><sec><title>Hospitals' potential monopsony power</title><p>A single entity that is the sole purchaser of labour is a <italic>monopsony</italic>. One example is the potential monopsony power of hospitals in hiring nurses or the ministry of health in hiring the health workforce. The amount of labour demanded will influence the price the monopsonist must pay for it. In contrast to the situation in a competitive market, the monopsony is a price maker, not a price taker. Monopsony results in lower wages and lower employment of nurses compared to a competitive market.</p><p>A number of studies have tested whether or not hospitals possess monopsony power with respect to nurses, and the results are contradictory. Sullivan [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>] and Staiger et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>] concluded that hospitals have a substantial degree of monopsony power. In contrast, Hirsch and Schumacher [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>] did not find empirical support for the monopsony model. Nurses' wages were found not to be related to hospital density and to decrease rather than increase with respect to labour market size.</p></sec><sec><title>Provider power/monopoly</title><p>In contrast, providers' power may enable the latter to restrict the supply of human resources for health. Seldon, Jung and Cavazos [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such avenues as restricting supply and price-fixing. In France, trade unions are granted an institutional role at establishment level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. In India and Sri Lanka, a clear constraint to support-services contracting was the inability to counter the power of the public service unions in dictating employment terms and conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. The varying degree of homogeneity of the different professional groups may also explain their relative success in maintaining a monopoly of practice. In Iceland, one of the factors that contributed to breaking the professional monopoly of pharmacists was division within the profession [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Regulations</title><p>The type off regulation associated with a profession plays an important role regarding the supply of members of a profession. Regulation has, by tradition, been achieved through a combination of direct government regulation and, to a large extent, through rules adopted by professional associations, whose self-regulatory powers enable them to establish both entry requirements and rules regarding professional conduct [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>].</p><p>Such barriers to entry exist in particular for doctors, but also in other health professions, such as dentistry. Some argue that these barriers constitute a means to limit entry into the profession, and hence maintain high incomes. Muzondo and Pazderka [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] established, for Canadian professional licensing restrictions, a relationship between different variables of self-regulation and higher income. Seldon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] suggest that physicians in the United States have market power through such sources as restricting supply and price-fixing. However, the proponents of self-regulation claim that these barriers are a means to provide health care of quality and to protect patients from incompetent providers. In contrast, although most countries have a professional nursing association, nurses tend to have limited power to regulate entry to the profession. This could be associated with a large diversity of specialist groups in nursing failing to unite on issues related to professional regulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Health and non-health policies</title><p>Health and non-health policies contribute to shaping the health care system and have an influence on the demand and supply of health labour.</p><p>Health policy can be defined as a formal statement or procedure within institutions (notably government) that defines priorities and the parameters for action in response to health needs, available resources and other political pressures. Health policy is often enacted through legislation or other forms of rule-making that create regulations and incentives for providing health services and programmes and access to them. For instance, the decision to introduce or expand health insurance coverage is likely to have an impact on the demand for health services. This is illustrated by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, a controlled experiment that increased knowledge about the effect of different insurance copayments on use of medical services. Insurance copayments ranged from zero to 95%. The RAND study concluded that as the co-insurance rose, overall use and expenditure fell for adults and children combined [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>].</p><p>Non-health policies reflect state interventions in areas such as employment, education and regional development that contribute to shaping the health workforce. These policies do not directly address health issues, but have an indirect impact on such issues. In France, a controversial new regulation was introduced that reduced the workweek to a maximum of 35 hours in an attempt both to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and to achieve greater flexibility in the labour force. Unions responded by demanding the creation of more posts in public hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial, physical and knowledge resources</title><p>Financial, physical and knowledge resources are crucial to any type of health care workforce. The level of resources attributed to the health care system, and how these resources are used, will have a significant impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>In terms of financial resources, human resources account for a high proportion of national budgets assigned to the health sector [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Health expenditure claims an increasingly important share of the gross domestic product and, in most countries, wage costs (salaries, bonuses and other payments) are estimated to account for between 65% and 80% of the renewable health system expenditure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>].</p><p>Physical resources include human resources within the health sector and other sectors; buildings and engineering services such as sanitation, water and heating systems for community use and for the use of medical care institutions; and equipment and supplies. Finally, the health workforce is also constrained by its human capital. This human capital can be associated with the qualification and education of the health workforce. Education of the health workforce is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given in preparation for work.</p></sec><sec><title>Global factors</title><p>Economic, sociodemographic, cultural, and geographical factors contribute to shaping and transforming society and hence have a direct or indirect impact on health workforce issues.</p><p>From an economic perspective, for instance, there is evidence of a correlation between the level of economic development of a country and its level of human resources for health. Countries with higher GDP per capita are said to spend more on health care than countries with lower income, as demonstrated by cross-sectional studies, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>] and hence would also tend to have larger health workforces.</p><p>Moreover, both the demand and supply are likely to be affected by sociodemographic elements such as the age distribution of the population. On the demand side, the ageing of the population is giving rise to an increase in the demand for health services and health personnel, especially nurses for home care.</p><p>On the supply side, the ageing of the health workforce, and in particular of nurses, has serious implications for the future of the nursing labour market. For example, the Institute of Medicine noted that older registered nurses have a reduced capacity to perform certain tasks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. It was found that between 1983 and 1998 the average age of practising registered nurses increased by more than four years, from 37.4 to 41.9 years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. In contrast, the average age of the United States workforce as a whole increased by less than two years during the same period. Furthermore, the proportion of the registered-nurse workforce younger than 30 years decreased from 30.3% to 12.1% during this period.</p><p>Geographical and cultural factors also play a role in determining the demand and supply of human resources. Geographical characteristics affect the organization of health services delivery. For instance, a country with many islands or with isolated population groups will face particular challenges in terms of health workforce issues. Similarly, significant climatic changes are likely to give rise to changes in health needs, which in turn will call for changes in health services and in the health workforce. Finally, both cultural and political values also affect the demand for and supply of human resources for health.</p></sec><sec><title>Health workforce imbalances: a typology</title><p>This section considers a typology of imbalances, and differentiates between the following:</p><p>&#x02022; Profession/specialty imbalances: Under this category, we consider imbalance in the various health professions, such as doctors or nurses, as well as shortages within a profession, e.g. shortage of one type of specialists.</p><p>&#x02022; Geographical imbalances: These are disparities between urban and rural regions and poor and rich regions.</p><p>&#x02022; Institutional and services imbalances: These are differences in health workforce supply between health care facilities, as well as between services.</p><p>&#x02022; Gender imbalances: These are disparities in female/male representation in the health workforce.</p><sec><title>Profession/specialty imbalances</title><p>Imbalances have been reported for almost all health professions, and in particular for nurses. The United States General Accounting Office [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>] reports a nursing shortage. However, the nursing shortage has not been institution-wide but is concentrated in specialty care areas, particularly intensive care units and operating rooms [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The shortage of registered nurses in intensive care units is explained in part by the sharp decline in the number of younger registered nurses, whom intensive care units have historically attracted. Shortages in operating rooms probably reflect that many registered nurses who work in this setting are reaching the age when they are beginning to reduce their hours worked or are retiring altogether.</p><p>Major variations occur in the number of health care workers per capita population and in the skill mix employed across countries, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor ratio varies widely from one country to another, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>. The nurse/doctor skill mix is important and may have consequences for the respective tasks of nurses and doctors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that these variations are taking place among countries with a relatively similar economic development level.</p><fig position=\"float\" id=\"F2\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of physicians, nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists in selected countries. WHO data, 2000.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"1478-4491-2-13-2\"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Geographical imbalances</title><p>Virtually all countries suffer from a geographical maldistribution of human resources for health, and the primary area of concern is usually the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In both industrialized and developing countries, urban areas almost invariably have a substantially higher concentration of physicians than rural areas.</p><p>Understandably, most health care professionals prefer to settle in urban areas, which offer opportunities for professional development as well as education and other amenities for themselves and their families. But it is in the rural and remote areas, especially in the developing countries, that most severe public health problems are found.</p><p>The geographical maldistribution of doctors has been the object of particular attention. In general there is a higher concentration of general practitioners in the inner suburbs of the metropolitan areas. According to the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>], the reasons for high concentration of general practitioners in inner city areas are:</p><p>&#x02022; historical</p><p>&#x02022; lifestyle-related: access to amenities</p><p>&#x02022; spouse/husband-related: greater employment opportunities</p><p>&#x02022; child-related: better access to secondary and tertiary education services</p><p>&#x02022; professional, family and social ties and professional ambitions.</p><p>The geographical distribution of health care personnel is an important issue in many countries. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, contains one-fifth of the country's population but around half of the available health personnel [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>]. In Bangladesh, most of the doctors (35%) and nurses (30%) in health services are located in four metropolitan districts where only 14.5% of the population lives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B70\">70</xref>]. This concentration pattern is characteristic of developing countries.</p><p>In Indonesia the geographical distribution of physicians is a particular concern, since Indonesia's vast size and difficult geography present a tremendous challenge to health service delivery [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B71\">71</xref>]. It is difficult to place doctors in remote islands or mountain or forest locations with few amenities, no opportunities for private practice, and poor communications with the rest of the country.</p><p>To improve the geographical distribution of physicians, governments often have used combinations of compulsory service and incentives. So far, there is virtually no country in the world that has solved the problem of a rural/urban imbalance of the physician workforce [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. This does not necessarily mean that policies and programmes designed to reduce the imbalance have had no effect. For example, Thailand has successfully begun to stem the migration of health professionals from rural to urban areas and from public to private facilities with a range of strong financial incentives [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B72\">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Institutional and services imbalances</title><p>Institutional imbalances occur when some health care facilities have too many staff because of prestige, working conditions, ability to generate additional income, or other situation-specific factors, while others are understaffed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B73\">73</xref>]. Institutions such as magnet hospitals, for example, are hospitals characterized by adequate to excellent staffing, low turnover, rich nursing skill mix and greater job satisfaction, among other factors, even in the face of a general health personnel shortage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B74\">74</xref>].</p><p>Imbalance between the types of health services provided may also arise. In particular, we can consider the issue of curative versus preventive care. In effect, it has been estimated that most diseases (80%) and accidents are preventable through known methodologies, yet at present there is an imbalance in the funding of medical research, with only 1%-2% going to prevention and 98%-99% spent on curative approaches [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B75\">75</xref>]. This imbalance in funding raises the question of a health workforce imbalance between preventive and curative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Gender imbalances</title><p>In many countries, women still tend to concentrate in the lower-status health occupations and to be a minority among more highly trained professionals and managers. In Bangladesh, the distribution by gender of the health workforce shows that the total proportion of women accounts for little more than one-fifth in health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>]. The distribution of women by occupational category is biased in favour of nurses. Women are very poorly represented in other categories, such as dentists, medical assistants, pharmacists, managers/trainers and doctors. The underrepresentation of women in managerial and decision-making positions may lead to less attention to and poorer understanding of the problems specific to women and the particularities of their utilization patterns [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B77\">77</xref>].</p><p>Female general practitioners have been shown to practise differently from males, managing different types of medical conditions, with some differences due to patient mix and patient selectivity, and others inherent in the sex of physician. In some more traditional areas, some women will not seek care for themselves or even for their children because they do not have access to a female provider [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This framework can be used to assess policy reforms and their impact on health workforce imbalances; it also provides a common framework for cross-country comparisons. This framework emphasizes the number and type of factors affecting health workforce imbalances, illustrating the complexity of this issue. From a policy perspective, it is particularly interesting to identify factors that policy-makers can influence in order to remedy imbalance problems.</p><p>Various monetary and non-monetary incentives are used to influence the supply and/or demand for the health workforce. For example, subsidies, grants and scholarships are examples of incentives that can be used to attract more nursing students, whereas wage increases, additional benefits and working hours flexibility are examples of commonly used incentives to attract or retain the health workforce.</p><p>The numerous factors and actors involved in the health workforce imbalance issue call for a coherent health workforce vision and policy. In that context, health planning plays an important role since it contributes to shaping the health care system. Moreover, since from a societal perspective market mechanisms alone do not allow an adequate demand/supply of health personnel to be reached, public interventions such as human resources planning are a means to correct for market failures. Health planning involves a time horizon. Forecasting the future number of health personnel needed and developing policies to meet such figures are common to any health care system. Physicians represent the profession for which more planning effort has been expended to achieve a workforce of appropriate size than for any other health profession. Countries' desire to meet population health needs and to avoid social welfare losses resulting from a shortage or an oversupply are factors explaining, to a large extent, the importance attributed to planning in the context of public health policies.</p><p>The policy implications of forecasting either a shortage or a surplus of health care personnel are different, and hence attempts at projections must be rigorous. For instance, referring to previous studies predicting significant surpluses, Cooper [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B78\">78</xref>] notes that such large surpluses have not occurred so far, because of a decrease in physician work effort. Factors such as age, sex and lifestyle contributed to this evolution.</p><p>As a result of forecasted physician surpluses, various policy recommendations have been formulated. The United States Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B79\">79</xref>] published a report recommending, among other things, that there be no new medical schools, that existing schools should not increase their class size and that the number of first-year residency positions should be reduced. The Pew Health Professions Commission Report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B80\">80</xref>] issued a report recommending more severe steps, such as the closing of some medical schools and tightening the visa process for international medical graduates.</p><p>This framework also apprehends the different types of imbalances. This is important since the choice of a policy will also depend on the type of imbalance. Significant disparities in human resources for health between health occupation, regions, gender or health services are recognized as classic problems of imbalance. However, the question of a public/private imbalance is more debatable. One the one hand, we can argue that for equity and access, a health care system should have a strong public component. On the other hand, we can imagine a private-sector oriented health care system with mechanisms to ensure access to the poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of imbalances in the health workforce, this paper has discussed a framework for human resources for health and proposed a typology of imbalances. Although the term \"imbalance\" is commonly used with respect to the health workforce, it is clear that imbalance in the health workforce encompasses a wide range of possible situations and is a complex issue. The use of a framework should facilitate the development of policy tools and their assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'

When a vaccine is administered, it introduces a harmless component of the pathogen (like an inactivated virus, a piece of its genetic material, or a protein) into the body. This prompts the immune system to produce an immune response, including the production of antibodies. \n\nThese antibodies help the body recognize and fight the pathogen if it is encountered again in the future. Additionally, vaccines can stimulate the formation of memory cells, which \"remember\" the pathogen and enable the immune system to mount a quicker and more effective response upon re-exposure.

Although the localization of centrioles within the centrosome together with their precise duplication prior to mitosis has suggested a role in bipolar spindle assembly or function, the actual role of centrioles in cell division remains unclear and controversial. Cells from which centrioles and centrosomes are ablated can still form bipolar spindles via a centrosome-independent self-organization process, but the effectiveness of such spindles in terms of chromosome segregation has not been carefully measured. Based on the circumstantial evidence that tumor cells which display genomic instability also frequently show aberrations in centriole structure or copy number [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>], it has been proposed that centrioles may participate in the maintenance of genomic stability. If centrioles play a role in chromosome segregation, then mutations in genes encoding centriolar proteins would be expected to result in genomic instability.</p><p>The EF-hand protein centrin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] is one of the few identified centriolar proteins. Centrin is found in all eukaryotes, and is localized to centrioles in vertebrate cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>], basal bodies in green algae [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>], and spindle pole bodies (SPBs) in yeast [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. Centrin is functionally required for centriole duplication [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>] and inheritance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. RNAi experiments in mammalian and algal cells have indicated that reduction of centrin can result in cell division arrest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>] and cytokinesis failure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>]. However, it is unclear if these defects are indirectly caused by abnormal centriole structure or copy number, or if instead they represent pleiotropic effects due to the direct participation of centrin in the cell division process. Centrin also appears to be involved in many other cellular processes, including flagellar excision [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], nuclear mRNA export [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>], cell membrane integrity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>] and homologous recombination [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. Consistent with these multiple roles, centrin localization is not restricted to centrioles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>], and centrin has been identified as a component of nuclear pores and flagellar dynein complexes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>]. Centrin is thus a versatile molecule that has been adapted to perform multiple diverse cellular functions. Given the fact that centrin localizes to centrioles, which are potentially involved in genome maintenance, together with the fact that centrin is functionally involved in centriole duplication and segregation, an obvious question is whether centrin plays a role in genomic stability. In this report we address this question using a centrin mutation in the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Genomic instability in the centrin mutant <italic>vfl2-1</italic></title><p>We tested whether centrin plays a role in genomic instability using a genetic assay for loss of heterozygosity in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>(<italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>refers to <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardti </italic>throughout) is a unicellular green alga with genetics similar to yeast, but which, unlike yeast, has centrioles (known as basal bodies) that are virtually identical to centrioles of vertebrate cells. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, centrin polymerizes into long fibers that link the centrioles/basal bodies to the nucleus. These fibers are called the nucleus basal body connectors (NBBCs) or rhizoplasts [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. The <italic>vfl2-1 </italic>mutant has a point mutation in the centrin gene [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>], and these mutants produce a reduced quantity of centrin protein that is unable to polymerize into a rhizoplast. The <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutation appears to result in a defect in centriole segregation, because mutant cells have a variable number of centrioles (between zero and six per cell). Despite their centriole number variation, these mutants are viable and form seemingly normal bipolar mitotic spindles. It has been argued on this basis that centrin-based rhizoplasts do not play a role in mitosis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Importantly, the centrioles in a <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant cell are not located at the spindle poles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], consistent with ultrastructural studies showing that, in green algae, centrioles are joined to the spindle poles by centrin-based fibers derived from the rhizoplast [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. The high viability of <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants thus allows us to measure genomic instability using genetic assays because populations of mutant cells can be grown for a sufficient number of generations to allow rare chromosome loss events to be detected.</p><p>We measured genomic instability in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants using a simple genetic assay for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) previously developed by Dutcher and coworkers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. This assay uses the <italic>act2 </italic>mutation, which confers recessive resistance to cycloheximide [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>]. The <italic>act2 </italic>heterozygous diploids are sensitive to cycloheximide, while homozygous or hemizygous <italic>act2 </italic>diploids are cycloheximide-resistant. When a diploid culture is plated on media containing cycloheximide, only cells that have lost the wild-type <italic>ACT2 </italic>allele can grow. By measuring the frequency with which such cells arise, the rate of chromosome loss can be calculated (see Methods). As illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>, using 48 independently constructed diploid lines each for wild type and <italic>vfl2</italic>, we found that the LOH rate per cell division increased from 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3 </sup>&#x000b1; 1.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>SEM (n = 48) in wild type, to 8.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3 </sup>&#x000b1; 5.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>SEM (n = 48) in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants. This difference is statistically significant (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.00005 based on one-tailed Welch's approximate <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>t </italic>= 12.2). The increase in loss of heterozygosity in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>centrin mutant relative to wild-type cells indicates that centrin plays a role in genomic stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic instability occurs via chromosome loss</title><p>In principle the LOH seen in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants could occur either by increased recombination or increased chromosome loss (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>). The latter would be consistent with a role for centrin or centrioles in mitotic spindle function, while an effect on recombination would suggest a spindle-independent role in DNA maintenance or chromosome dynamics. It is critical to distinguish these pathways because a role for centrin in DNA recombination and repair has been documented in plants [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. Given the close phylogenetic relation between green algae like <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>and green plants, the involvement of centrin in recombination in plants raises the real possibility that the loss of heterozygosity observed in <italic>vfl2 </italic>might have nothing to do with mitotic spindle function and might instead be driven by increased recombination.</p><p>In order to determine whether genomic instability in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant is caused by increased recombination or chromosome loss, we distinguished between the two pathways by analyzing the mating type (<italic>MT</italic>) locus, which is located on the opposite arm of the same chromosome from <italic>ACT2 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>). Diploid cells are heterozygous at <italic>MT </italic>and contain both the <italic>MT+ </italic>and <italic>MT- </italic>alleles. Because the <italic>ACT2 </italic>and <italic>MT </italic>loci are on opposite arms of the same chromosome, and recombination only causes LOH on a single arm distal to the crossover site, it can be inferred that only chromosome loss, and not mitotic recombination, could lead to the simultaneous loss of both the wild-type <italic>ACT2 </italic>gene and the <italic>MT+ </italic>allele (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>).</p><p>We therefore tested lines that had undergone LOH at the <italic>ACT2 </italic>locus for chromosome loss versus recombination, by analyzing the <italic>MT </italic>locus using PCR primers specific for the <italic>MT- </italic>and <italic>MT+ </italic>alleles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. As illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>, prior to selection on cycloheximide, all wild-type and <italic>vfl2/vfl2 </italic>diploid lines were indeed diploid, as judged by the fact that they were heterozygous at the <italic>MT </italic>locus and contained both <italic>MT+ </italic>and <italic>MT- </italic>alleles as expected for a diploid. In wild type, of 96 independently constructed diploid lines selected on cycloheximide, only two lines showed concomitant loss of the <italic>MT+ </italic>allele and, therefore, chromosome loss. In contrast, of 96 cycloheximide resistant <italic>vfl2 </italic>lines, we found that 27 had also lost the <italic>MT+ </italic>allele, loss of which indicated that the lines had undergone chromosome loss. These chromosome loss events apparently represent the loss of individual chromosomes rather than an overall return to haploidy, as the cells were able to grow on media lacking arginine and thus seemed to have retained the two homologs of the chromosome containing the <italic>arg2/arg7 </italic>mutations used to select for diploidy (see Methods). The difference in the proportion of LOH events due to chromosome loss (2/96 for wild type vs. 27/96 for <italic>vfl2</italic>) was highly significant (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.00001 based on Fisher's Exact Test). Multiplying the LOH rate by the fraction of LOH events due to chromosome loss, we found that the total rate of chromosome loss per cell division increased almost 100-fold, from 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>in wild type to 2.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3 </sup>in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell death during G1 in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants</title><p>The fact that <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants show increased chromosome loss in the genetic assay described above leads to the prediction that haploid <italic>vfl2 </italic>cells should frequently produce inviable progeny cells. This prediction follows from the fact that all <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>chromosomes contain essential genes, so a single chromosome loss event for any of the 17 chromosomes should produce an inviable progeny cell when haploid cell division are analyzed. (Note: chromosome loss did not lead to death in the experiments described above because those assays were conducted using diploid cells. Thus, chromosome loss led only to monosomy rather than nullisomy.) Consistent with this prediction, analysis of cell viability using the vital stain phenosaffranin indicated that <italic>vfl2 </italic>cultures contain a higher fraction of inviable cells than wild type (data not shown).</p><p>In order to test this prediction more quantitatively, we examined the outcomes of individual cell division events. Synchronized cultures of haploid <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>cells were embedded in agarose pads under a coverslip and imaged during G1 (as judged by time relative to the light-dark cycle and by the presence of flagella on most cells) by phase contrast microscopy as previously described [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>]. Viable cells were identified and their position marked, and then their progeny were examined during the first G1 phase after division. Only cells that divided successfully to give two or four progeny were scored (note that sometimes, depending on cell size at the commitment point, <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>cells can undergo two or three rapid division cycles during the dark phase of the circadian cycle). As a test of the methodology, we compared outcomes of division for wild-type cells and <italic>fla10-1 </italic>mutant cells grown at 21&#x000b0;C. The <italic>fla10-1 </italic>mutation occurs in a kinesin involved in flagellar assembly, and it has been reported that <italic>fla10-1 </italic>mutants show an increased rate of mitotic chromosome loss when grown at the permissive temperature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. If chromosome loss leads to increased production of inviable progeny, then this should be detectable in our analysis. Indeed, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref>, <italic>fla10-1 </italic>cells showed a significant increase in the fraction of divisions producing inviable progeny.</p><p>We then applied this method to <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant cells. As indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref>, we found that <italic>vfl2 </italic>showed a similar level of inviable progeny production as was observed in <italic>fla10 </italic>and significantly higher than in wild type. The cell death was observed during the first G1 after division and therefore did not result from a prolonged arrest or from a failure during subsequent S phase or mitosis. Dead cells were often roughly similar in size to their live siblings, suggesting that they were initially able to grow but eventually became inviable as they grew. In most cases the viable sibling cells retained flagella, indicating the culture had not yet reached the first S phase (at which time flagella are resorbed in <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>preparatory to division), confirming that death occurred during G1. This cell death during G1 is consistent with increased chromosome loss during mitosis, which should result in death during growth as essential gene products become depleted. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the cell death results from other defects in cell division.</p><p>In order to test whether supernumerary centrioles might cause the elevated cell death we observed, we asked whether the cell division defects in <italic>vfl2 </italic>correlated with the number of centrioles present. As previously shown, the fact that all centrioles are active as basal bodies in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants allows the number of centrioles to be inferred from the number of flagella [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>]. We therefore examined the outcome of cell divisions of cells having either the correct centriole copy number (n = 2), too few centrioles (n&#x0003c;2) or supernumerary centrioles (n&#x0003e;2). As indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref>, the fractions of inviable progeny were statistically similar for all three classes. We especially note that the cells with supernumerary centrioles did not show an increase in cell death after division.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>These results demonstrate that the <italic>vfl2-1 </italic>point mutation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>] in centrin leads to increased genomic instability via an increase in chromosome loss, suggesting that centrin plays a role in mitotic chromosome segregation. Formally, these results suggest that the gene encoding centrin could act as a \"housekeeper\" type tumor suppressor gene, which when mutated would predispose a cell to tumorigenesis indirectly by increasing genomic instability.</p><p>The mechanism by which the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutation leads to increased chromosome loss is unknown. The chromosome missegregation seen in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>centrin mutant is reminiscent of the Ipl (<underline>i</underline>ncrease in <underline>pl</underline>oidy) phenotype seen in yeast mutants defective in the yeast centrin homolog <italic>CDC31 </italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>], which is presumably due to a failure to form a mitotic spindle. By analogy with <italic>cdc31 </italic>mutants, it is then possible that the chromosome loss in <italic>vfl2 </italic>results from defective spindles. However, unlike in yeast where the spindle pole body is absolutely necessary to form a mitotic spindle, in higher eukaryotes it has been shown that bipolar spindles can self-assemble in the absence of centrioles or centrosomes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>]. Thus it was not obvious a priori that a defect in a centriole-associated protein (such as centrin) should have any effect on mitosis. Indeed, in the specific case of the <italic>Chlamydomonas vfl2 </italic>mutant, it has previously been reported that even though the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutation causes centrioles to detach from the spindle poles, the acentriolar spindles are nonetheless still bipolar [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. On this basis it was concluded by Wright and coworkers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>] that centrin does not play a role in mitosis. It might therefore seem surprising that we find an increase in chromosome loss in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant. However, while the ability of cells lacking centrioles or centrosomes to form bipolar spindles is well documented, and these spindles can be seen to undergo an apparently normal anaphase chromosome separation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>], the question of whether such acentriolar spindles might have an altered fidelity of chromosome segregation compared to normal spindles has never been directly addressed. We speculate that the chromosome missegregation we observe in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant reflects a decreased effectiveness of acentriolar spindles that self-assemble in this mutant. This would suggest a mitotic fidelity function for centrioles, which requires not merely the presence of centrioles in the cell, but also their specific localization at the spindle pole.</p><p>Alternatively, the chromosome loss we observe could be a byproduct of multipolar spindles. A small fraction (less than 1%) of <italic>vfl2 </italic>cells have three or more centrioles that could in theory give rise to tripolar or tetrapolar spindles. We suspect this is not the case because only bipolar spindles have been observed in these mutants [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Moreover, since centrioles are not located at spindle poles in this mutant, it is unlikely that the number of centrioles would have any effect on the number of spindle poles. The lack of centrioles at the poles also rules out configurations such as those seen during mitosis in multinucleate PtK1 cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], when multiple centriole pairs line up on either side of a single metaphase plate to form a masked multipolar spindle. Furthermore, to the extent that production of inviable cells during mitosis reflects chromosome loss, the data of Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref> argue against multipolar spindles playing a dominant role in chromosome loss since cells containing supernumerary centrioles do not show any increase in the rate of production of inviable progeny cells.</p><p>It is also possible that the chromosome loss in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants arises through a spindle-independent mechanism. Because centrin may be involved in nuclear transport [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], it is possible that the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutation could cause defects in chromosome organization due to a nuclear trafficking defect, leading indirectly to chromosome loss. We also note that disruption of centrin by RNAi in <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>has been reported to cause cytokinesis defects leading to binucleate cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>]. However such a cytokinesis defect cannot explain our results because the LOH assay we employed selects for loss of <italic>ACT2</italic>, rather than the presence of additional copies. Detailed cell-biological analysis of centrin mutant cells during division will be necessary to understand the basis of the chromosome loss we have observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found that a mutation in the centriole-associated protein centrin, which causes affected cells to form acentriolar spindles and lack centrin-based fibers, produces an increase in genomic instability caused by an increase in the rate of chromosome loss. These results indicate that either centrioles or the centrin protein itself are involved in increasing the fidelity of mitotic chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"methods\"><title>Methods</title><p>Heterozygous <italic>act2 </italic>diploid cells were constructed by crossing haploid strains of genotypes <italic>act2 arg7 mt- </italic>&#x000d7; <italic>ACT2 arg2 mt+</italic>.

Although the localization of centrioles within the centrosome together with their precise duplication prior to mitosis has suggested a role in bipolar spindle assembly or function, the actual role of centrioles in cell division remains unclear and controversial. Cells from which centrioles and centrosomes are ablated can still form bipolar spindles via a centrosome-independent self-organization process, but the effectiveness of such spindles in terms of chromosome segregation has not been carefully measured. Based on the circumstantial evidence that tumor cells which display genomic instability also frequently show aberrations in centriole structure or copy number [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>], it has been proposed that centrioles may participate in the maintenance of genomic stability. If centrioles play a role in chromosome segregation, then mutations in genes encoding centriolar proteins would be expected to result in genomic instability.</p><p>The EF-hand protein centrin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] is one of the few identified centriolar proteins. Centrin is found in all eukaryotes, and is localized to centrioles in vertebrate cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>], basal bodies in green algae [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>], and spindle pole bodies (SPBs) in yeast [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. Centrin is functionally required for centriole duplication [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>] and inheritance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. RNAi experiments in mammalian and algal cells have indicated that reduction of centrin can result in cell division arrest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>] and cytokinesis failure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>]. However, it is unclear if these defects are indirectly caused by abnormal centriole structure or copy number, or if instead they represent pleiotropic effects due to the direct participation of centrin in the cell division process. Centrin also appears to be involved in many other cellular processes, including flagellar excision [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], nuclear mRNA export [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>], cell membrane integrity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>] and homologous recombination [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. Consistent with these multiple roles, centrin localization is not restricted to centrioles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>], and centrin has been identified as a component of nuclear pores and flagellar dynein complexes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>]. Centrin is thus a versatile molecule that has been adapted to perform multiple diverse cellular functions. Given the fact that centrin localizes to centrioles, which are potentially involved in genome maintenance, together with the fact that centrin is functionally involved in centriole duplication and segregation, an obvious question is whether centrin plays a role in genomic stability. In this report we address this question using a centrin mutation in the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Genomic instability in the centrin mutant <italic>vfl2-1</italic></title><p>We tested whether centrin plays a role in genomic instability using a genetic assay for loss of heterozygosity in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>(<italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>refers to <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardti </italic>throughout) is a unicellular green alga with genetics similar to yeast, but which, unlike yeast, has centrioles (known as basal bodies) that are virtually identical to centrioles of vertebrate cells. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, centrin polymerizes into long fibers that link the centrioles/basal bodies to the nucleus. These fibers are called the nucleus basal body connectors (NBBCs) or rhizoplasts [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. The <italic>vfl2-1 </italic>mutant has a point mutation in the centrin gene [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>], and these mutants produce a reduced quantity of centrin protein that is unable to polymerize into a rhizoplast. The <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutation appears to result in a defect in centriole segregation, because mutant cells have a variable number of centrioles (between zero and six per cell). Despite their centriole number variation, these mutants are viable and form seemingly normal bipolar mitotic spindles. It has been argued on this basis that centrin-based rhizoplasts do not play a role in mitosis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Importantly, the centrioles in a <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant cell are not located at the spindle poles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], consistent with ultrastructural studies showing that, in green algae, centrioles are joined to the spindle poles by centrin-based fibers derived from the rhizoplast [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. The high viability of <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants thus allows us to measure genomic instability using genetic assays because populations of mutant cells can be grown for a sufficient number of generations to allow rare chromosome loss events to be detected.</p><p>We measured genomic instability in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants using a simple genetic assay for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) previously developed by Dutcher and coworkers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. This assay uses the <italic>act2 </italic>mutation, which confers recessive resistance to cycloheximide [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>]. The <italic>act2 </italic>heterozygous diploids are sensitive to cycloheximide, while homozygous or hemizygous <italic>act2 </italic>diploids are cycloheximide-resistant. When a diploid culture is plated on media containing cycloheximide, only cells that have lost the wild-type <italic>ACT2 </italic>allele can grow. By measuring the frequency with which such cells arise, the rate of chromosome loss can be calculated (see Methods). As illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>, using 48 independently constructed diploid lines each for wild type and <italic>vfl2</italic>, we found that the LOH rate per cell division increased from 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3 </sup>&#x000b1; 1.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>SEM (n = 48) in wild type, to 8.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3 </sup>&#x000b1; 5.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>SEM (n = 48) in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants. This difference is statistically significant (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.00005 based on one-tailed Welch's approximate <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>t </italic>= 12.2). The increase in loss of heterozygosity in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>centrin mutant relative to wild-type cells indicates that centrin plays a role in genomic stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic instability occurs via chromosome loss</title><p>In principle the LOH seen in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants could occur either by increased recombination or increased chromosome loss (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>). The latter would be consistent with a role for centrin or centrioles in mitotic spindle function, while an effect on recombination would suggest a spindle-independent role in DNA maintenance or chromosome dynamics. It is critical to distinguish these pathways because a role for centrin in DNA recombination and repair has been documented in plants [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. Given the close phylogenetic relation between green algae like <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>and green plants, the involvement of centrin in recombination in plants raises the real possibility that the loss of heterozygosity observed in <italic>vfl2 </italic>might have nothing to do with mitotic spindle function and might instead be driven by increased recombination.</p><p>In order to determine whether genomic instability in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant is caused by increased recombination or chromosome loss, we distinguished between the two pathways by analyzing the mating type (<italic>MT</italic>) locus, which is located on the opposite arm of the same chromosome from <italic>ACT2 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>). Diploid cells are heterozygous at <italic>MT </italic>and contain both the <italic>MT+ </italic>and <italic>MT- </italic>alleles. Because the <italic>ACT2 </italic>and <italic>MT </italic>loci are on opposite arms of the same chromosome, and recombination only causes LOH on a single arm distal to the crossover site, it can be inferred that only chromosome loss, and not mitotic recombination, could lead to the simultaneous loss of both the wild-type <italic>ACT2 </italic>gene and the <italic>MT+ </italic>allele (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>).</p><p>We therefore tested lines that had undergone LOH at the <italic>ACT2 </italic>locus for chromosome loss versus recombination, by analyzing the <italic>MT </italic>locus using PCR primers specific for the <italic>MT- </italic>and <italic>MT+ </italic>alleles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. As illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>, prior to selection on cycloheximide, all wild-type and <italic>vfl2/vfl2 </italic>diploid lines were indeed diploid, as judged by the fact that they were heterozygous at the <italic>MT </italic>locus and contained both <italic>MT+ </italic>and <italic>MT- </italic>alleles as expected for a diploid. In wild type, of 96 independently constructed diploid lines selected on cycloheximide, only two lines showed concomitant loss of the <italic>MT+ </italic>allele and, therefore, chromosome loss. In contrast, of 96 cycloheximide resistant <italic>vfl2 </italic>lines, we found that 27 had also lost the <italic>MT+ </italic>allele, loss of which indicated that the lines had undergone chromosome loss. These chromosome loss events apparently represent the loss of individual chromosomes rather than an overall return to haploidy, as the cells were able to grow on media lacking arginine and thus seemed to have retained the two homologs of the chromosome containing the <italic>arg2/arg7 </italic>mutations used to select for diploidy (see Methods). The difference in the proportion of LOH events due to chromosome loss (2/96 for wild type vs. 27/96 for <italic>vfl2</italic>) was highly significant (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.00001 based on Fisher's Exact Test). Multiplying the LOH rate by the fraction of LOH events due to chromosome loss, we found that the total rate of chromosome loss per cell division increased almost 100-fold, from 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>in wild type to 2.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3 </sup>in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell death during G1 in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants</title><p>The fact that <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants show increased chromosome loss in the genetic assay described above leads to the prediction that haploid <italic>vfl2 </italic>cells should frequently produce inviable progeny cells. This prediction follows from the fact that all <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>chromosomes contain essential genes, so a single chromosome loss event for any of the 17 chromosomes should produce an inviable progeny cell when haploid cell division are analyzed. (Note: chromosome loss did not lead to death in the experiments described above because those assays were conducted using diploid cells. Thus, chromosome loss led only to monosomy rather than nullisomy.) Consistent with this prediction, analysis of cell viability using the vital stain phenosaffranin indicated that <italic>vfl2 </italic>cultures contain a higher fraction of inviable cells than wild type (data not shown).</p><p>In order to test this prediction more quantitatively, we examined the outcomes of individual cell division events. Synchronized cultures of haploid <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>cells were embedded in agarose pads under a coverslip and imaged during G1 (as judged by time relative to the light-dark cycle and by the presence of flagella on most cells) by phase contrast microscopy as previously described [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>]. Viable cells were identified and their position marked, and then their progeny were examined during the first G1 phase after division. Only cells that divided successfully to give two or four progeny were scored (note that sometimes, depending on cell size at the commitment point, <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>cells can undergo two or three rapid division cycles during the dark phase of the circadian cycle). As a test of the methodology, we compared outcomes of division for wild-type cells and <italic>fla10-1 </italic>mutant cells grown at 21&#x000b0;C. The <italic>fla10-1 </italic>mutation occurs in a kinesin involved in flagellar assembly, and it has been reported that <italic>fla10-1 </italic>mutants show an increased rate of mitotic chromosome loss when grown at the permissive temperature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. If chromosome loss leads to increased production of inviable progeny, then this should be detectable in our analysis. Indeed, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref>, <italic>fla10-1 </italic>cells showed a significant increase in the fraction of divisions producing inviable progeny.</p><p>We then applied this method to <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant cells. As indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref>, we found that <italic>vfl2 </italic>showed a similar level of inviable progeny production as was observed in <italic>fla10 </italic>and significantly higher than in wild type. The cell death was observed during the first G1 after division and therefore did not result from a prolonged arrest or from a failure during subsequent S phase or mitosis. Dead cells were often roughly similar in size to their live siblings, suggesting that they were initially able to grow but eventually became inviable as they grew. In most cases the viable sibling cells retained flagella, indicating the culture had not yet reached the first S phase (at which time flagella are resorbed in <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>preparatory to division), confirming that death occurred during G1. This cell death during G1 is consistent with increased chromosome loss during mitosis, which should result in death during growth as essential gene products become depleted. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the cell death results from other defects in cell division.</p><p>In order to test whether supernumerary centrioles might cause the elevated cell death we observed, we asked whether the cell division defects in <italic>vfl2 </italic>correlated with the number of centrioles present. As previously shown, the fact that all centrioles are active as basal bodies in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants allows the number of centrioles to be inferred from the number of flagella [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>]. We therefore examined the outcome of cell divisions of cells having either the correct centriole copy number (n = 2), too few centrioles (n&#x0003c;2) or supernumerary centrioles (n&#x0003e;2). As indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref>, the fractions of inviable progeny were statistically similar for all three classes. We especially note that the cells with supernumerary centrioles did not show an increase in cell death after division.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>These results demonstrate that the <italic>vfl2-1 </italic>point mutation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>] in centrin leads to increased genomic instability via an increase in chromosome loss, suggesting that centrin plays a role in mitotic chromosome segregation. Formally, these results suggest that the gene encoding centrin could act as a \"housekeeper\" type tumor suppressor gene, which when mutated would predispose a cell to tumorigenesis indirectly by increasing genomic instability.</p><p>The mechanism by which the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutation leads to increased chromosome loss is unknown. The chromosome missegregation seen in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>centrin mutant is reminiscent of the Ipl (<underline>i</underline>ncrease in <underline>pl</underline>oidy) phenotype seen in yeast mutants defective in the yeast centrin homolog <italic>CDC31 </italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>], which is presumably due to a failure to form a mitotic spindle. By analogy with <italic>cdc31 </italic>mutants, it is then possible that the chromosome loss in <italic>vfl2 </italic>results from defective spindles. However, unlike in yeast where the spindle pole body is absolutely necessary to form a mitotic spindle, in higher eukaryotes it has been shown that bipolar spindles can self-assemble in the absence of centrioles or centrosomes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>]. Thus it was not obvious a priori that a defect in a centriole-associated protein (such as centrin) should have any effect on mitosis. Indeed, in the specific case of the <italic>Chlamydomonas vfl2 </italic>mutant, it has previously been reported that even though the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutation causes centrioles to detach from the spindle poles, the acentriolar spindles are nonetheless still bipolar [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. On this basis it was concluded by Wright and coworkers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>] that centrin does not play a role in mitosis. It might therefore seem surprising that we find an increase in chromosome loss in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant. However, while the ability of cells lacking centrioles or centrosomes to form bipolar spindles is well documented, and these spindles can be seen to undergo an apparently normal anaphase chromosome separation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>], the question of whether such acentriolar spindles might have an altered fidelity of chromosome segregation compared to normal spindles has never been directly addressed. We speculate that the chromosome missegregation we observe in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant reflects a decreased effectiveness of acentriolar spindles that self-assemble in this mutant. This would suggest a mitotic fidelity function for centrioles, which requires not merely the presence of centrioles in the cell, but also their specific localization at the spindle pole.</p><p>Alternatively, the chromosome loss we observe could be a byproduct of multipolar spindles. A small fraction (less than 1%) of <italic>vfl2 </italic>cells have three or more centrioles that could in theory give rise to tripolar or tetrapolar spindles. We suspect this is not the case because only bipolar spindles have been observed in these mutants [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Moreover, since centrioles are not located at spindle poles in this mutant, it is unlikely that the number of centrioles would have any effect on the number of spindle poles. The lack of centrioles at the poles also rules out configurations such as those seen during mitosis in multinucleate PtK1 cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], when multiple centriole pairs line up on either side of a single metaphase plate to form a masked multipolar spindle. Furthermore, to the extent that production of inviable cells during mitosis reflects chromosome loss, the data of Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref> argue against multipolar spindles playing a dominant role in chromosome loss since cells containing supernumerary centrioles do not show any increase in the rate of production of inviable progeny cells.</p><p>It is also possible that the chromosome loss in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants arises through a spindle-independent mechanism. Because centrin may be involved in nuclear transport [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], it is possible that the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutation could cause defects in chromosome organization due to a nuclear trafficking defect, leading indirectly to chromosome loss. We also note that disruption of centrin by RNAi in <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>has been reported to cause cytokinesis defects leading to binucleate cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>]. However such a cytokinesis defect cannot explain our results because the LOH assay we employed selects for loss of <italic>ACT2</italic>, rather than the presence of additional copies. Detailed cell-biological analysis of centrin mutant cells during division will be necessary to understand the basis of the chromosome loss we have observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found that a mutation in the centriole-associated protein centrin, which causes affected cells to form acentriolar spindles and lack centrin-based fibers, produces an increase in genomic instability caused by an increase in the rate of chromosome loss. These results indicate that either centrioles or the centrin protein itself are involved in increasing the fidelity of mitotic chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"methods\"><title>Methods</title><p>Heterozygous <italic>act2 </italic>diploid cells were constructed by crossing haploid strains of genotypes <italic>act2 arg7 mt- </italic>&#x000d7; <italic>ACT2 arg2 mt+</italic>.

Although the localization of centrioles within the centrosome together with their precise duplication prior to mitosis has suggested a role in bipolar spindle assembly or function, the actual role of centrioles in cell division remains unclear and controversial. Cells from which centrioles and centrosomes are ablated can still form bipolar spindles via a centrosome-independent self-organization process, but the effectiveness of such spindles in terms of chromosome segregation has not been carefully measured. Based on the circumstantial evidence that tumor cells which display genomic instability also frequently show aberrations in centriole structure or copy number [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>], it has been proposed that centrioles may participate in the maintenance of genomic stability. If centrioles play a role in chromosome segregation, then mutations in genes encoding centriolar proteins would be expected to result in genomic instability.</p><p>The EF-hand protein centrin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] is one of the few identified centriolar proteins. Centrin is found in all eukaryotes, and is localized to centrioles in vertebrate cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>], basal bodies in green algae [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>], and spindle pole bodies (SPBs) in yeast [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. Centrin is functionally required for centriole duplication [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>] and inheritance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. RNAi experiments in mammalian and algal cells have indicated that reduction of centrin can result in cell division arrest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>] and cytokinesis failure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>]. However, it is unclear if these defects are indirectly caused by abnormal centriole structure or copy number, or if instead they represent pleiotropic effects due to the direct participation of centrin in the cell division process. Centrin also appears to be involved in many other cellular processes, including flagellar excision [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], nuclear mRNA export [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>], cell membrane integrity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>] and homologous recombination [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. Consistent with these multiple roles, centrin localization is not restricted to centrioles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>], and centrin has been identified as a component of nuclear pores and flagellar dynein complexes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>]. Centrin is thus a versatile molecule that has been adapted to perform multiple diverse cellular functions. Given the fact that centrin localizes to centrioles, which are potentially involved in genome maintenance, together with the fact that centrin is functionally involved in centriole duplication and segregation, an obvious question is whether centrin plays a role in genomic stability. In this report we address this question using a centrin mutation in the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Genomic instability in the centrin mutant <italic>vfl2-1</italic></title><p>We tested whether centrin plays a role in genomic instability using a genetic assay for loss of heterozygosity in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>(<italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>refers to <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardti </italic>throughout) is a unicellular green alga with genetics similar to yeast, but which, unlike yeast, has centrioles (known as basal bodies) that are virtually identical to centrioles of vertebrate cells. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, centrin polymerizes into long fibers that link the centrioles/basal bodies to the nucleus. These fibers are called the nucleus basal body connectors (NBBCs) or rhizoplasts [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. The <italic>vfl2-1 </italic>mutant has a point mutation in the centrin gene [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>], and these mutants produce a reduced quantity of centrin protein that is unable to polymerize into a rhizoplast. The <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutation appears to result in a defect in centriole segregation, because mutant cells have a variable number of centrioles (between zero and six per cell). Despite their centriole number variation, these mutants are viable and form seemingly normal bipolar mitotic spindles. It has been argued on this basis that centrin-based rhizoplasts do not play a role in mitosis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Importantly, the centrioles in a <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant cell are not located at the spindle poles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], consistent with ultrastructural studies showing that, in green algae, centrioles are joined to the spindle poles by centrin-based fibers derived from the rhizoplast [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. The high viability of <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants thus allows us to measure genomic instability using genetic assays because populations of mutant cells can be grown for a sufficient number of generations to allow rare chromosome loss events to be detected.</p><p>We measured genomic instability in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants using a simple genetic assay for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) previously developed by Dutcher and coworkers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. This assay uses the <italic>act2 </italic>mutation, which confers recessive resistance to cycloheximide [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>]. The <italic>act2 </italic>heterozygous diploids are sensitive to cycloheximide, while homozygous or hemizygous <italic>act2 </italic>diploids are cycloheximide-resistant. When a diploid culture is plated on media containing cycloheximide, only cells that have lost the wild-type <italic>ACT2 </italic>allele can grow. By measuring the frequency with which such cells arise, the rate of chromosome loss can be calculated (see Methods). As illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>, using 48 independently constructed diploid lines each for wild type and <italic>vfl2</italic>, we found that the LOH rate per cell division increased from 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3 </sup>&#x000b1; 1.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>SEM (n = 48) in wild type, to 8.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3 </sup>&#x000b1; 5.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>SEM (n = 48) in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants. This difference is statistically significant (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.00005 based on one-tailed Welch's approximate <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>t </italic>= 12.2). The increase in loss of heterozygosity in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>centrin mutant relative to wild-type cells indicates that centrin plays a role in genomic stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic instability occurs via chromosome loss</title><p>In principle the LOH seen in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants could occur either by increased recombination or increased chromosome loss (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>). The latter would be consistent with a role for centrin or centrioles in mitotic spindle function, while an effect on recombination would suggest a spindle-independent role in DNA maintenance or chromosome dynamics. It is critical to distinguish these pathways because a role for centrin in DNA recombination and repair has been documented in plants [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. Given the close phylogenetic relation between green algae like <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>and green plants, the involvement of centrin in recombination in plants raises the real possibility that the loss of heterozygosity observed in <italic>vfl2 </italic>might have nothing to do with mitotic spindle function and might instead be driven by increased recombination.</p><p>In order to determine whether genomic instability in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant is caused by increased recombination or chromosome loss, we distinguished between the two pathways by analyzing the mating type (<italic>MT</italic>) locus, which is located on the opposite arm of the same chromosome from <italic>ACT2 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>). Diploid cells are heterozygous at <italic>MT </italic>and contain both the <italic>MT+ </italic>and <italic>MT- </italic>alleles. Because the <italic>ACT2 </italic>and <italic>MT </italic>loci are on opposite arms of the same chromosome, and recombination only causes LOH on a single arm distal to the crossover site, it can be inferred that only chromosome loss, and not mitotic recombination, could lead to the simultaneous loss of both the wild-type <italic>ACT2 </italic>gene and the <italic>MT+ </italic>allele (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>).</p><p>We therefore tested lines that had undergone LOH at the <italic>ACT2 </italic>locus for chromosome loss versus recombination, by analyzing the <italic>MT </italic>locus using PCR primers specific for the <italic>MT- </italic>and <italic>MT+ </italic>alleles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. As illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>, prior to selection on cycloheximide, all wild-type and <italic>vfl2/vfl2 </italic>diploid lines were indeed diploid, as judged by the fact that they were heterozygous at the <italic>MT </italic>locus and contained both <italic>MT+ </italic>and <italic>MT- </italic>alleles as expected for a diploid. In wild type, of 96 independently constructed diploid lines selected on cycloheximide, only two lines showed concomitant loss of the <italic>MT+ </italic>allele and, therefore, chromosome loss. In contrast, of 96 cycloheximide resistant <italic>vfl2 </italic>lines, we found that 27 had also lost the <italic>MT+ </italic>allele, loss of which indicated that the lines had undergone chromosome loss. These chromosome loss events apparently represent the loss of individual chromosomes rather than an overall return to haploidy, as the cells were able to grow on media lacking arginine and thus seemed to have retained the two homologs of the chromosome containing the <italic>arg2/arg7 </italic>mutations used to select for diploidy (see Methods). The difference in the proportion of LOH events due to chromosome loss (2/96 for wild type vs. 27/96 for <italic>vfl2</italic>) was highly significant (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.00001 based on Fisher's Exact Test). Multiplying the LOH rate by the fraction of LOH events due to chromosome loss, we found that the total rate of chromosome loss per cell division increased almost 100-fold, from 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>in wild type to 2.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3 </sup>in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell death during G1 in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants</title><p>The fact that <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants show increased chromosome loss in the genetic assay described above leads to the prediction that haploid <italic>vfl2 </italic>cells should frequently produce inviable progeny cells. This prediction follows from the fact that all <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>chromosomes contain essential genes, so a single chromosome loss event for any of the 17 chromosomes should produce an inviable progeny cell when haploid cell division are analyzed. (Note: chromosome loss did not lead to death in the experiments described above because those assays were conducted using diploid cells. Thus, chromosome loss led only to monosomy rather than nullisomy.) Consistent with this prediction, analysis of cell viability using the vital stain phenosaffranin indicated that <italic>vfl2 </italic>cultures contain a higher fraction of inviable cells than wild type (data not shown).</p><p>In order to test this prediction more quantitatively, we examined the outcomes of individual cell division events. Synchronized cultures of haploid <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>cells were embedded in agarose pads under a coverslip and imaged during G1 (as judged by time relative to the light-dark cycle and by the presence of flagella on most cells) by phase contrast microscopy as previously described [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>]. Viable cells were identified and their position marked, and then their progeny were examined during the first G1 phase after division. Only cells that divided successfully to give two or four progeny were scored (note that sometimes, depending on cell size at the commitment point, <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>cells can undergo two or three rapid division cycles during the dark phase of the circadian cycle). As a test of the methodology, we compared outcomes of division for wild-type cells and <italic>fla10-1 </italic>mutant cells grown at 21&#x000b0;C. The <italic>fla10-1 </italic>mutation occurs in a kinesin involved in flagellar assembly, and it has been reported that <italic>fla10-1 </italic>mutants show an increased rate of mitotic chromosome loss when grown at the permissive temperature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. If chromosome loss leads to increased production of inviable progeny, then this should be detectable in our analysis. Indeed, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref>, <italic>fla10-1 </italic>cells showed a significant increase in the fraction of divisions producing inviable progeny.</p><p>We then applied this method to <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant cells. As indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref>, we found that <italic>vfl2 </italic>showed a similar level of inviable progeny production as was observed in <italic>fla10 </italic>and significantly higher than in wild type. The cell death was observed during the first G1 after division and therefore did not result from a prolonged arrest or from a failure during subsequent S phase or mitosis. Dead cells were often roughly similar in size to their live siblings, suggesting that they were initially able to grow but eventually became inviable as they grew. In most cases the viable sibling cells retained flagella, indicating the culture had not yet reached the first S phase (at which time flagella are resorbed in <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>preparatory to division), confirming that death occurred during G1. This cell death during G1 is consistent with increased chromosome loss during mitosis, which should result in death during growth as essential gene products become depleted. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the cell death results from other defects in cell division.</p><p>In order to test whether supernumerary centrioles might cause the elevated cell death we observed, we asked whether the cell division defects in <italic>vfl2 </italic>correlated with the number of centrioles present. As previously shown, the fact that all centrioles are active as basal bodies in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants allows the number of centrioles to be inferred from the number of flagella [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>]. We therefore examined the outcome of cell divisions of cells having either the correct centriole copy number (n = 2), too few centrioles (n&#x0003c;2) or supernumerary centrioles (n&#x0003e;2). As indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref>, the fractions of inviable progeny were statistically similar for all three classes. We especially note that the cells with supernumerary centrioles did not show an increase in cell death after division.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>These results demonstrate that the <italic>vfl2-1 </italic>point mutation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>] in centrin leads to increased genomic instability via an increase in chromosome loss, suggesting that centrin plays a role in mitotic chromosome segregation. Formally, these results suggest that the gene encoding centrin could act as a \"housekeeper\" type tumor suppressor gene, which when mutated would predispose a cell to tumorigenesis indirectly by increasing genomic instability.</p><p>The mechanism by which the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutation leads to increased chromosome loss is unknown. The chromosome missegregation seen in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>centrin mutant is reminiscent of the Ipl (<underline>i</underline>ncrease in <underline>pl</underline>oidy) phenotype seen in yeast mutants defective in the yeast centrin homolog <italic>CDC31 </italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>], which is presumably due to a failure to form a mitotic spindle. By analogy with <italic>cdc31 </italic>mutants, it is then possible that the chromosome loss in <italic>vfl2 </italic>results from defective spindles. However, unlike in yeast where the spindle pole body is absolutely necessary to form a mitotic spindle, in higher eukaryotes it has been shown that bipolar spindles can self-assemble in the absence of centrioles or centrosomes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>]. Thus it was not obvious a priori that a defect in a centriole-associated protein (such as centrin) should have any effect on mitosis. Indeed, in the specific case of the <italic>Chlamydomonas vfl2 </italic>mutant, it has previously been reported that even though the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutation causes centrioles to detach from the spindle poles, the acentriolar spindles are nonetheless still bipolar [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. On this basis it was concluded by Wright and coworkers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>] that centrin does not play a role in mitosis. It might therefore seem surprising that we find an increase in chromosome loss in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant. However, while the ability of cells lacking centrioles or centrosomes to form bipolar spindles is well documented, and these spindles can be seen to undergo an apparently normal anaphase chromosome separation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>], the question of whether such acentriolar spindles might have an altered fidelity of chromosome segregation compared to normal spindles has never been directly addressed. We speculate that the chromosome missegregation we observe in the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutant reflects a decreased effectiveness of acentriolar spindles that self-assemble in this mutant. This would suggest a mitotic fidelity function for centrioles, which requires not merely the presence of centrioles in the cell, but also their specific localization at the spindle pole.</p><p>Alternatively, the chromosome loss we observe could be a byproduct of multipolar spindles. A small fraction (less than 1%) of <italic>vfl2 </italic>cells have three or more centrioles that could in theory give rise to tripolar or tetrapolar spindles. We suspect this is not the case because only bipolar spindles have been observed in these mutants [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Moreover, since centrioles are not located at spindle poles in this mutant, it is unlikely that the number of centrioles would have any effect on the number of spindle poles. The lack of centrioles at the poles also rules out configurations such as those seen during mitosis in multinucleate PtK1 cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], when multiple centriole pairs line up on either side of a single metaphase plate to form a masked multipolar spindle. Furthermore, to the extent that production of inviable cells during mitosis reflects chromosome loss, the data of Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref> argue against multipolar spindles playing a dominant role in chromosome loss since cells containing supernumerary centrioles do not show any increase in the rate of production of inviable progeny cells.</p><p>It is also possible that the chromosome loss in <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutants arises through a spindle-independent mechanism. Because centrin may be involved in nuclear transport [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], it is possible that the <italic>vfl2 </italic>mutation could cause defects in chromosome organization due to a nuclear trafficking defect, leading indirectly to chromosome loss. We also note that disruption of centrin by RNAi in <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>has been reported to cause cytokinesis defects leading to binucleate cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>]. However such a cytokinesis defect cannot explain our results because the LOH assay we employed selects for loss of <italic>ACT2</italic>, rather than the presence of additional copies. Detailed cell-biological analysis of centrin mutant cells during division will be necessary to understand the basis of the chromosome loss we have observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found that a mutation in the centriole-associated protein centrin, which causes affected cells to form acentriolar spindles and lack centrin-based fibers, produces an increase in genomic instability caused by an increase in the rate of chromosome loss. These results indicate that either centrioles or the centrin protein itself are involved in increasing the fidelity of mitotic chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"methods\"><title>Methods</title><p>Heterozygous <italic>act2 </italic>diploid cells were constructed by crossing haploid strains of genotypes <italic>act2 arg7 mt- </italic>&#x000d7; <italic>ACT2 arg2 mt+</italic>.
