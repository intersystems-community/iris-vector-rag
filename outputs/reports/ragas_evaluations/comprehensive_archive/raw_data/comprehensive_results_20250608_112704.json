          "Document(page_content='Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Document(page_content='Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Document(page_content='Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

          "Document(page_content='The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable.', metadata={}, id='1154')"

A retrospective descriptive study spanning nine years, from January 2014 to January 2022, was conducted at the Department of Pathology within a tertiary care hospital in South India. The study focused on analyzing the clinical presentation, prenatal ultrasonogram, and morphological features of fetuses with the ADAM complex, limb body wall complex, or amniotic bands. Among the 438 fetuses assessed during the study period, five fetuses showed features of the ADAM complex (0.01%).

          "Document(page_content='Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

          "Document(page_content='Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

          "Document(page_content='The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable.', metadata={}, id='1154')"

A retrospective descriptive study spanning nine years, from January 2014 to January 2022, was conducted at the Department of Pathology within a tertiary care hospital in South India. The study focused on analyzing the clinical presentation, prenatal ultrasonogram, and morphological features of fetuses with the ADAM complex, limb body wall complex, or amniotic bands. Among the 438 fetuses assessed during the study period, five fetuses showed features of the ADAM complex (0.01%). The most frequent gestational age observed was 12\u201318 weeks and most fetuses were female. The common anomaly encountered was limb defects, followed by abdominal and cranial anomalies. The diagnosis of the ADAM complex relies primarily on fetal autopsy to differentiate it from similar conditions like anencephaly or body-stalk anomalies. The pathologist plays a crucial role in understanding the complexities of the ADAM complex. Advanced antenatal imaging and therapies offer potential for prevention through improved counseling.",
          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications.

Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications.

Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "To identify the occurrence of the amniotic deformity adhesions, mutilation (ADAM) complex and imperative role of fetal autopsy in diagnosing this condition. A retrospective descriptive study spanning nine years, from January 2014 to January 2022, was conducted at the Department of Pathology within a tertiary care hospital in South India. The study focused on analyzing the clinical presentation, prenatal ultrasonogram, and morphological features of fetuses with the ADAM complex, limb body wall complex, or amniotic bands. Among the 438 fetuses assessed during the study period, five fetuses showed features of the ADAM complex (0.01%). The most frequent gestational age observed was 12\u201318 weeks and most fetuses were female. The common anomaly encountered was limb defects, followed by abdominal and cranial anomalies. The diagnosis of the ADAM complex relies primarily on fetal autopsy to differentiate it from similar conditions like anencephaly or body-stalk anomalies. The pathologist plays a crucial role in understanding the complexities of the ADAM complex. Advanced antenatal imaging and therapies offer potential for prevention through improved counseling.",
          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms.

Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls.

        "answer": "The mechanisms of antibiotic resistance involve several different processes that bacteria can use to evade the effects of antibiotics. These mechanisms include:\n\n1. **Mutation**: Bacteria can acquire mutations in their DNA that allow them to survive in the presence of antibiotics. These mutations can affect the target of the antibiotic, making it less effective, or they can activate alternative pathways that bypass the antibiotic's mechanism of action.\n\n2. **Horizontal gene transfer**: Bacteria can also acquire antibiotic resistance genes from other bacteria through horizontal gene transfer. This can occur through processes such as conjugation, transformation, or transduction, allowing bacteria to quickly spread antibiotic resistance genes throughout a population.\n\n3. **Efflux pumps**: Bacteria can also develop efflux pumps that actively pump antibiotics out of the cell before they can exert their effects. This mechanism allows bacteria to maintain low intracellular concentrations of antibiotics, reducing their effectiveness.\n\n4. **Biofilm formation**: Some bacteria can form biofilms, which are protective structures that allow them to withstand high concentrations of antibiotics. Biofilms provide a physical barrier that prevents antibiotics from reaching the bacteria, making them less susceptible to treatment.\n\n5. **Enzymatic inactivation**: Bacteria can produce enzymes that modify or degrade antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. For example, beta-lactamase enzymes can break down beta-lactam antibiotics like penicillin, preventing them from inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.\n\nIt is important to note that the information provided in the documents does not directly address the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

          "Document(page_content='Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

The mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists involves binding to and activating the GLP-1 receptor, which is found on various cells in the body including pancreatic beta cells.

The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Glucocorticoids achieve this by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm of target cells, leading to the activation of anti-inflammatory genes and the repression of pro-inflammatory genes. This results in decreased inflammation and the resolution of the inflammatory process.\n\nUnfortunately, the provided documents do not contain specific information related to how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing.

        "answer": "The provided documents do not directly address how biologics treat rheumatoid arthritis. Based on broader search results, biologics are a type of medication that specifically target components of the immune system involved in the inflammation process in rheumatoid arthritis. Biologics work by blocking specific cytokines or other proteins that play a role in the inflammatory response, thereby reducing inflammation and slowing the progression of the disease. These medications are usually prescribed for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have not responded well to traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Biologics are administered through injections or infusions and can help improve symptoms, reduce joint damage, and increase overall quality of life for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. It is important to note that biologics may have potential side effects and risks, so they are typically prescribed and monitored by healthcare professionals experienced in managing rheumatoid arthritis.",

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls.

The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls.

The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites.

Therefore, based on broader search results and general knowledge, the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance include:\n\n1. Genetic mutations: Bacteria can acquire genetic mutations that make them resistant to antibiotics. These mutations can occur spontaneously or through the transfer of resistance genes between bacteria.\n\n2. Horizontal gene transfer: Bacteria can transfer genetic material containing antibiotic resistance genes to other bacteria through mechanisms such as conjugation, transformation, and transduction.\n\n3. Efflux pumps: Some bacteria have efflux pumps that actively pump out antibiotics from inside the cell, reducing their effectiveness.\n\n4. Enzymatic inactivation: Some bacteria produce enzymes that can modify or degrade antibiotics, rendering them ineffective.\n\n5. Alteration of target sites: Bacteria can modify the target sites of antibiotics, preventing the drugs from binding effectively and inhibiting their action.\n\n6. Biofilm formation: Bacteria within biofilms are often more resistant to antibiotics due to the physical barrier of the biofilm and the presence of persister cells that are not actively dividing.\n\nThese mechanisms of antibiotic resistance contribute to the ability of bacteria to survive and proliferate in the presence of antibiotics, posing a significant challenge in the treatment of bacterial infections.",

Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment.

Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is deficient in Parkinson's disease. Once levodopa crosses the blood-brain barrier, it is converted to dopamine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. This increase in dopamine levels helps alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement.\n\nUnfortunately, the provided documents did not contain specific information related to the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease.",

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport.

We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication. If the individual may be identifiable, the author(s) has included a statement of release or other written form of approval from the patient(s) with this submission for publication.', metadata={'similarity_score': -0.03363723307847977, 'retrieval_method': 'colbert_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC11752538_gen_189')",
          "Document(page_content='The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable.', metadata={'similarity_score': -0.03363723307847977, 'retrieval_method': 'colbert_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC11752541_gen_188')"

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls.

The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

The study focused on analyzing the clinical presentation, prenatal ultrasonogram, and morphological features of fetuses with the ADAM complex, limb body wall complex, or amniotic bands. Among the 438 fetuses assessed during the study period, five fetuses showed features of the ADAM complex (0.01%).

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications.

Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

Qualitative analysis was performed by the review committee with the expert-adapted and expert-synthesized translation of the Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment scale into Portuguese, and the content validity index was calculated. Agreement was achieved between the translations of the Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment scale into Brazilian. Conceptual, idiomatic, semantic and experimental equivalences between the original and translated versions were obtained, resulting in the Brazilian version of the instrument, called the\n Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o F\u00edsica em Cuidados Intensivos Chelsea A version of the Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment scale can be reliably used in Brazil for functional assessment following its translation and cross-cultural adaptation to Brazilian Portuguese and shows evidence of excellent interrater reliability.",

Hemolytic anemia is rarely seen in vitamin B12 deficiency. This case report highlights a patient with a history of autoimmune thyroid disease who presented with severe hemolytic anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency from pernicious anemia. This report discusses the association of hemolytic anemia with vitamin B12 deficiency, the association of pernicious anemia with other autoimmune diseases, and the treatment of pernicious anemia.",
          "To identify the occurrence of the amniotic deformity adhesions, mutilation (ADAM) complex and imperative role of fetal autopsy in diagnosing this condition. A retrospective descriptive study spanning nine years, from January 2014 to January 2022, was conducted at the Department of Pathology within a tertiary care hospital in South India. The study focused on analyzing the clinical presentation, prenatal ultrasonogram, and morphological features of fetuses with the ADAM complex, limb body wall complex, or amniotic bands. Among the 438 fetuses assessed during the study period, five fetuses showed features of the ADAM complex (0.01%). The most frequent gestational age observed was 12\u201318 weeks and most fetuses were female. The common anomaly encountered was limb defects, followed by abdominal and cranial anomalies. The diagnosis of the ADAM complex relies primarily on fetal autopsy to differentiate it from similar conditions like anencephaly or body-stalk anomalies. The pathologist plays a crucial role in understanding the complexities of the ADAM complex. Advanced antenatal imaging and therapies offer potential for prevention through improved counseling.",
          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."
