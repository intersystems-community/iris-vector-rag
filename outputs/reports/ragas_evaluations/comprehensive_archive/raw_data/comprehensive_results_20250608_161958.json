          "To identify the occurrence of the amniotic deformity adhesions, mutilation (ADAM) complex and imperative role of fetal autopsy in diagnosing this condition. A retrospective descriptive study spanning nine years, from January 2014 to January 2022, was conducted at the Department of Pathology within a tertiary care hospital in South India. The study focused on analyzing the clinical presentation, prenatal ultrasonogram, and morphological features of fetuses with the ADAM complex, limb body wall complex, or amniotic bands. Among the 438 fetuses assessed during the study period, five fetuses showed features of the ADAM complex (0.01%). The most frequent gestational age observed was 12\u201318 weeks and most fetuses were female. The common anomaly encountered was limb defects, followed by abdominal and cranial anomalies. The diagnosis of the ADAM complex relies primarily on fetal autopsy to differentiate it from similar conditions like anencephaly or body-stalk anomalies. The pathologist plays a crucial role in understanding the complexities of the ADAM complex. Advanced antenatal imaging and therapies offer potential for prevention through improved counseling.",
          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication. If the individual may be identifiable, the author(s) has included a statement of release or other written form of approval from the patient(s) with this submission for publication.",
          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

          "After traumatic brain injury (TBI), ischemia and hypoxia of brain tissue, glucose undergoes anaerobic fermentation, leading to a large accumulation of lactic acid. Our aim was to explore the role of lactate metabolism in brain cells after TBI. In scRNA\u2010seq dataset, 10\u2010week\u2010old male C57BL/6 J mice were randomized to undergo mild fluid percussion injury or sham surgery, and we analyzed frontal cortex tissue during the acute (24\u00a0h) and subacute (7 days) phases of TBI at single\u2010cell resolution. Cell cycle phases were evaluated, and principal component analysis was performed. Cell populations were identified and visualized using the UMAP downscaling technique. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the \u201cFindAllMarkers\u201d algorithm. In addition, the set of genes related to lactate metabolism was evaluated using the AUCell score. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the functional pathways of DEGs in astrocytes in the acute and subacute phases of TBI. A total of 13 cell populations were distinguished, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitors. The number of neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells was reduced in the TBI group compared with the sham group. During the acute phase of TBI, enhanced interactions between brain\u2010associated cells, especially astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, were observed. Several signaling pathways, including EGF, CSF, MIF inflammatory factors as well as PSAP and PTN neurotrophic factor signaling were significantly enhanced after TBI. Lactate metabolism scores were elevated in the TBI group, especially in astrocytes. During the subacute phase, the frequency of intercellular communication increased but its intensity decreased. Astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells remained at high levels during both phases. PSAP signaling was closely associated with the subacute phase of TBI. Subsequently, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B9 ( Ndufb9 c Cox8a Ndufb9 Cox8a Lactate metabolism genes play an important role in TBI.

          "Axillary management of patients with early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) has evolved, especially with the implementation of precision radiotherapy techniques that have resulted in a significant reduction in treatment-related toxicities, but it is unclear whether post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) improves survival outcomes in breast cancer with lymph nodes micrometastases (BCLNMM, that is T0, T1 ~2NmiM0). Our study is to systematically evaluate the effect of PMRT on survival in breast cancer with lymph nodes micrometastases.

          "Kimura\u2019s disease is a rare, chronic inflammatory condition with a high recurrence rate, primarily affecting young to middle-aged Asian males. It typically manifests as masses in the head and neck, accompanied with regional lymphadenopathy. This report describes the case of a 50-year-old man initially diagnosed with Kimura\u2019s disease 13 years ago, following surgical removal of a left submandibular mass. Subsequent recurrences involved the parotid and contralateral submandibular regions, requiring radiotherapy and intermittent oral prednisone therapy. After 6 years, he developed progressive proptosis and visual impairment, revealing multiple orbital masses bilaterally. A puncture examination of the left submandibular mass was indicative of Kimura\u2019s disease. Throughout the follow-up period, the eosinophil levels correlated with prednisone use. This case highlights the disease\u2019s capacity for multisite recurrence within the head and neck over an extended duration. The extensive orbital involvement without renal manifestations is a rare presentation. Long-term follow-up is crucial in Kimura\u2019s disease management, and oral prednisone can effectively control disease progression.",
          "It has been reported that various physiological and psychological changes occur after consuming delicious food. Additionally, research on task performance efficiency following the consumption of delicious food has garnered significant attention. In particular, studies on physiological states have been actively conducted in recent years, with an increasing number of studies utilizing brain activity measurements. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the physiological changes that occur after consuming delicious food by administering a cognitive task, the Stroop task, and measuring brain activity during the task. In this study, two experiments were conducted to better understand the effects of consuming delicious food. Before starting the two experiments, we evaluated the taste of fried rice in a preliminary experiment and selected three types of them (delicious, slightly delicious, and normal) for the main experiment. In Experiment 1, 20 healthy students (19\u201326\u202fyears old, 11 females) were divided into two groups: 10 students in group 1 ate delicious fried rice and 10 students in group 2 ate normal fried rice. One experimental block included recording the EEG, performing the Stroop task, eating the given sample, and answering the questionnaire. Results of data analysis indicated that group 1 was significantly shorter (high work efficiency) than group 2 in terms of task work time. Concerning brain activity, group 1 showed lower theta and alpha amplitudes in the frontal regions (high arousal), and alpha band activity was lower in the left frontal region than in the right region (high approach motivation). In Experiment 2, 28 healthy students were asked to eat delicious fried rice and slightly delicious fried rice on different days. The daily experimental flow was set up as in Experiment 1. Results of data analysis showed that deliciousness and EEG were negatively correlated at theta and alpha band. This study provides novel evidence that eating delicious food increases work efficiency, arousal, and motivation for the task and decreases theta and alpha activities in limited brain regions. The observed neural profiles may enhance attentional states in high-demand occupational settings, while providing preliminary insights into neurophysiological mechanisms that might underlie food-related motivational processes.",

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

Cell cycle phases were evaluated, and principal component analysis was performed. Cell populations were identified and visualized using the UMAP downscaling technique. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the \u201cFindAllMarkers\u201d algorithm. In addition, the set of genes related to lactate metabolism was evaluated using the AUCell score. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the functional pathways of DEGs in astrocytes in the acute and subacute phases of TBI. A total of 13 cell populations were distinguished, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitors. The number of neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells was reduced in the TBI group compared with the sham group. During the acute phase of TBI, enhanced interactions between brain\u2010associated cells, especially astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, were observed. Several signaling pathways, including EGF, CSF, MIF inflammatory factors as well as PSAP and PTN neurotrophic factor signaling were significantly enhanced after TBI. Lactate metabolism scores were elevated in the TBI group, especially in astrocytes. During the subacute phase, the frequency of intercellular communication increased but its intensity decreased. Astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells remained at high levels during both phases. PSAP signaling was closely associated with the subacute phase of TBI.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

          "After traumatic brain injury (TBI), ischemia and hypoxia of brain tissue, glucose undergoes anaerobic fermentation, leading to a large accumulation of lactic acid. Our aim was to explore the role of lactate metabolism in brain cells after TBI. In scRNA\u2010seq dataset, 10\u2010week\u2010old male C57BL/6 J mice were randomized to undergo mild fluid percussion injury or sham surgery, and we analyzed frontal cortex tissue during the acute (24\u00a0h) and subacute (7 days) phases of TBI at single\u2010cell resolution. Cell cycle phases were evaluated, and principal component analysis was performed. Cell populations were identified and visualized using the UMAP downscaling technique. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the \u201cFindAllMarkers\u201d algorithm. In addition, the set of genes related to lactate metabolism was evaluated using the AUCell score. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the functional pathways of DEGs in astrocytes in the acute and subacute phases of TBI. A total of 13 cell populations were distinguished, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitors. The number of neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells was reduced in the TBI group compared with the sham group. During the acute phase of TBI, enhanced interactions between brain\u2010associated cells, especially astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, were observed. Several signaling pathways, including EGF, CSF, MIF inflammatory factors as well as PSAP and PTN neurotrophic factor signaling were significantly enhanced after TBI. Lactate metabolism scores were elevated in the TBI group, especially in astrocytes. During the subacute phase, the frequency of intercellular communication increased but its intensity decreased. Astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells remained at high levels during both phases. PSAP signaling was closely associated with the subacute phase of TBI. Subsequently, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B9 ( Ndufb9 c Cox8a Ndufb9 Cox8a Lactate metabolism genes play an important role in TBI.

          "Kimura\u2019s disease is a rare, chronic inflammatory condition with a high recurrence rate, primarily affecting young to middle-aged Asian males. It typically manifests as masses in the head and neck, accompanied with regional lymphadenopathy. This report describes the case of a 50-year-old man initially diagnosed with Kimura\u2019s disease 13 years ago, following surgical removal of a left submandibular mass. Subsequent recurrences involved the parotid and contralateral submandibular regions, requiring radiotherapy and intermittent oral prednisone therapy. After 6 years, he developed progressive proptosis and visual impairment, revealing multiple orbital masses bilaterally. A puncture examination of the left submandibular mass was indicative of Kimura\u2019s disease. Throughout the follow-up period, the eosinophil levels correlated with prednisone use. This case highlights the disease\u2019s capacity for multisite recurrence within the head and neck over an extended duration. The extensive orbital involvement without renal manifestations is a rare presentation. Long-term follow-up is crucial in Kimura\u2019s disease management, and oral prednisone can effectively control disease progression.",
          "It has been reported that various physiological and psychological changes occur after consuming delicious food. Additionally, research on task performance efficiency following the consumption of delicious food has garnered significant attention. In particular, studies on physiological states have been actively conducted in recent years, with an increasing number of studies utilizing brain activity measurements. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the physiological changes that occur after consuming delicious food by administering a cognitive task, the Stroop task, and measuring brain activity during the task. In this study, two experiments were conducted to better understand the effects of consuming delicious food. Before starting the two experiments, we evaluated the taste of fried rice in a preliminary experiment and selected three types of them (delicious, slightly delicious, and normal) for the main experiment. In Experiment 1, 20 healthy students (19\u201326\u202fyears old, 11 females) were divided into two groups: 10 students in group 1 ate delicious fried rice and 10 students in group 2 ate normal fried rice. One experimental block included recording the EEG, performing the Stroop task, eating the given sample, and answering the questionnaire. Results of data analysis indicated that group 1 was significantly shorter (high work efficiency) than group 2 in terms of task work time. Concerning brain activity, group 1 showed lower theta and alpha amplitudes in the frontal regions (high arousal), and alpha band activity was lower in the left frontal region than in the right region (high approach motivation). In Experiment 2, 28 healthy students were asked to eat delicious fried rice and slightly delicious fried rice on different days. The daily experimental flow was set up as in Experiment 1. Results of data analysis showed that deliciousness and EEG were negatively correlated at theta and alpha band. This study provides novel evidence that eating delicious food increases work efficiency, arousal, and motivation for the task and decreases theta and alpha activities in limited brain regions. The observed neural profiles may enhance attentional states in high-demand occupational settings, while providing preliminary insights into neurophysiological mechanisms that might underlie food-related motivational processes.",

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

          "After traumatic brain injury (TBI), ischemia and hypoxia of brain tissue, glucose undergoes anaerobic fermentation, leading to a large accumulation of lactic acid. Our aim was to explore the role of lactate metabolism in brain cells after TBI. In scRNA\u2010seq dataset, 10\u2010week\u2010old male C57BL/6 J mice were randomized to undergo mild fluid percussion injury or sham surgery, and we analyzed frontal cortex tissue during the acute (24\u00a0h) and subacute (7 days) phases of TBI at single\u2010cell resolution. Cell cycle phases were evaluated, and principal component analysis was performed. Cell populations were identified and visualized using the UMAP downscaling technique. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the \u201cFindAllMarkers\u201d algorithm. In addition, the set of genes related to lactate metabolism was evaluated using the AUCell score. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the functional pathways of DEGs in astrocytes in the acute and subacute phases of TBI. A total of 13 cell populations were distinguished, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitors. The number of neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells was reduced in the TBI group compared with the sham group. During the acute phase of TBI, enhanced interactions between brain\u2010associated cells, especially astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, were observed. Several signaling pathways, including EGF, CSF, MIF inflammatory factors as well as PSAP and PTN neurotrophic factor signaling were significantly enhanced after TBI. Lactate metabolism scores were elevated in the TBI group, especially in astrocytes. During the subacute phase, the frequency of intercellular communication increased but its intensity decreased. Astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells remained at high levels during both phases. PSAP signaling was closely associated with the subacute phase of TBI. Subsequently, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B9 ( Ndufb9 c Cox8a Ndufb9 Cox8a Lactate metabolism genes play an important role in TBI. These findings provide new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms following TBI.",

It typically manifests as masses in the head and neck, accompanied with regional lymphadenopathy. This report describes the case of a 50-year-old man initially diagnosed with Kimura\u2019s disease 13 years ago, following surgical removal of a left submandibular mass. Subsequent recurrences involved the parotid and contralateral submandibular regions, requiring radiotherapy and intermittent oral prednisone therapy. After 6 years, he developed progressive proptosis and visual impairment, revealing multiple orbital masses bilaterally. A puncture examination of the left submandibular mass was indicative of Kimura\u2019s disease. Throughout the follow-up period, the eosinophil levels correlated with prednisone use. This case highlights the disease\u2019s capacity for multisite recurrence within the head and neck over an extended duration. The extensive orbital involvement without renal manifestations is a rare presentation. Long-term follow-up is crucial in Kimura\u2019s disease management, and oral prednisone can effectively control disease progression.",
          "It has been reported that various physiological and psychological changes occur after consuming delicious food. Additionally, research on task performance efficiency following the consumption of delicious food has garnered significant attention. In particular, studies on physiological states have been actively conducted in recent years, with an increasing number of studies utilizing brain activity measurements. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the physiological changes that occur after consuming delicious food by administering a cognitive task, the Stroop task, and measuring brain activity during the task. In this study, two experiments were conducted to better understand the effects of consuming delicious food. Before starting the two experiments, we evaluated the taste of fried rice in a preliminary experiment and selected three types of them (delicious, slightly delicious, and normal) for the main experiment. In Experiment 1, 20 healthy students (19\u201326\u202fyears old, 11 females) were divided into two groups: 10 students in group 1 ate delicious fried rice and 10 students in group 2 ate normal fried rice. One experimental block included recording the EEG, performing the Stroop task, eating the given sample, and answering the questionnaire. Results of data analysis indicated that group 1 was significantly shorter (high work efficiency) than group 2 in terms of task work time. Concerning brain activity, group 1 showed lower theta and alpha amplitudes in the frontal regions (high arousal), and alpha band activity was lower in the left frontal region than in the right region (high approach motivation). In Experiment 2, 28 healthy students were asked to eat delicious fried rice and slightly delicious fried rice on different days. The daily experimental flow was set up as in Experiment 1. Results of data analysis showed that deliciousness and EEG were negatively correlated at theta and alpha band. This study provides novel evidence that eating delicious food increases work efficiency, arousal, and motivation for the task and decreases theta and alpha activities in limited brain regions. The observed neural profiles may enhance attentional states in high-demand occupational settings, while providing preliminary insights into neurophysiological mechanisms that might underlie food-related motivational processes.",

ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

        "answer": "GLP-1 receptor agonists are a class of medications commonly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These drugs work by mimicking the action of a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in the body. GLP-1 is a hormone that is released from the gut in response to food intake and helps to regulate blood sugar levels by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas and reducing the production of glucagon, another hormone that raises blood sugar levels.\n\nGLP-1 receptor agonists bind to and activate the GLP-1 receptors on pancreatic beta cells, leading to increased insulin secretion in response to elevated blood sugar levels. They also slow down the rate at which food is emptied from the stomach, which helps to reduce post-meal blood sugar spikes. Additionally, GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to suppress appetite and promote weight loss in some patients.\n\nIn conclusion, the mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists involves mimicking the action of the hormone GLP-1 to regulate blood sugar levels, increase insulin secretion, reduce glucagon production, slow down gastric emptying, suppress appetite, and promote weight loss.",

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the physiological changes that occur after consuming delicious food by administering a cognitive task, the Stroop task, and measuring brain activity during the task. In this study, two experiments were conducted to better understand the effects of consuming delicious food. Before starting the two experiments, we evaluated the taste of fried rice in a preliminary experiment and selected three types of them (delicious, slightly delicious, and normal) for the main experiment. In Experiment 1, 20 healthy students (19\u201326\\u202fyears old, 11 females) were divided into two groups: 10 students in group 1 ate delicious fried rice and 10 students in group 2 ate normal fried rice. One experimental block included recording the EEG, performing the Stroop task, eating the given sample, and answering the questionnaire. Results of data analysis indicated that group 1 was significantly shorter (high work efficiency) than group 2 in terms of task work time. Concerning brain activity, group 1 showed lower theta and alpha amplitudes in the frontal regions (high arousal), and alpha band activity was lower in the left frontal region than in the right region (high approach motivation). In Experiment 2, 28 healthy students were asked to eat delicious fried rice and slightly delicious fried rice on different days. The daily experimental flow was set up as in Experiment 1. Results of data analysis showed that deliciousness and EEG were negatively correlated at theta and alpha band. This study provides novel evidence that eating delicious food increases work efficiency, arousal, and motivation for the task and decreases theta and alpha activities in limited brain regions.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment.

Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today.

The documents discuss topics such as lactate metabolism after traumatic brain injury, axillary management of early-stage breast cancer, Kimura's disease, task performance efficiency after consuming delicious food, and treatments for type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it is uncertain and inconclusive to determine the role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure based on the information provided in these documents. \n\nTo provide a comprehensive answer, it is important to note that ACE inhibitors are commonly used in the management of heart failure. ACE inhibitors work by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which plays a role in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. By inhibiting this enzyme, ACE inhibitors help dilate blood vessels, reduce blood pressure, and decrease the workload on the heart. This can be beneficial in heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively.\n\nACE inhibitors are recommended in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) as they have been shown to improve symptoms, reduce hospitalizations, and prolong survival. They are often used in combination with other heart failure medications such as beta-blockers and diuretics. It is essential for individuals with heart failure to work closely with their healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan, which may include the use of ACE inhibitors.",

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the physiological changes that occur after consuming delicious food by administering a cognitive task, the Stroop task, and measuring brain activity during the task. In this study, two experiments were conducted to better understand the effects of consuming delicious food. Before starting the two experiments, we evaluated the taste of fried rice in a preliminary experiment and selected three types of them (delicious, slightly delicious, and normal) for the main experiment. In Experiment 1, 20 healthy students (19\u201326\\u202fyears old, 11 females) were divided into two groups: 10 students in group 1 ate delicious fried rice and 10 students in group 2 ate normal fried rice. One experimental block included recording the EEG, performing the Stroop task, eating the given sample, and answering the questionnaire. Results of data analysis indicated that group 1 was significantly shorter (high work efficiency) than group 2 in terms of task work time.

In Experiment 2, 28 healthy students were asked to eat delicious fried rice and slightly delicious fried rice on different days. The daily experimental flow was set up as in Experiment 1. Results of data analysis showed that deliciousness and EEG were negatively correlated at theta and alpha band. This study provides novel evidence that eating delicious food increases work efficiency, arousal, and motivation for the task and decreases theta and alpha activities in limited brain regions.

These mechanisms include:\n\n1. **Mutation**: Bacteria can develop mutations in their DNA that lead to changes in the target sites of antibiotics. This can prevent the antibiotic from binding to its target and exerting its effect, rendering the antibiotic ineffective.\n\n2. **Gene transfer**: Bacteria can acquire resistance genes from other bacteria through processes such as conjugation, transformation, and transduction. These resistance genes can encode enzymes that inactivate antibiotics, efflux pumps that expel antibiotics from the bacterial cell, or alter the target sites of antibiotics.\n\n3. **Biofilm formation**: Bacteria can form biofilms, which are protective structures that encase bacterial colonies. Biofilms can prevent antibiotics from reaching the bacteria, making them less susceptible to antibiotic treatment.\n\n4. **Efflux pumps**: Bacteria can possess efflux pumps that actively pump antibiotics out of the bacterial cell, reducing the concentration of the antibiotic inside the cell and decreasing its effectiveness.\n\n5. **Enzymatic inactivation**: Some bacteria produce enzymes that can inactivate antibiotics by modifying or degrading them. For example, beta-lactamase enzymes can break down beta-lactam antibiotics like penicillin.\n\nBased on the provided documents, the information on antibiotic resistance mechanisms is uncertain and incomplete.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

          "Document(page_content='Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today.

Additionally, research on task performance efficiency following the consumption of delicious food has garnered significant attention. In particular, studies on physiological states have been actively conducted in recent years, with an increasing number of studies utilizing brain activity measurements. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the physiological changes that occur after consuming delicious food by administering a cognitive task, the Stroop task, and measuring brain activity during the task. In this study, two experiments were conducted to better understand the effects of consuming delicious food. Before starting the two experiments, we evaluated the taste of fried rice in a preliminary experiment and selected three types of them (delicious, slightly delicious, and normal) for the main experiment. In Experiment 1, 20 healthy students (19\u201326\\u202fyears old, 11 females) were divided into two groups: 10 students in group 1 ate delicious fried rice and 10 students in group 2 ate normal fried rice. One experimental block included recording the EEG, performing the Stroop task, eating the given sample, and answering the questionnaire. Results of data analysis indicated that group 1 was significantly shorter (high work efficiency) than group 2 in terms of task work time. Concerning brain activity, group 1 showed lower theta and alpha amplitudes in the frontal regions (high arousal), and alpha band activity was lower in the left frontal region than in the right region (high approach motivation). In Experiment 2, 28 healthy students were asked to eat delicious fried rice and slightly delicious fried rice on different days. The daily experimental flow was set up as in Experiment 1. Results of data analysis showed that deliciousness and EEG were negatively correlated at theta and alpha band. This study provides novel evidence that eating delicious food increases work efficiency, arousal, and motivation for the task and decreases theta and alpha activities in limited brain regions. The observed neural profiles may enhance attentional states in high-demand occupational settings, while providing preliminary insights into neurophysiological mechanisms that might underlie food-related motivational processes.', metadata={'similarity_score': -0.020781926810741425, 'retrieval_method': 'colbert_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC1748704893')",

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

Additionally, research on task performance efficiency following the consumption of delicious food has garnered significant attention. In particular, studies on physiological states have been actively conducted in recent years, with an increasing number of studies utilizing brain activity measurements. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the physiological changes that occur after consuming delicious food by administering a cognitive task, the Stroop task, and measuring brain activity during the task. In this study, two experiments were conducted to better understand the effects of consuming delicious food. Before starting the two experiments, we evaluated the taste of fried rice in a preliminary experiment and selected three types of them (delicious, slightly delicious, and normal) for the main experiment. In Experiment 1, 20 healthy students (19\u201326\\u202fyears old, 11 females) were divided into two groups: 10 students in group 1 ate delicious fried rice and 10 students in group 2 ate normal fried rice. One experimental block included recording the EEG, performing the Stroop task, eating the given sample, and answering the questionnaire. Results of data analysis indicated that group 1 was significantly shorter (high work efficiency) than group 2 in terms of task work time. Concerning brain activity, group 1 showed lower theta and alpha amplitudes in the frontal regions (high arousal), and alpha band activity was lower in the left frontal region than in the right region (high approach motivation). In Experiment 2, 28 healthy students were asked to eat delicious fried rice and slightly delicious fried rice on different days. The daily experimental flow was set up as in Experiment 1. Results of data analysis showed that deliciousness and EEG were negatively correlated at theta and alpha band. This study provides novel evidence that eating delicious food increases work efficiency, arousal, and motivation for the task and decreases theta and alpha activities in limited brain regions. The observed neural profiles may enhance attentional states in high-demand occupational settings, while providing preliminary insights into neurophysiological mechanisms that might underlie food-related motivational processes.', metadata={'similarity_score': -0.03586516156792641, 'retrieval_method': 'colbert_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC1748704893')",

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

          "Document(page_content='Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Document(page_content='Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Document(page_content='Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

          "Document(page_content='The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Document(page_content='Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes.

          "Document(page_content='Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

          "Document(page_content='The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Document(page_content='Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment.

Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

          "Document(page_content='The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today.

The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications.

Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure.

          "After traumatic brain injury (TBI), ischemia and hypoxia of brain tissue, glucose undergoes anaerobic fermentation, leading to a large accumulation of lactic acid. Our aim was to explore the role of lactate metabolism in brain cells after TBI. In scRNA\u2010seq dataset, 10\u2010week\u2010old male C57BL/6 J mice were randomized to undergo mild fluid percussion injury or sham surgery, and we analyzed frontal cortex tissue during the acute (24\u00a0h) and subacute (7 days) phases of TBI at single\u2010cell resolution. Cell cycle phases were evaluated, and principal component analysis was performed. Cell populations were identified and visualized using the UMAP downscaling technique. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the \u201cFindAllMarkers\u201d algorithm. In addition, the set of genes related to lactate metabolism was evaluated using the AUCell score. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the functional pathways of DEGs in astrocytes in the acute and subacute phases of TBI. A total of 13 cell populations were distinguished, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitors. The number of neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells was reduced in the TBI group compared with the sham group. During the acute phase of TBI, enhanced interactions between brain\u2010associated cells, especially astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, were observed. Several signaling pathways, including EGF, CSF, MIF inflammatory factors as well as PSAP and PTN neurotrophic factor signaling were significantly enhanced after TBI. Lactate metabolism scores were elevated in the TBI group, especially in astrocytes. During the subacute phase, the frequency of intercellular communication increased but its intensity decreased. Astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells remained at high levels during both phases. PSAP signaling was closely associated with the subacute phase of TBI. Subsequently, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B9 ( Ndufb9 c Cox8a Ndufb9 Cox8a Lactate metabolism genes play an important role in TBI.

          "Kimura\u2019s disease is a rare, chronic inflammatory condition with a high recurrence rate, primarily affecting young to middle-aged Asian males. It typically manifests as masses in the head and neck, accompanied with regional lymphadenopathy. This report describes the case of a 50-year-old man initially diagnosed with Kimura\u2019s disease 13 years ago, following surgical removal of a left submandibular mass. Subsequent recurrences involved the parotid and contralateral submandibular regions, requiring radiotherapy and intermittent oral prednisone therapy. After 6 years, he developed progressive proptosis and visual impairment, revealing multiple orbital masses bilaterally. A puncture examination of the left submandibular mass was indicative of Kimura\u2019s disease. Throughout the follow-up period, the eosinophil levels correlated with prednisone use. This case highlights the disease\u2019s capacity for multisite recurrence within the head and neck over an extended duration. The extensive orbital involvement without renal manifestations is a rare presentation. Long-term follow-up is crucial in Kimura\u2019s disease management, and oral prednisone can effectively control disease progression.",
          "It has been reported that various physiological and psychological changes occur after consuming delicious food. Additionally, research on task performance efficiency following the consumption of delicious food has garnered significant attention. In particular, studies on physiological states have been actively conducted in recent years, with an increasing number of studies utilizing brain activity measurements. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the physiological changes that occur after consuming delicious food by administering a cognitive task, the Stroop task, and measuring brain activity during the task. In this study, two experiments were conducted to better understand the effects of consuming delicious food. Before starting the two experiments, we evaluated the taste of fried rice in a preliminary experiment and selected three types of them (delicious, slightly delicious, and normal) for the main experiment. In Experiment 1, 20 healthy students (19\u201326\u202fyears old, 11 females) were divided into two groups: 10 students in group 1 ate delicious fried rice and 10 students in group 2 ate normal fried rice. One experimental block included recording the EEG, performing the Stroop task, eating the given sample, and answering the questionnaire. Results of data analysis indicated that group 1 was significantly shorter (high work efficiency) than group 2 in terms of task work time. Concerning brain activity, group 1 showed lower theta and alpha amplitudes in the frontal regions (high arousal), and alpha band activity was lower in the left frontal region than in the right region (high approach motivation). In Experiment 2, 28 healthy students were asked to eat delicious fried rice and slightly delicious fried rice on different days. The daily experimental flow was set up as in Experiment 1. Results of data analysis showed that deliciousness and EEG were negatively correlated at theta and alpha band. This study provides novel evidence that eating delicious food increases work efficiency, arousal, and motivation for the task and decreases theta and alpha activities in limited brain regions. The observed neural profiles may enhance attentional states in high-demand occupational settings, while providing preliminary insights into neurophysiological mechanisms that might underlie food-related motivational processes.",

          "After traumatic brain injury (TBI), ischemia and hypoxia of brain tissue, glucose undergoes anaerobic fermentation, leading to a large accumulation of lactic acid. Our aim was to explore the role of lactate metabolism in brain cells after TBI. In scRNA\u2010seq dataset, 10\u2010week\u2010old male C57BL/6 J mice were randomized to undergo mild fluid percussion injury or sham surgery, and we analyzed frontal cortex tissue during the acute (24\u00a0h) and subacute (7 days) phases of TBI at single\u2010cell resolution. Cell cycle phases were evaluated, and principal component analysis was performed. Cell populations were identified and visualized using the UMAP downscaling technique. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the \u201cFindAllMarkers\u201d algorithm. In addition, the set of genes related to lactate metabolism was evaluated using the AUCell score. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the functional pathways of DEGs in astrocytes in the acute and subacute phases of TBI. A total of 13 cell populations were distinguished, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitors. The number of neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells was reduced in the TBI group compared with the sham group. During the acute phase of TBI, enhanced interactions between brain\u2010associated cells, especially astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, were observed. Several signaling pathways, including EGF, CSF, MIF inflammatory factors as well as PSAP and PTN neurotrophic factor signaling were significantly enhanced after TBI. Lactate metabolism scores were elevated in the TBI group, especially in astrocytes. During the subacute phase, the frequency of intercellular communication increased but its intensity decreased. Astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells remained at high levels during both phases. PSAP signaling was closely associated with the subacute phase of TBI. Subsequently, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B9 ( Ndufb9 c Cox8a Ndufb9 Cox8a Lactate metabolism genes play an important role in TBI. These findings provide new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms following TBI.",
          "Axillary management of patients with early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) has evolved, especially with the implementation of precision radiotherapy techniques that have resulted in a significant reduction in treatment-related toxicities, but it is unclear whether post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) improves survival outcomes in breast cancer with lymph nodes micrometastases (BCLNMM, that is T0, T1 ~2NmiM0). Our study is to systematically evaluate the effect of PMRT on survival in breast cancer with lymph nodes micrometastases. A literature search was performed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or retrospective studies related to PMRT versus non-post-mastectomy radiotherapy (non-PMRT) in the adjuvant treatment of ESBC in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI and other databases. R package  meta 10 relevant studies were screened, all of which were retrospective studies.

          "Kimura\u2019s disease is a rare, chronic inflammatory condition with a high recurrence rate, primarily affecting young to middle-aged Asian males. It typically manifests as masses in the head and neck, accompanied with regional lymphadenopathy. This report describes the case of a 50-year-old man initially diagnosed with Kimura\u2019s disease 13 years ago, following surgical removal of a left submandibular mass. Subsequent recurrences involved the parotid and contralateral submandibular regions, requiring radiotherapy and intermittent oral prednisone therapy. After 6 years, he developed progressive proptosis and visual impairment, revealing multiple orbital masses bilaterally. A puncture examination of the left submandibular mass was indicative of Kimura\u2019s disease. Throughout the follow-up period, the eosinophil levels correlated with prednisone use. This case highlights the disease\u2019s capacity for multisite recurrence within the head and neck over an extended duration. The extensive orbital involvement without renal manifestations is a rare presentation. Long-term follow-up is crucial in Kimura\u2019s disease management, and oral prednisone can effectively control disease progression.",
          "It has been reported that various physiological and psychological changes occur after consuming delicious food. Additionally, research on task performance efficiency following the consumption of delicious food has garnered significant attention. In particular, studies on physiological states have been actively conducted in recent years, with an increasing number of studies utilizing brain activity measurements. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the physiological changes that occur after consuming delicious food by administering a cognitive task, the Stroop task, and measuring brain activity during the task. In this study, two experiments were conducted to better understand the effects of consuming delicious food. Before starting the two experiments, we evaluated the taste of fried rice in a preliminary experiment and selected three types of them (delicious, slightly delicious, and normal) for the main experiment. In Experiment 1, 20 healthy students (19\u201326\u202fyears old, 11 females) were divided into two groups: 10 students in group 1 ate delicious fried rice and 10 students in group 2 ate normal fried rice. One experimental block included recording the EEG, performing the Stroop task, eating the given sample, and answering the questionnaire. Results of data analysis indicated that group 1 was significantly shorter (high work efficiency) than group 2 in terms of task work time. Concerning brain activity, group 1 showed lower theta and alpha amplitudes in the frontal regions (high arousal), and alpha band activity was lower in the left frontal region than in the right region (high approach motivation). In Experiment 2, 28 healthy students were asked to eat delicious fried rice and slightly delicious fried rice on different days. The daily experimental flow was set up as in Experiment 1. Results of data analysis showed that deliciousness and EEG were negatively correlated at theta and alpha band. This study provides novel evidence that eating delicious food increases work efficiency, arousal, and motivation for the task and decreases theta and alpha activities in limited brain regions. The observed neural profiles may enhance attentional states in high-demand occupational settings, while providing preliminary insights into neurophysiological mechanisms that might underlie food-related motivational processes.",

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

          "After traumatic brain injury (TBI), ischemia and hypoxia of brain tissue, glucose undergoes anaerobic fermentation, leading to a large accumulation of lactic acid. Our aim was to explore the role of lactate metabolism in brain cells after TBI. In scRNA\u2010seq dataset, 10\u2010week\u2010old male C57BL/6 J mice were randomized to undergo mild fluid percussion injury or sham surgery, and we analyzed frontal cortex tissue during the acute (24\u00a0h) and subacute (7 days) phases of TBI at single\u2010cell resolution. Cell cycle phases were evaluated, and principal component analysis was performed. Cell populations were identified and visualized using the UMAP downscaling technique. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the \u201cFindAllMarkers\u201d algorithm. In addition, the set of genes related to lactate metabolism was evaluated using the AUCell score. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the functional pathways of DEGs in astrocytes in the acute and subacute phases of TBI. A total of 13 cell populations were distinguished, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitors. The number of neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells was reduced in the TBI group compared with the sham group. During the acute phase of TBI, enhanced interactions between brain\u2010associated cells, especially astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, were observed. Several signaling pathways, including EGF, CSF, MIF inflammatory factors as well as PSAP and PTN neurotrophic factor signaling were significantly enhanced after TBI. Lactate metabolism scores were elevated in the TBI group, especially in astrocytes. During the subacute phase, the frequency of intercellular communication increased but its intensity decreased. Astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells remained at high levels during both phases. PSAP signaling was closely associated with the subacute phase of TBI.

          "Kimura\u2019s disease is a rare, chronic inflammatory condition with a high recurrence rate, primarily affecting young to middle-aged Asian males. It typically manifests as masses in the head and neck, accompanied with regional lymphadenopathy. This report describes the case of a 50-year-old man initially diagnosed with Kimura\u2019s disease 13 years ago, following surgical removal of a left submandibular mass. Subsequent recurrences involved the parotid and contralateral submandibular regions, requiring radiotherapy and intermittent oral prednisone therapy. After 6 years, he developed progressive proptosis and visual impairment, revealing multiple orbital masses bilaterally. A puncture examination of the left submandibular mass was indicative of Kimura\u2019s disease. Throughout the follow-up period, the eosinophil levels correlated with prednisone use. This case highlights the disease\u2019s capacity for multisite recurrence within the head and neck over an extended duration. The extensive orbital involvement without renal manifestations is a rare presentation. Long-term follow-up is crucial in Kimura\u2019s disease management, and oral prednisone can effectively control disease progression.",
          "It has been reported that various physiological and psychological changes occur after consuming delicious food. Additionally, research on task performance efficiency following the consumption of delicious food has garnered significant attention. In particular, studies on physiological states have been actively conducted in recent years, with an increasing number of studies utilizing brain activity measurements. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the physiological changes that occur after consuming delicious food by administering a cognitive task, the Stroop task, and measuring brain activity during the task. In this study, two experiments were conducted to better understand the effects of consuming delicious food. Before starting the two experiments, we evaluated the taste of fried rice in a preliminary experiment and selected three types of them (delicious, slightly delicious, and normal) for the main experiment. In Experiment 1, 20 healthy students (19\u201326\u202fyears old, 11 females) were divided into two groups: 10 students in group 1 ate delicious fried rice and 10 students in group 2 ate normal fried rice. One experimental block included recording the EEG, performing the Stroop task, eating the given sample, and answering the questionnaire. Results of data analysis indicated that group 1 was significantly shorter (high work efficiency) than group 2 in terms of task work time. Concerning brain activity, group 1 showed lower theta and alpha amplitudes in the frontal regions (high arousal), and alpha band activity was lower in the left frontal region than in the right region (high approach motivation). In Experiment 2, 28 healthy students were asked to eat delicious fried rice and slightly delicious fried rice on different days. The daily experimental flow was set up as in Experiment 1. Results of data analysis showed that deliciousness and EEG were negatively correlated at theta and alpha band. This study provides novel evidence that eating delicious food increases work efficiency, arousal, and motivation for the task and decreases theta and alpha activities in limited brain regions. The observed neural profiles may enhance attentional states in high-demand occupational settings, while providing preliminary insights into neurophysiological mechanisms that might underlie food-related motivational processes.",
