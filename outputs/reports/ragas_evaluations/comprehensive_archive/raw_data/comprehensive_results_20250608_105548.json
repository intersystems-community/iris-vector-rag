          "Document(page_content='Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Document(page_content='Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Document(page_content='Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

          "Document(page_content='The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable.', metadata={}, id='1154')"

Among the 438 fetuses assessed during the study period, five fetuses showed features of the ADAM complex (0.01%). The most frequent gestational age observed was 12\u201318 weeks and most fetuses were female. The common anomaly encountered was limb defects, followed by abdominal and cranial anomalies. The diagnosis of the ADAM complex relies primarily on fetal autopsy to differentiate it from similar conditions like anencephaly or body-stalk anomalies. The pathologist plays a crucial role in understanding the complexities of the ADAM complex. Advanced antenatal imaging and therapies offer potential for prevention through improved counseling.', metadata={}, id='1150')",
          "Document(page_content='Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Document(page_content='Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

          "Document(page_content='Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

          "Document(page_content='The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable.', metadata={}, id='1154')"

          "Document(page_content='The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable.', metadata={}, id='1154')"

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor.

        "answer": "The provided documents do not directly address the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. In general, antibiotic resistance can occur through several mechanisms. One common mechanism is the production of enzymes by bacteria that can inactivate antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. Another mechanism is the alteration of bacterial cell walls or membranes to prevent antibiotics from entering the cells. Bacteria can also develop efflux pumps that actively pump out antibiotics from the cell. Additionally, genetic mutations in bacteria can lead to changes in antibiotic targets, making the antibiotics unable to bind and exert their effects. The exchange of genetic material between bacteria through processes like conjugation, transformation, and transduction can also contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. It is important to note that the specific mechanisms of antibiotic resistance can vary depending on the type of antibiotic and the bacterial species involved.",

        "answer": "The mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease involves its conversion into dopamine in the brain. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, levodopa is converted into dopamine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is deficient in individuals with Parkinson's disease, leading to the characteristic movement symptoms of the condition. By increasing dopamine levels in the brain, levodopa helps to alleviate these symptoms and improve motor function in Parkinson's disease patients.\n\nIt is important to note that the information provided in the documents does not directly address the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls.

Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor.

        "answer": "Based on the provided documents, there is no direct information on how statins prevent cardiovascular disease. However, based on broader knowledge and research beyond the documents, statins are a class of medications commonly used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. High cholesterol is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes. \n\nStatins work by inhibiting an enzyme in the liver that is involved in the production of cholesterol. By reducing the amount of cholesterol produced in the liver, statins help lower overall cholesterol levels in the blood. This, in turn, can reduce the buildup of plaques in the arteries, which can lead to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.\n\nAdditionally, statins have been shown to have other beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, including reducing inflammation in the blood vessels and improving endothelial function. These actions can help prevent the development of atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.\n\nIn conclusion, statins prevent cardiovascular disease by lowering cholesterol levels in the blood, reducing inflammation in the blood vessels, and improving endothelial function. While this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents, it is a well-established mechanism of action for statins based on broader research and knowledge in the medical field.",

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls.

The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

These medications are typically administered via injection or infusion and can help reduce symptoms, slow down the progression of joint damage, and improve overall quality of life for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. Biologics are often used in combination with other medications such as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to effectively manage the condition.

The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls.

        "answer": "The provided documents do not directly address how statins prevent cardiovascular disease. However, based on broader search results, statins are a class of medications commonly prescribed to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. By reducing cholesterol levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, statins help prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries, known as atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes. Therefore, by lowering cholesterol levels and reducing plaque buildup, statins can decrease the risk of cardiovascular events and improve overall heart health. Additionally, statins have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may also contribute to their cardiovascular benefits. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized information on how statins can help prevent cardiovascular disease.",

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy.

Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites.

        "answer": "Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as by interfering with the signaling pathways involved in the inflammatory response. They also have immunosuppressive effects by reducing the activity of immune cells such as T cells and macrophages. Additionally, glucocorticoids can stabilize cell membranes and inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators from cells.\n\nUnfortunately, the provided documents do not contain specific information about how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation. Therefore, the answer is based on general knowledge of the pharmacological effects of glucocorticoids.",

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing.

However, based on general knowledge, antibiotic resistance can occur through several mechanisms. These include:\n\n1. Genetic mutations: Bacteria can acquire genetic mutations that allow them to survive the effects of antibiotics. These mutations can alter the structure of the target site of the antibiotic, prevent the antibiotic from entering the bacterial cell, or enhance the bacteria's ability to pump out the antibiotic.\n\n2. Horizontal gene transfer: Bacteria can also acquire resistance genes from other bacteria through mechanisms such as conjugation, transformation, and transduction. This allows for the rapid spread of resistance genes among bacterial populations.\n\n3. Antibiotic inactivation: Some bacteria produce enzymes that can inactivate antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. For example, beta-lactamase enzymes can break down beta-lactam antibiotics like penicillin.\n\n4. Efflux pumps: Bacteria can possess efflux pumps that actively pump antibiotics out of the cell, reducing their concentration inside the cell and limiting their effectiveness.\n\n5. Biofilm formation: Bacteria can form biofilms, which are complex structures that provide protection against antibiotics. Bacteria within biofilms are less susceptible to antibiotics due to reduced penetration of the drug.\n\nIt is important to note that antibiotic resistance is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive approach involving prudent antibiotic use, development of new antibiotics, and implementation of infection prevention and control measures.",

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

        "answer": "The mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease involves its conversion to dopamine in the brain. Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is deficient in Parkinson's disease. By increasing dopamine levels in the brain, levodopa helps to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Levodopa is often combined with carbidopa, a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, to prevent the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, allowing more levodopa to reach the brain and be converted to dopamine where it is needed. Levodopa is one of the mainstays of treatment for Parkinson's disease, although its long-term effectiveness can be limited by the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Additional treatments may be required as the disease progresses. \n\nUnfortunately, the provided documents do not contain specific information related to the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease.",

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment.

          "Document(page_content='Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Document(page_content='Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes.

          "Document(page_content='Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

          "Document(page_content='The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today.
