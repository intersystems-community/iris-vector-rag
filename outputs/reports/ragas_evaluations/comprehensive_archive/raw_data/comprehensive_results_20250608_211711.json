        "query": "What are the effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes?",
        "answer": "Metformin is a commonly used medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is often prescribed as a first-line treatment and works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity. Metformin is known to have beneficial effects beyond glycemic control, including cardiovascular and renal protection. In patients with T2DM, the use of metformin can help in reducing the occurrence of hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery, which is crucial in the perioperative setting. \n\nAdditionally, metformin has been shown to exert a neuroprotective role in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). In a study focusing on PD patients, the use of metformin as adjuvant therapy alongside levodopa/carbidopa showed trends in biomarker changes that suggest a potential impact on the underlying pathophysiology of PD. This highlights the potential neuroprotective effects of metformin in managing PD symptoms and disease progression.\n\nOverall, metformin plays a significant role in the management of T2DM by improving insulin sensitivity, lowering glucose production, and providing additional benefits such as cardiovascular and renal protection. Its potential neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative disorders like PD further demonstrate its diverse therapeutic benefits in different medical conditions.",

          "Document(page_content='Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery.

In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications.

Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement.

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \\n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.', metadata={}, id='2551')",

This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed.

          "Document(page_content='In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.', metadata={}, id='2759')",

Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \\n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.', metadata={}, id='2551')",

Document 1 highlights the expanded indications for SGLT2 inhibitors to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after 2020. The study analyzed prescription data in Japan and found that the total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed increased over the years, with a significant portion being prescribed to the elderly population. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors are being increasingly used in patients with kidney-related conditions.\n\nAdditionally, Document 10 discusses the use of kidney-specific biomarkers to evaluate acute kidney injury (AKI) after cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC). While this document focuses on AKI, it indirectly highlights the importance of monitoring kidney function in patients undergoing treatments that may impact renal health. The study found that certain biomarkers, such as urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and serum cystatin C, can be used to assess kidney function post-treatment.\n\nOverall, SGLT2 inhibitors play a role in improving kidney function, especially in conditions like heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Monitoring kidney-specific biomarkers can help in assessing the impact of these inhibitors and other treatments on renal health. Further research and monitoring are needed to fully understand the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function and to optimize their use in patients with kidney-related conditions.",

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

          "We report the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy with a history of recurrent and severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy with an uncommon clinical presentation. This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

          "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily for 3\u00a0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily and 500\u00a0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group). Patients were assessed via Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).

          "Introduction Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS), as similarities in pathophysiology exist between the two. Adipokines are the key molecules that alter the adipose tissue metabolism and distribution, leading to MetS. This study was conducted to assess the levels of adipokines among patients with PCOS with and without MetS and to establish the role of adipokines as an early predictor for the development of MetS in PCOS. Materials and methods In this monocentric, tertiary hospital-based study, 144 patients with PCOS were selected and classified according to Rotterdam criteria and screened for MetS. Patients were grouped into MetS and non-MetS categories based on the presence of MetS. Adipokine levels (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin) were measured and compared, along with other biochemical and anthropological parameters. Data were analyzed using Jamovi statistical software, version 2.3 (Retrieved from  https://www.jamovi.org Results Out of the 144 patients included in the study, 58 were diagnosed with MetS and grouped as MetS. The prevalence of MetS was maximum among the non-PCO\u00a0(O+HA) phenotype\u00a0(53 out of 58). Significant differences\u00a0(p<0.001) in adipokines were observed between the MetS and non-MetS groups. Adiponectin, leptin, and resistin were found to have a significant role as predictors of MetS at an early stage of development of the syndrome, along with other common predictors. However, in later stages, fasting, blood glucose, waist circumference, and triglycerides remain significant predictors. Conclusion The present study reports a high prevalence of MetS among PCOS cases (40.27%). Altered adipokine levels may be significantly associated with the early stages of MetS development and\u00a0may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the management of MetS in PCOS. Therefore, the measurement of adipokines during preliminary investigations may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the\u00a0management of MetS in PCOS.",

          "This study analyzes data from the 2009\u20132018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to explore the relationship between the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI), also referred to as the pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) among adults in the United States. Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4."

          "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",
          "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.",
          "Membranous nephropathy can lead to end-stage kidney disease, for which kidney transplantation is the preferred therapy. However, the disease often relapses, which can impact allograft survival. We conducted a prospective multicenter study in France involving 72 patients with membranous nephropathy who were awaiting and then underwent kidney transplantation. In addition, we established a retrospective validation cohort of 65 patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic significance of pretransplant anti phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) antibodies on the recurrence of membranous nephropathy. The study also assessed the incidence rate, time to onset, and risk factors for recurrence, as well as allograft outcome. The prospective cohort showed a 26% cumulative incidence of membranous nephropathy recurrence after a median follow-up of 23.5 months.

          "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of GST compared to insulin tolerance test (ITT) in the definition of GHD at adult height achievement. Ninety-seven subjects with childhood-onset GHD (median age, 17.39 years) underwent ITT, GST, and IGF-1 testing; 44 subjects were idiopathic (isolated GHD), 35 moderate organic GHD (0-2 hormone deficiencies) and 18 severe organic GHD (\u22653 hormone deficiencies). Bland and Altman analysis showed a high consistency of GH peak measures after ITT and GST. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified 7.3 \u03bcg/L as the optimal GH peak cutoff to GST [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.15-8.91; sensitivity 95.7%, specificity 88.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) 88.0%, negative predictive value (NPV) 95.7%] able to correctly classify 91.8% of the entire cohort while 5.8 \u03bcg/L was the best GH peak cutoff able to correctly classify 91.4% of moderate organic GHD patients (95% CI 3.16-7.39; sensitivity 96.0%, specificity 80.0%, PPV 92.3%, NPV 88.9%). Patients with \u22653 hormone deficiencies showed a GH peak <5 \u03bcg/L at ITT and <5.8 \u03bcg/L at GST but 1.

          "We report the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy with a history of recurrent and severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy with an uncommon clinical presentation. This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

          "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily for 3\u00a0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily and 500\u00a0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group).

          "Introduction Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS), as similarities in pathophysiology exist between the two. Adipokines are the key molecules that alter the adipose tissue metabolism and distribution, leading to MetS. This study was conducted to assess the levels of adipokines among patients with PCOS with and without MetS and to establish the role of adipokines as an early predictor for the development of MetS in PCOS. Materials and methods In this monocentric, tertiary hospital-based study, 144 patients with PCOS were selected and classified according to Rotterdam criteria and screened for MetS. Patients were grouped into MetS and non-MetS categories based on the presence of MetS. Adipokine levels (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin) were measured and compared, along with other biochemical and anthropological parameters. Data were analyzed using Jamovi statistical software, version 2.3 (Retrieved from  https://www.jamovi.org Results Out of the 144 patients included in the study, 58 were diagnosed with MetS and grouped as MetS. The prevalence of MetS was maximum among the non-PCO\u00a0(O+HA) phenotype\u00a0(53 out of 58). Significant differences\u00a0(p<0.001) in adipokines were observed between the MetS and non-MetS groups. Adiponectin, leptin, and resistin were found to have a significant role as predictors of MetS at an early stage of development of the syndrome, along with other common predictors. However, in later stages, fasting, blood glucose, waist circumference, and triglycerides remain significant predictors. Conclusion The present study reports a high prevalence of MetS among PCOS cases (40.27%). Altered adipokine levels may be significantly associated with the early stages of MetS development and\u00a0may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the management of MetS in PCOS. Therefore, the measurement of adipokines during preliminary investigations may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the\u00a0management of MetS in PCOS.",

          "This study analyzes data from the 2009\u20132018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to explore the relationship between the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI), also referred to as the pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) among adults in the United States. Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4."

This review analyzed 29 out of 1,986 studies, conducted between 2005 and 2022, with participants from multiple countries. Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with age and gender, while associations with hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria were inconsistent. In the meta-analyses, a correlation between serum Gd-IgA1 and estimated glomerular filtration rate was identified, however, the relationships between Gd-IgA1 levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage and progression to kidney failure were inconsistent. Serum Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with validated prognostic risk factors, but were negatively correlated with kidney function. Further research in larger studies using standardized assays are needed to establish the value of Gd-IgA1 as a prognostic risk factor in IgAN. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40620-023-01874-8.",
          "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity\u2013response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.",
          "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1- and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist tirzepatide (referred to here collectively as \u201cGLP-1-based therapy\u201d) are incretin-based therapies being used increasingly in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity. They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease.

          "Primary glomerular disease (PGD) is an idiopathic cause of renal glomerular lesions that is characterized by proteinuria or hematuria and is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

          "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical morbidity after cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC). This study was conducted to investigate the use of kidney-specific biomarkers to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of post-HIPEC AKI. Patients who received CRS/HIPEC were prospectively enrolled in this study. We serially sampled urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), serum cystatin C (sCyC), and \u03b22 microglobulin (s\u03b22-MG) on the day before CRS/HIPEC and then 2 h, 1 d, 2 d, 3 d, and 7 d after CRS/HIPEC. The primary outcome was the occurrence of AKI during the first 7 d. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were calculated to evaluate the detection performance. A total of 75 patients were eligible, of whom 5 (6.7%) fulfilled the criteria of AKI during the study period (AKI group) and 70 did not (non-AKI group). No significant differences were observed in these biomarkers between the two groups, except for s\u03b22-MG on day 3 ( P P P This is the first prospective study to evaluate the value of kidney-specific biomarkers in patients after CRS/HIPEC.

          "Membranous nephropathy can lead to end-stage kidney disease, for which kidney transplantation is the preferred therapy. However, the disease often relapses, which can impact allograft survival. We conducted a prospective multicenter study in France involving 72 patients with membranous nephropathy who were awaiting and then underwent kidney transplantation. In addition, we established a retrospective validation cohort of 65 patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic significance of pretransplant anti phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) antibodies on the recurrence of membranous nephropathy. The study also assessed the incidence rate, time to onset, and risk factors for recurrence, as well as allograft outcome. The prospective cohort showed a 26% cumulative incidence of membranous nephropathy recurrence after a median follow-up of 23.5 months. This was confirmed by a 28% cumulative incidence after a median follow-up of 67 months in the retrospective cohort. A strong association was found between the presence of anti-PLA2R1 antibodies prior to transplantation and the risk of disease recurrence (risk ratio\u00a0= 5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.3\u201315.7;  P The presence of anti-PLA2R1 antibodies prior to transplantation was a strong predictor of recurrence of allograft membranous nephropathy. An individualized immunomonitoring and management strategy for kidney transplant candidates with anti-PLA2R1-associated membranous nephropathy should be considered.",

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

          "This study analyzes data from the 2009\u20132018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to explore the relationship between the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI), also referred to as the pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) among adults in the United States. Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.",
          "Introduction Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS), as similarities in pathophysiology exist between the two. Adipokines are the key molecules that alter the adipose tissue metabolism and distribution, leading to MetS. This study was conducted to assess the levels of adipokines among patients with PCOS with and without MetS and to establish the role of adipokines as an early predictor for the development of MetS in PCOS. Materials and methods In this monocentric, tertiary hospital-based study, 144 patients with PCOS were selected and classified according to Rotterdam criteria and screened for MetS. Patients were grouped into MetS and non-MetS categories based on the presence of MetS. Adipokine levels (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin) were measured and compared, along with other biochemical and anthropological parameters. Data were analyzed using Jamovi statistical software, version 2.3 (Retrieved from  https://www.jamovi.org Results Out of the 144 patients included in the study, 58 were diagnosed with MetS and grouped as MetS. The prevalence of MetS was maximum among the non-PCO\u00a0(O+HA) phenotype\u00a0(53 out of 58). Significant differences\u00a0(p<0.001) in adipokines were observed between the MetS and non-MetS groups. Adiponectin, leptin, and resistin were found to have a significant role as predictors of MetS at an early stage of development of the syndrome, along with other common predictors. However, in later stages, fasting, blood glucose, waist circumference, and triglycerides remain significant predictors. Conclusion The present study reports a high prevalence of MetS among PCOS cases (40.27%). Altered adipokine levels may be significantly associated with the early stages of MetS development and\u00a0may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the management of MetS in PCOS. Therefore, the measurement of adipokines during preliminary investigations may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the\u00a0management of MetS in PCOS.",
          "Observational studies and meta-analyses have indicated a notable correlation between obesity and vitamin D deficiency, yet the causal relationship between the 2 remains contentious. This study employed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the interrelation between obesity-associated body metrics: specifically body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body fat percentage (BFP), whole-body fat percentage (WHF), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. Instrumental variables for BMI, WHR, BFP, whole body fat mass (WFM), and 25(OH)D were carefully selected based on predefined thresholds. The association between these metrics and 25(OH)D levels was assessed using the TwoSampleMR package in R 4.2.3. Analysis methods included inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode. Sensitivity analyses were conducted employing the TwoSampleMR and MR-PRESSO software packages in R 4.2.3 to evaluate heterogeneity and multiplicity of findings.

        "answer": "SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to have beneficial effects on kidney function. These inhibitors, such as those mentioned in Document 1, have expanded indications to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease. The document notes that the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population has increased and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of these inhibitors in Japan. This indicates that SGLT2 inhibitors are being used more widely in patients with kidney-related conditions. Additionally, Document 4 discusses how the progression of primary glomerular disease (PGD), a leading cause of chronic kidney disease, is associated with alterations in amino acid profiles. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors may have an impact on the metabolic processes related to kidney function. Overall, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors appears to have a positive effect on kidney function in patients with various kidney-related conditions.",

          "Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.",

The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale. Statistical analysis was performed to calculate effect sizes and assess heterogeneity among the studies. This review analyzed 29 out of 1,986 studies, conducted between 2005 and 2022, with participants from multiple countries. Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with age and gender, while associations with hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria were inconsistent. In the meta-analyses, a correlation between serum Gd-IgA1 and estimated glomerular filtration rate was identified, however, the relationships between Gd-IgA1 levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage and progression to kidney failure were inconsistent. Serum Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with validated prognostic risk factors, but were negatively correlated with kidney function.

          "Primary glomerular disease (PGD) is an idiopathic cause of renal glomerular lesions that is characterized by proteinuria or hematuria and is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

          "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity\u2013response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.",
          "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",
          "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.",

Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement.

Recently, researchers have developed various carbon dot sensors for fast and real-time Glu monitoring. In this context, we provide a comprehensive introduction to Glu and CDs for the first time. We categorize the synthetic methods for CDs and the sensing mechanisms, further classifying the applications of carbon dot probes into single-probe sensing, ratiometric sensing, and visual detection. Finally, we discuss the future development needs for CD-based Glu sensors. This review aims to offer insights into advancing Glu sensors and modern medical treatments."

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05.

In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy.

Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \\n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.3747374415397644, 'retrieval_method': 'initial_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC1748704811')",

It works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity. This helps to control blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin is often used in conjunction with lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise to effectively manage the condition.\n\nIn addition to metformin, there are other medications available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, such as insulin therapy and incretin-based therapies like GLP-1 receptor agonists. These medications can also help improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and may have beneficial effects beyond just lowering blood sugar levels.\n\nIt is important to note that the management of diabetes, especially in the perioperative setting, can be complex. Careful consideration must be given to balancing glucose control with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. Some patients may require insulin therapy to manage their diabetes, while others may experience severe hypoglycemia related to factors such as lipodystrophy.\n\nOverall, metformin is an effective medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but it is important to consider individual patient factors and potential side effects when determining the most appropriate treatment plan.

She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques.

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI).

However, the disease often relapses, which can impact allograft survival. We conducted a prospective multicenter study in France involving 72 patients with membranous nephropathy who were awaiting and then underwent kidney transplantation. In addition, we established a retrospective validation cohort of 65 patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic significance of pretransplant anti phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) antibodies on the recurrence of membranous nephropathy. The study also assessed the incidence rate, time to onset, and risk factors for recurrence, as well as allograft outcome. The prospective cohort showed a 26% cumulative incidence of membranous nephropathy recurrence after a median follow-up of 23.5 months.

          "Document(page_content='Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world.

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.\", metadata={'title': 'Lipodystrophy With an Uncommon Clinical Presentation in a Patient With Insulin-Requiring Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus', 'similarity_score': 0.4415598213672638, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC11650328')",

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI).

Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population.

Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy.

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM.

          "Document(page_content='In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences.

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI).

Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

          "We report the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy with a history of recurrent and severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy with an uncommon clinical presentation. This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022.

          "This study analyzes data from the 2009\u20132018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to explore the relationship between the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI), also referred to as the pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) among adults in the United States. Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.",

          "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",

          "Primary glomerular disease (PGD) is an idiopathic cause of renal glomerular lesions that is characterized by proteinuria or hematuria and is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

          "Membranous nephropathy can lead to end-stage kidney disease, for which kidney transplantation is the preferred therapy. However, the disease often relapses, which can impact allograft survival. We conducted a prospective multicenter study in France involving 72 patients with membranous nephropathy who were awaiting and then underwent kidney transplantation. In addition, we established a retrospective validation cohort of 65 patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic significance of pretransplant anti phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) antibodies on the recurrence of membranous nephropathy. The study also assessed the incidence rate, time to onset, and risk factors for recurrence, as well as allograft outcome. The prospective cohort showed a 26% cumulative incidence of membranous nephropathy recurrence after a median follow-up of 23.5 months. This was confirmed by a 28% cumulative incidence after a median follow-up of 67 months in the retrospective cohort. A strong association was found between the presence of anti-PLA2R1 antibodies prior to transplantation and the risk of disease recurrence (risk ratio\u00a0= 5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.3\u201315.7;  P The presence of anti-PLA2R1 antibodies prior to transplantation was a strong predictor of recurrence of allograft membranous nephropathy.

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.",

In the meta-analyses, a correlation between serum Gd-IgA1 and estimated glomerular filtration rate was identified, however, the relationships between Gd-IgA1 levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage and progression to kidney failure were inconsistent. Serum Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with validated prognostic risk factors, but were negatively correlated with kidney function. Further research in larger studies using standardized assays are needed to establish the value of Gd-IgA1 as a prognostic risk factor in IgAN. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40620-023-01874-8.",
          "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",
          "In recent years, advancements in immunosuppressive medications and post-transplant management have led to a significant decrease in acute rejection rates in renal allografts and consequent improvement in short-term graft survival. In contrast, recent data have shown an increased incidence of post-transplant glomerular diseases, which currently represent a leading cause of allograft loss. Although pathogenesis is not fully understood, growing evidence supports the role of inherited and immunological factors and has identified potential pre- and post-transplant predictors. In this review, we illustrate recent advancements in the pathogenesis of post-transplant glomerular disease and the role of risk factors and immunological triggers. In addition, we discuss potential prevention and management strategies.",

          "Primary glomerular disease (PGD) is an idiopathic cause of renal glomerular lesions that is characterized by proteinuria or hematuria and is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

          "Membranous nephropathy can lead to end-stage kidney disease, for which kidney transplantation is the preferred therapy. However, the disease often relapses, which can impact allograft survival. We conducted a prospective multicenter study in France involving 72 patients with membranous nephropathy who were awaiting and then underwent kidney transplantation. In addition, we established a retrospective validation cohort of 65 patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic significance of pretransplant anti phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) antibodies on the recurrence of membranous nephropathy. The study also assessed the incidence rate, time to onset, and risk factors for recurrence, as well as allograft outcome. The prospective cohort showed a 26% cumulative incidence of membranous nephropathy recurrence after a median follow-up of 23.5 months. This was confirmed by a 28% cumulative incidence after a median follow-up of 67 months in the retrospective cohort. A strong association was found between the presence of anti-PLA2R1 antibodies prior to transplantation and the risk of disease recurrence (risk ratio\u00a0= 5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.3\u201315.7;  P The presence of anti-PLA2R1 antibodies prior to transplantation was a strong predictor of recurrence of allograft membranous nephropathy.

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement.

This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022.

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.",

        "answer": "SGLT2 inhibition can have a positive effect on kidney function, as indicated by the study showing an increase in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly to the elderly population in Japan. This increase in prescription suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors are being used to treat conditions such as heart failure and chronic kidney disease, which can help improve kidney function. Additionally, the study mentions that the number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Overall, SGLT2 inhibition appears to be beneficial for kidney function, especially in specific populations and conditions.",

          "Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.",

The literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus, and the selected articles were evaluated for eligibility based on predefined criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale. Statistical analysis was performed to calculate effect sizes and assess heterogeneity among the studies. This review analyzed 29 out of 1,986 studies, conducted between 2005 and 2022, with participants from multiple countries. Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with age and gender, while associations with hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria were inconsistent. In the meta-analyses, a correlation between serum Gd-IgA1 and estimated glomerular filtration rate was identified, however, the relationships between Gd-IgA1 levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage and progression to kidney failure were inconsistent. Serum Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with validated prognostic risk factors, but were negatively correlated with kidney function. Further research in larger studies using standardized assays are needed to establish the value of Gd-IgA1 as a prognostic risk factor in IgAN. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40620-023-01874-8.",
          "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",
          "In recent years, advancements in immunosuppressive medications and post-transplant management have led to a significant decrease in acute rejection rates in renal allografts and consequent improvement in short-term graft survival. In contrast, recent data have shown an increased incidence of post-transplant glomerular diseases, which currently represent a leading cause of allograft loss. Although pathogenesis is not fully understood, growing evidence supports the role of inherited and immunological factors and has identified potential pre- and post-transplant predictors. In this review, we illustrate recent advancements in the pathogenesis of post-transplant glomerular disease and the role of risk factors and immunological triggers. In addition, we discuss potential prevention and management strategies.",

          "Primary glomerular disease (PGD) is an idiopathic cause of renal glomerular lesions that is characterized by proteinuria or hematuria and is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

          "Membranous nephropathy can lead to end-stage kidney disease, for which kidney transplantation is the preferred therapy. However, the disease often relapses, which can impact allograft survival. We conducted a prospective multicenter study in France involving 72 patients with membranous nephropathy who were awaiting and then underwent kidney transplantation. In addition, we established a retrospective validation cohort of 65 patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic significance of pretransplant anti phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) antibodies on the recurrence of membranous nephropathy. The study also assessed the incidence rate, time to onset, and risk factors for recurrence, as well as allograft outcome. The prospective cohort showed a 26% cumulative incidence of membranous nephropathy recurrence after a median follow-up of 23.5 months. This was confirmed by a 28% cumulative incidence after a median follow-up of 67 months in the retrospective cohort. A strong association was found between the presence of anti-PLA2R1 antibodies prior to transplantation and the risk of disease recurrence (risk ratio\u00a0= 5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.3\u201315.7;  P The presence of anti-PLA2R1 antibodies prior to transplantation was a strong predictor of recurrence of allograft membranous nephropathy.

          "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications.
