        "answer": "Metformin is a commonly used medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is often prescribed as a first-line therapy and works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity. Metformin has been shown to have beneficial effects beyond glycemic control, including cardiovascular and renal protection.\n\nIn the context documents, metformin is mentioned in various scenarios related to diabetes management. In Document 1, it is highlighted as a common treatment option for type 2 diabetes, emphasizing its role in improving insulin sensitivity and lowering glucose production. Document 3 discusses a case study where a patient with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy experienced severe hypoglycemia due to improper injection techniques, and the management involved switching to insulin analogs and educating the patient on correct injection methods.\n\nDocument 9 explores the potential neuroprotective role of metformin in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). The study aimed to investigate metformin as an adjuvant therapy in patients with PD, showing trends in biomarker changes that suggest a potential impact of adjunctive metformin use on the underlying pathophysiology of PD.\n\nOverall, the effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes include improving insulin sensitivity, lowering glucose production, and potentially providing neuroprotective benefits in related neurodegenerative disorders. Further research is needed to fully understand the extent of metformin's effects on diabetes management and associated conditions.",

In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients.

Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.\", metadata={}, id='3292')",

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21.

Document 1 highlights the expanded indications for SGLT2 inhibitors to include heart failure and CKD after the year 2020. The study shows that the total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings increased significantly from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2022. It is noted that patients aged 75 years and older accounted for a significant proportion of SGLT2 inhibitor prescriptions, indicating the use of these medications in an elderly population, which often has comorbidities including CKD.\n\nDocument 3 emphasizes the interplay between complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation in hemodialysis, which is crucial for individuals with CKD. The chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \"uremic inflammation\" in CKD can lead to premature aging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Furthermore, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) during hemodialysis can contribute to dialysis-induced systemic stress. These findings suggest that the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, which have been shown to improve heart failure and CKD outcomes, may help mitigate some of the negative consequences of chronic inflammation and complement activation in individuals with kidney disease.\n\nDocument 7 from the Maastricht Study indicates that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and higher levels of albuminuria are associated with worse physical performance, suggesting a direct correlation between kidney function and physical capacity. This information further supports the notion that preserving kidney function, which can be influenced by medications such as SGLT2 inhibitors, is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being.\n\nIn summary, the information provided in the context documents suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors play a significant role in improving kidney function, particularly in patients with CKD. By expanding the indications for these medications to include heart failure and CKD, healthcare providers can potentially enhance the management of kidney disease and associated complications, thus improving patient outcomes.

We serially sampled urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), serum cystatin C (sCyC), and \u03b22 microglobulin (s\u03b22-MG) on the day before CRS/HIPEC and then 2 h, 1 d, 2 d, 3 d, and 7 d after CRS/HIPEC. The primary outcome was the occurrence of AKI during the first 7 d. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were calculated to evaluate the detection performance. A total of 75 patients were eligible, of whom 5 (6.7%) fulfilled the criteria of AKI during the study period (AKI group) and 70 did not (non-AKI group). No significant differences were observed in these biomarkers between the two groups, except for s\u03b22-MG on day 3 ( P P P This is the first prospective study to evaluate the value of kidney-specific biomarkers in patients after CRS/HIPEC.

We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to repeatedly measure 1,542 lipid species from 1,886 American Indian adults attending 2 clinical examinations (mean ~5 years apart) in the Strong Heart Family Study. We used generalized estimating equation models to identify baseline lipid species associated with change in ABI and the Cox frailty regression to examine whether lipids associated with change in ABI were also associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD). We also examined the longitudinal association between change in lipid species and change in ABI and the cross-sectional association of individual lipids with ABI. All models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, and lipid-lowering medication. Baseline levels of 120 lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, fatty acids, and sphingomyelins, were associated with change in ABI. Among these, higher baseline levels of 3 known lipids (phosphatidylinositol[16:0/20:4], triacylglycerol[48:2], triacylglycerol[55:1]) were associated with a lower risk of CHD (hazard ratios [95% CIs] ranged from 0.67 [0.46\u20130.99] to 0.76 [0.58\u20130.99]), while cholesterol was associated with a higher risk of CHD (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.37 [1.00\u20131.87]). Longitudinal changes in 32 lipids were significantly associated with change in ABI during 5-year follow-up. Plasma levels of glycerophospholipids, triacylglycerols, and glycosylceramides were significantly associated with ABI in the cross-sectional analysis. Altered plasma lipidome is significantly associated with subclinical PAD in American Indians beyond traditional risk factors.

Despite treatment advancements, patients will still face vascular complications, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Human proteins play crucial roles in biology and drug research. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024.

The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis.

In the context documents provided, there is significant information on the mechanisms of various natural compounds and pathways involved in inflammation and immune responses, but there is no specific mention of glucocorticoids. However, based on general knowledge of glucocorticoids and their actions, we can explain how they suppress inflammation.\n\nGlucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects through multiple mechanisms. One of the key mechanisms is their ability to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins (IL-1, IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and other inflammatory mediators. This inhibition occurs at the transcriptional level by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm, translocating to the nucleus, and modulating gene expression.\n\nGlucocorticoids also suppress inflammation by interfering with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. NF-\u03baB is a key transcription factor that regulates the expression of various pro-inflammatory genes. Glucocorticoids inhibit NF-\u03baB activation by promoting the degradation of its inhibitor, I\u03baB\u03b1, thus preventing the translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus and subsequent gene transcription of inflammatory mediators.\n\nFurthermore, glucocorticoids can induce the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins, such as lipocortin-1 (annexin-1), which inhibits phospholipase A2 and reduces the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.\n\nOverall, glucocorticoids act on multiple levels to suppress inflammation, including inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, modulation of transcription factors like NF-\u03baB, and induction of anti-inflammatory proteins.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients.

          "Introduction Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS), as similarities in pathophysiology exist between the two. Adipokines are the key molecules that alter the adipose tissue metabolism and distribution, leading to MetS. This study was conducted to assess the levels of adipokines among patients with PCOS with and without MetS and to establish the role of adipokines as an early predictor for the development of MetS in PCOS. Materials and methods In this monocentric, tertiary hospital-based study, 144 patients with PCOS were selected and classified according to Rotterdam criteria and screened for MetS. Patients were grouped into MetS and non-MetS categories based on the presence of MetS. Adipokine levels (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin) were measured and compared, along with other biochemical and anthropological parameters. Data were analyzed using Jamovi statistical software, version 2.3 (Retrieved from  https://www.jamovi.org Results Out of the 144 patients included in the study, 58 were diagnosed with MetS and grouped as MetS. The prevalence of MetS was maximum among the non-PCO\u00a0(O+HA) phenotype\u00a0(53 out of 58). Significant differences\u00a0(p<0.001) in adipokines were observed between the MetS and non-MetS groups. Adiponectin, leptin, and resistin were found to have a significant role as predictors of MetS at an early stage of development of the syndrome, along with other common predictors. However, in later stages, fasting, blood glucose, waist circumference, and triglycerides remain significant predictors. Conclusion The present study reports a high prevalence of MetS among PCOS cases (40.27%). Altered adipokine levels may be significantly associated with the early stages of MetS development and\u00a0may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the management of MetS in PCOS. Therefore, the measurement of adipokines during preliminary investigations may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the\u00a0management of MetS in PCOS.",

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education."

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function.

          "Primary glomerular disease (PGD) is an idiopathic cause of renal glomerular lesions that is characterized by proteinuria or hematuria and is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

          "Membranous nephropathy can lead to end-stage kidney disease, for which kidney transplantation is the preferred therapy. However, the disease often relapses, which can impact allograft survival. We conducted a prospective multicenter study in France involving 72 patients with membranous nephropathy who were awaiting and then underwent kidney transplantation. In addition, we established a retrospective validation cohort of 65 patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic significance of pretransplant anti phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) antibodies on the recurrence of membranous nephropathy. The study also assessed the incidence rate, time to onset, and risk factors for recurrence, as well as allograft outcome. The prospective cohort showed a 26% cumulative incidence of membranous nephropathy recurrence after a median follow-up of 23.5 months. This was confirmed by a 28% cumulative incidence after a median follow-up of 67 months in the retrospective cohort. A strong association was found between the presence of anti-PLA2R1 antibodies prior to transplantation and the risk of disease recurrence (risk ratio\u00a0= 5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.3\u201315.7;  P The presence of anti-PLA2R1 antibodies prior to transplantation was a strong predictor of recurrence of allograft membranous nephropathy. An individualized immunomonitoring and management strategy for kidney transplant candidates with anti-PLA2R1-associated membranous nephropathy should be considered.",
          "In recent years, advancements in immunosuppressive medications and post-transplant management have led to a significant decrease in acute rejection rates in renal allografts and consequent improvement in short-term graft survival. In contrast, recent data have shown an increased incidence of post-transplant glomerular diseases, which currently represent a leading cause of allograft loss. Although pathogenesis is not fully understood, growing evidence supports the role of inherited and immunological factors and has identified potential pre- and post-transplant predictors. In this review, we illustrate recent advancements in the pathogenesis of post-transplant glomerular disease and the role of risk factors and immunological triggers. In addition, we discuss potential prevention and management strategies."

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.",
          "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.",

The aim was to identify any association between timing of PCSK9i mAb initiation after a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and the rate of subsequent MACE. A retrospective cohort study of adult patients in the United States with a MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) from January 1, 2017 to February 28, 2022 was conducted using administrative claims databases (index date = first observed MACE during this period). Patients were required to have \u2265360 days of data visibility prior to (baseline period) and for \u226530 days after the index date (minimum, variable follow up period), and \u22651 prescription claim for PCSK9i mAb therapy on or after the index date. Subsequent MACE rates, time from index MACE to PCSK9i mAb initiation, and time to subsequent MACE were reported. A total of 58,997 patients with \u22651 MACE were identified (mean age = 64 years; 58% male; median follow up=1,241 days). Over half of the patients did not initiate a PCSK9i mAb in the first year after the index MACE. Overall, 35% (n = 20,465) had \u22651 subsequent MACE. Compared to the period between index MACE and prior to PCSK9i mAb initiation, rates of subsequent MACE after PCSK9i mAb initiation were reduced in a time-dependent manner by 70% among patients who initiated PCSK9i mAb therapy within 30 days, 78% (31\u201390 days), 76% (91\u2013180 days), 65% (181\u2013360 days), and 42% (>360 days) after the index MACE. Those who initiated PCSK9i mAb within 30 days of the index MACE had longer median time to the first subsequent MACE (111 days) compared to patients who initiated at later times. This study provides evidence that earlier initiation of PCSK9i mAb therapy after a MACE appeared to be associated with longer time to a subsequent MACE. Patients without timely treatment are left at an unnecessarily elevated risk of further MACE.",
          "Metabolic surgery, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), may improve hypertension (HTN) complicated by severe obesity; however, insufficient deliberation exists regarding the therapeutic effect of post-metabolic surgery on HTN. This study aimed to analyze the factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG in patients who have severe obesity, and to create a classification system to predict HTN remission and recurrence. Of the 102 patients who underwent LSG at Iwate Medical University Hospital between 2008 and 2020, 62 were enrolled in this study. Factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG were retrospectively analyzed. The HTN remission rate 12-months post-LSG was 40.3%. The remission cohort had a lower number of preoperative antihypertensive drugs (ADs) than that of the non-remission cohort (one and two tablets, respectively; p< 0.001). Additionally, the remission cohort had a statistically significantly smaller visceral fat area (VFA) than that of the non-remission cohort, at all time points. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were independent predictors of remission. The HTN recurrence rate 36-months post-LSG was 36.0%. In the recurrence cohort, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were higher and larger than that in the non-recurrence cohort, respectively. Stratification, based on the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, revealed that the HTN remission and recurrence rates in the sub-cohort with a small number of preoperative ADs and small VFA (100% and 16.7%, respectively) were better than those in the sub-cohort with a large number of preoperative ADs and large VFA (5.3% and 100%, respectively). In Japanese patients with severe obesity, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG. Stratification, by combining the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, may be useful in predicting HTN remission and recurrence.",
          "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity\u2013response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.",

Cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential for regulating bone homeostasis. Osteoclasts, multinucleated giant cells differentiated from macrophage lineage, are responsible for osteolytic bone conditions which are closely linked to ROS signaling pathways. In this study, an anti\u2010ROS enzyme, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) was found to be expressed both in bone marrow macrophages and osteoclasts. Recombinant Prdx1 protein was found to dose\u2010dependently inhibit ROS production and osteoclast differentiation.

          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.",
          "Lipid droplets (LDs) serve as crucial hubs for lipid trafficking and metabolic regulation through their numerous interactions with various organelles. While the interplay between LDs and the Golgi apparatus has been recognized, their roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the role of Ras-related protein Rab-2A (Rab2A) in mediating LD-Golgi interactions, thereby contributing to very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipidation and secretion in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, our findings identify a selective interaction between Golgi-localized Rab2A and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) protein residing on LDs. This complex facilitates dynamic organelle communication between the Golgi apparatus and LDs, thus contributing to lipid transfer from LDs to the Golgi apparatus for VLDL2 lipidation and secretion. Attenuation of Rab2A activity via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses the Rab2A-HSD17B13 complex formation, impairing LD-Golgi interactions and subsequent VLDL secretion. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Rab2A and HSD17B13 in the liver reduces the serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Collectively, this study provides a new perspective on the interactions between the Golgi apparatus and LDs.",
          "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a form of severe acute stroke with very high mortality and disability rates. Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.",
          "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging.

Despite treatment advancements, patients will still face vascular complications, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Human proteins play crucial roles in biology and drug research. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

          "Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials."

Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01).

The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included \u201cheart failure\u201d, \u201cccTGA\u201d, \u201cVAD\u201d, \u201cheart transplantation\u201d, and \u201csystemic RV failure\u201d. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.",

Subsequent MACE rates, time from index MACE to PCSK9i mAb initiation, and time to subsequent MACE were reported. A total of 58,997 patients with \u22651 MACE were identified (mean age = 64 years; 58% male; median follow up=1,241 days). Over half of the patients did not initiate a PCSK9i mAb in the first year after the index MACE. Overall, 35% (n = 20,465) had \u22651 subsequent MACE. Compared to the period between index MACE and prior to PCSK9i mAb initiation, rates of subsequent MACE after PCSK9i mAb initiation were reduced in a time-dependent manner by 70% among patients who initiated PCSK9i mAb therapy within 30 days, 78% (31\u201390 days), 76% (91\u2013180 days), 65% (181\u2013360 days), and 42% (>360 days) after the index MACE. Those who initiated PCSK9i mAb within 30 days of the index MACE had longer median time to the first subsequent MACE (111 days) compared to patients who initiated at later times. This study provides evidence that earlier initiation of PCSK9i mAb therapy after a MACE appeared to be associated with longer time to a subsequent MACE. Patients without timely treatment are left at an unnecessarily elevated risk of further MACE."

This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",
          "Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.",
          "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions. In this review, we highlight current findings on the role of ILCs and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma development and pathogenesis. We also examine the underlying mechanisms regulating their function and their interplay with other immune cells. Finally, we explore current therapies targeting these cells and their effector cytokines for asthma management.",
          "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.",
          "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",
          "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.",
          "To assess whether simultaneous normalization of late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC) and mean urinary free cortisol (mUFC) in patients with Cushing disease treated with osilodrostat is associated with better clinical outcomes than control of mUFC or LNSC alone. Pooled data from two phase III osilodrostat studies (LINC 3 and LINC 4) were analyzed. Both comprised a 48-week core phase and an optional open-label extension. Changes in cardiovascular/metabolic-related parameters, physical manifestations of hypercortisolism, and quality of life (QoL) were evaluated across the following patient subgroups: both LNSC and mUFC controlled, only mUFC controlled, only LNSC controlled, and neither controlled. Of 160 patients included in the analysis, 85.0% had both LNSC and mUFC uncontrolled at baseline. At week 72, 48.6% of patients had both LNSC and mUFC controlled; these patients generally exhibited greater improvements in cardiovascular/metabolic-related parameters than those with only mUFC controlled or both LNSC and mUFC uncontrolled: systolic/diastolic blood pressure, \u22127.4%/\u22124.9%, \u22126.0%/\u22125.5%, and 2.3%/0.8%, respectively; fasting plasma glucose, \u22125.0%, \u22124.8%, and 1.9%; glycated hemoglobin, \u22125.1%, \u22124.8%, and \u22121.3%. Weight, waist circumference, and body mass index improved with control of LNSC and/or mUFC; physical manifestations of hypercortisolism generally improved regardless of LNSC/mUFC control. Patients with both LNSC and mUFC controlled or only mUFC controlled had the greatest improvement from baseline to week 72 in QoL. In osilodrostat-treated patients with Cushing disease, normalization of LNSC and mUFC led to improvements in long-term outcomes, indicating that treatment should aim for normalization of both parameters for optimal patient outcomes.

          "To investigate inflammatory responses in peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) in comparison to periodontal tissue. Nineteen participants with healthy implants restored with titanium or gold-casting abutment were included. PICF and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were collected for inflammatory cytokine detection by ELISA. Cytokine levels in PICF or GCF of the same individual were compared using the paired t-test, and those from titanium or gold-casting (UCLA) abutment were compared using the independent t-test. Human gingival fibroblast responses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3 expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same individual. However, IL-1\u03b2 (p = 0.032) and IL-1\u03b1 (p = 0.030) was statistically significantly higher in PICF than in GCF. IL-8 level was statistically significantly higher with gold-casting than with titanium abutments (p = 0.003). PICF statistically significantly stimulated higher expression of RANKL, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF), while focal adhesion kinase (FAK) suppressed mRNA. The inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, are higher in healthy peri-implant tissues. Abutment materials may also influence the level of inflammatory cytokines in PICF.

This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants\u2019 workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.",

Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut\u2010off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut\u2010off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L).

We demonstrated improvements in pain and functional scores, as well as knee injury protection in athletes, following 12\u00a0months of PRP and PRP with ESWT treatments. The study analyzed the therapeutic effect of PRP injection alone and combining PRP injection with ESWT for chronic patellar tendinopathy. Our results showed that combined treatment can facilitate the pain relief early than PRP alone and is a safety treatment modality. No adverse effect was noted in our study.

          "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",
          "Recent studies hint at mitochondrial genes influencing UC patient response to anti-TNF treatment. We evaluated this hypothesis by following a targeted strategy to identify gene expression that captures the relationship between mitochondrial dysregulation and response to treatment. Our objective was to initially examine this relationship in colon samples and subsequently assess whether the resulting signal persists in the bloodstream. We analyzed the transcriptome of colon samples from an anti-TNF-treated murine model characterized by impaired mitochondrial activity and treatment resistance. We then transferred the findings that linked mitochondrial dysfunction and compromised treatment response to an anti-TNF-treated UC human cohort. We next matched differential expression in the blood using monocytes from the peripheral blood of controls and IBD patients, and we evaluated a classification process at baseline with whole blood samples from UC patients. In human colon samples, the derived gene set from the murine model showed differential expression, primarily enriched metabolic pathways, and exhibited similar classification capacity as genes enriching inflammatory pathways. Moreover, the evaluation of the classification signal using blood samples from UC patients at baseline highlighted the involvement of mitochondrial homeostasis in treatment response. Our results highlight the involvement of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial homeostasis in determining treatment response and their ability to provide promising classification signals with detection levels in both the colon and the bloodstream."

          "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily for 3\u00a0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily and 500\u00a0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group). Patients were assessed via Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The serum concentrations of toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4), \u03b1-synuclein, brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) were measured before and after treatment.

          "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an efficient treatment for movement disorders, most commonly Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), dystonia and essential tremor. DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.",

          "Cognitive impairment, a major determinant of poor functioning in schizophrenia, had limited responses to existing antipsychotic drugs. The limited efficacy could be due to regional differences in the dysregulation of the dopamine system. This study investigated striatal and peripheral dopaminergic makers in schizophrenia and their relationship with cognitive impairment. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated. We evaluated their cognitive performance, examined the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT, and measured plasma levels of dopaminergic precursors (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) that compete with precursors for brain uptake via ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Schizophrenia patients exhibited lower cognitive performance, decreased striatal DAT availability, and reduced levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA. Within the patient group, lower DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen was positively associated with attention deficits. Meanwhile, lower tyrosine levels and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA were positively related to executive dysfunction. Among all participants, DAT availability in the right CN or putamen was positively related to memory function, and plasma phenylalanine level was positively associated with executive function. This study supports the role of dopamine system abnormalities in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The distinct associations between different dopaminergic alterations and specific cognitive domain impairments suggest the potential need for multifaceted treatment approaches to target these impairments.",
          "Tic disorders represent a developmental neuropsychiatric condition whose causes can be attributed to a variety of environmental, neurobiological, and genetic factors. From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In this paper, therefore, we summarize the evidence to date on these abnormalities with the intent to illustrate and clarify the main neuroanatomical differences between patients with tic disorders and healthy individuals.",

Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (\u0394scales), OCT (\u0394retinal thickness), PERG (\u0394PERG values) and VEP (\u0394P100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral \u0394N95 latencies for PERG and \u0394P100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT.

          "In severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), sedatives are often used to control intracranial pressure (ICP), to reduce brain metabolism, to allow for other treatments such as mechanical ventilation or targeted temperature management, or to control paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\u00a0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\u00a0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\u00a0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\u00a0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points.

          "Previous studies have shown an association between the thalamocortical dysconnectivity and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Whether a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine may change thalamocortical connectivity among patients with TRD is unclear. Whether these changes in thalamocortical connectivity is associated with the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine treatment is also unclear. Two resting-state functional MRIs were collected in two clinical trials of 48 patients with TRD (clinical trial 1; 32 receiving ketamine, 16 receiving a normal saline placebo) and 48 patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation (clinical trial 2; 24 receiving ketamine, 24 receiving midazolam), respectively. All participants underwent rs-fMRI before and 3 days after infusion. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) was analyzed in the left/right thalamus. FCs between the bilateral thalamus and right middle frontal cortex (BA46) and between the left thalamus and left anterior paracingulate gyrus (BA8) increased among patients in the ketamine group in clinical trials 1 and 2, respectively.

          "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, which is mainly characterized by the abnormal deposition of \u03b2\u2010amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) and Tau. Since Tau aggregation is more closely associated with synaptic loss, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline than A\u03b2, the correlation between Tau and cognitive function in AD has gradually gained attention. The posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of Tau are key factors contributing to its pathological changes, which include phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation, glycation, small ubiquitin\u2010like modifier mediated modification (SUMOylation), methylation, succinylation, etc. These modifications change the structure of Tau, regulating Tau microtubule interactions, localization, degradation, and aggregation, thereby affecting its propensity to aggregate and leading to neuronal injury and cognitive impairments. Among numerous PTMs, drug development based on phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation primarily involves enzymatic reactions, affecting either the phosphorylation or degradation processes of Tau. Meanwhile, methylation, glycosylation, and succinylation are associated with maintaining the structural stability of Tau. Current research is more extensive on phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and methylation, with related drugs already developed, particularly focusing on phosphorylation and ubiquitination. In contrast, there is less research on SUMOylation, glycosylation, and succinylation, requiring further basic research, with the potential to become novel drug targets. In conclusion, this review summarized the latest research on PTMs of Tau and related drugs, highlighting the potential of targeting specific PTMs for developing novel therapeutic strategies in AD."

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM.

Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies.

The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications.

Among these, higher baseline levels of 3 known lipids (phosphatidylinositol[16:0/20:4], triacylglycerol[48:2], triacylglycerol[55:1]) were associated with a lower risk of CHD (hazard ratios [95% CIs] ranged from 0.67 [0.46\u20130.99] to 0.76 [0.58\u20130.99]), while cholesterol was associated with a higher risk of CHD (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.37 [1.00\u20131.87]). Longitudinal changes in 32 lipids were significantly associated with change in ABI during 5-year follow-up.

Despite treatment advancements, patients will still face vascular complications, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Human proteins play crucial roles in biology and drug research. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development.

The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation.

The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts.

This leads to a reduction in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins and tumor necrosis factor, and an increase in the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.\n\nGlucocorticoids also inhibit the activity of key transcription factors involved in the inflammatory process, such as NF-kB and AP-1.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.34900763630867004, 'retrieval_method': 'knowledge_base_expansion'}, id='PMC11619819')",

        "answer": "The mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease is related to its conversion into dopamine in the brain. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a decrease in dopamine levels. Levodopa, also known as L-DOPA, is a precursor to dopamine that can cross the blood-brain barrier and be converted into dopamine in the brain by dopa decarboxylase enzyme.\n\nBy increasing dopamine levels in the brain, levodopa helps to alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Levodopa is considered one of the most effective medications for managing the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, long-term use of levodopa can be associated with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias.\n\nIt is important to note that levodopa provides symptomatic relief in Parkinson's disease but does not slow down the progression of the disease. Research is ongoing to develop new disease-modifying treatments that can target the underlying mechanisms of Parkinson's disease, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and dopaminergic neuronal loss. Additional studies are needed to fully understand the complex pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and identify new therapeutic targets for disease modification.",

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development.

The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.399313747882843, 'retrieval_method': 'colbert_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC11650366')",

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.42549756169319153, 'retrieval_method': 'colbert_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC1748704565')",

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine.

Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world. While the key elements are agreed upon, more research and global collaboration are needed to create consistent guidelines and improve patient outcomes.', metadata={'title': 'Preoperative management of diabetes mellitus: A comparative narrative review of the recommendations of three professional organizations with Hamad Medical Corporation guidelines', 'similarity_score': 0.5278230905532837, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC1748704577')",

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.\", metadata={'title': 'Lipodystrophy With an Uncommon Clinical Presentation in a Patient With Insulin-Requiring Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus', 'similarity_score': 0.4415598213672638, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC11650328')",

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI).

Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes.

Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes.

This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development.

The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation.

Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF.

The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.

They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.\", metadata={'title': 'Modulation of the central nervous system immune response and neuroinflammation via Wnt signaling in health and neurodegenerative diseases', 'similarity_score': 0.3916708827018738, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC11649390')",

Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment.

          "Document(page_content='Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', metadata={'title': 'Menisoxoisoaporphine A, a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid from Menispermi Rhizoma, inhibits inflammation by targeting PDE4B', 'similarity_score': 0.35597896575927734, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC11649434')",

The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases.

          "This study analyzes data from the 2009\u20132018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to explore the relationship between the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI), also referred to as the pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) among adults in the United States. Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.",

Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30).

          "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",

In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS.

The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.",
          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.",

          "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.",

They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease.

          "Although the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), primarily manifests as severe respiratory distress, its impact on the cardiovascular system is also notable. Studies reveal that COVID\u201019 patients often suffer from certain vascular diseases, partly attributed to increased proliferation or altered phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Although the association between COVID\u201019 and VSMCs is recognized, the precise mechanism underlying SARS\u2010CoV\u20102's influence on VSMC phenotype remains largely under\u2010reviewed. In this context, while there is a consistent body of literature dissecting the effect of COVID\u201019 on the cardiovascular system, few reports delve into the potential role of VSMC switching in the pathophysiology associated with COVID\u201019 and the molecular mechanisms involved therein. This review dissects and critiques the link between COVID\u201019 and VSMCs, with particular attention to pathways involving cholesterol, calcium, and phosphate. These pathways underpin the interaction between the virus and VSMCs. Such interaction promotes VSMC proliferation, and eventually potentiates vascular calcification as well as worsens prognosis in patients with COVID\u201019.",
          "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.",

          "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and dyslipidemia are both independent predictors of cardiovascular disease, but the association between individual lipid species and subclinical PAD, assessed by ankle-brachial index (ABI), is lacking in large-scale longitudinal studies. We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to repeatedly measure 1,542 lipid species from 1,886 American Indian adults attending 2 clinical examinations (mean ~5 years apart) in the Strong Heart Family Study. We used generalized estimating equation models to identify baseline lipid species associated with change in ABI and the Cox frailty regression to examine whether lipids associated with change in ABI were also associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD). We also examined the longitudinal association between change in lipid species and change in ABI and the cross-sectional association of individual lipids with ABI. All models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, and lipid-lowering medication. Baseline levels of 120 lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, fatty acids, and sphingomyelins, were associated with change in ABI. Among these, higher baseline levels of 3 known lipids (phosphatidylinositol[16:0/20:4], triacylglycerol[48:2], triacylglycerol[55:1]) were associated with a lower risk of CHD (hazard ratios [95% CIs] ranged from 0.67 [0.46\u20130.99] to 0.76 [0.58\u20130.99]), while cholesterol was associated with a higher risk of CHD (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.37 [1.00\u20131.87]). Longitudinal changes in 32 lipids were significantly associated with change in ABI during 5-year follow-up. Plasma levels of glycerophospholipids, triacylglycerols, and glycosylceramides were significantly associated with ABI in the cross-sectional analysis. Altered plasma lipidome is significantly associated with subclinical PAD in American Indians beyond traditional risk factors. If validated, the identified lipid species may serve as novel biomarkers for PAD in this high-risk but understudied population.",

          "Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a common cardiovascular condition marked by peripheral artery stenosis or occlusion. Despite treatment advancements, patients will still face vascular complications, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Human proteins play crucial roles in biology and drug research. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included \u201cheart failure\u201d, \u201cccTGA\u201d, \u201cVAD\u201d, \u201cheart transplantation\u201d, and \u201csystemic RV failure\u201d. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.",

This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases.

          "Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.",

          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",
          "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.",

          "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",
          "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging.

          "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions. In this review, we highlight current findings on the role of ILCs and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma development and pathogenesis. We also examine the underlying mechanisms regulating their function and their interplay with other immune cells.

          "Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.",

Cytokine levels in PICF or GCF of the same individual were compared using the paired t-test, and those from titanium or gold-casting (UCLA) abutment were compared using the independent t-test. Human gingival fibroblast responses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3 expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same individual. However, IL-1\u03b2 (p = 0.032) and IL-1\u03b1 (p = 0.030) was statistically significantly higher in PICF than in GCF.

A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR.

          "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.",
          "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.",

          "Failure rate of meniscal repair can reach 25%. Multiple techniques have been used to increase meniscal healing, notably biological augmentation techniques. One of them is fibrin clot\u2013augmented meniscal repair, which will be described in this video. This technique is indicated mainly for the lesions with a high failure rate. This includes large, horizontal, and radial tears and even for meniscal cysts, especially in a stable knee. This technique can also be used in revision meniscal suture when failure is no longer an option. Fibrin clot is prepared from sterile peripheral venous blood from the patient. A plastic syringe is used to stir the blood in a sterile glass container. The fibrin clot is then formed and washed rigorously with saline solution. Rolling the fibrin clot which is fixed to the syringe allows to give the fibrillar aspect of the clot. The formed fibrin clot is now solid enough to be manipulated and can be fixed to a vicryl suture thread allowing it to enter the knee and be fixed inside the meniscal lesion. The clot is wrapped inside the meniscal lesion with inside-out or outside-in suture technique. We used this technique for multiple types of lesions, like bucket handle meniscal tear, horizontal meniscal cleavage, parrot beak tear, and even in lesions within white-white zone. The postoperative protocol is the same as standard inside-out meniscal repair. This technique has been used in the literature with promising results. The fibrin clot\u2013augmented meniscal repair is a demanding but promising technique. We need further follow-up to confirm its effectiveness.

          "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily for 3\u00a0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily and 500\u00a0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group). Patients were assessed via Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The serum concentrations of toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4), \u03b1-synuclein, brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) were measured before and after treatment. The improvement in UPDRS from baseline to 3\u00a0months. Change in the level of biological markers. The control group did not show significant difference in UPDRS when compared to their baseline value by Wilcoxon test ( P P P P While no significant differences in UPDRS scores were observed between the metformin and control groups, trends in biomarker changes suggest a potential impact of adjunctive metformin use on the underlying pathophysiology of PD.

          "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an efficient treatment for movement disorders, most commonly Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), dystonia and essential tremor. DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.",
          "Tic disorders represent a developmental neuropsychiatric condition whose causes can be attributed to a variety of environmental, neurobiological, and genetic factors. From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In this paper, therefore, we summarize the evidence to date on these abnormalities with the intent to illustrate and clarify the main neuroanatomical differences between patients with tic disorders and healthy individuals.",

          "Bright light therapy (BLT) has been proved to have beneficial effects on Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), the mechanisms remained unclear. Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (\u0394scales), OCT (\u0394retinal thickness), PERG (\u0394PERG values) and VEP (\u0394P100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral \u0394N95 latencies for PERG and \u0394P100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT. BLT is a valuable and safe non-pharmacological intervention for improving visual function in PD patients. These findings extend neural mechanisms of BLT to visual pathways improvements.

          "An increasing body of evidence indicates altered DNA methylation in Parkinson's disease, yet the reproducibility and utility of such methylation changes are largely unexplored. We aimed to further elucidate the role of dysregulated DNA methylation in Parkinson's disease and to evaluate the biomarker potential of methylation\u2010based profiling. We conducted an epigenome\u2010wide association study (EWAS) in whole blood, including 280 Parkinson's disease and 279 control participants from Oslo, Norway. Next, we took advantage of data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and a previously published EWAS to conduct a whole blood EWAS meta\u2010analysis in Parkinson's disease, incorporating results from a total of 3068 participants. Finally, we generated multiple methylation\u2010based scores for each Oslo and PPMI participant and tested their association with disease status, individually and in a joint multiscore model. In EWAS meta\u2010analysis, we confirm  SLC7A11 LPIN1 Our results highlight the power of DNA methylation profiling to capture multiple aspects of disease risk, indicating a biomarker potential for precision medicine in neurodegenerative disorders.

          "Neurodegenerative disorders encompass a group of age\u2010related conditions characterized by the gradual decline in both the structure and functionality of the central nervous system (CNS). RNA modifications, arising from the epitranscriptome or RNA\u2010modifying protein mutations, have recently been observed to contribute significantly to neurodegenerative disorders. Specific modifications like N6\u2010methyladenine (m6A), N1\u2010methyladenine (m1A), 5\u2010methylcytosine (m5C), pseudouridine and adenosine\u2010to\u2010inosine (A\u2010to\u2010I) play key roles, with their regulators serving as crucial therapeutic targets. These epitranscriptomic changes intricately control gene expression, influencing cellular functions and contributing to disease pathology. Dysregulation of RNA metabolism, affecting mRNA processing and noncoding RNA biogenesis, is a central factor in these diseases. This review underscores the complex relationship between RNA modifications and neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing the influence of RNA modification and the epitranscriptome, exploring the function of RNA modification enzymes in neurodegenerative processes, investigating the functional consequences of RNA modifications within neurodegenerative pathways, and evaluating the potential therapeutic advancements derived from assessing the epitranscriptome.",
