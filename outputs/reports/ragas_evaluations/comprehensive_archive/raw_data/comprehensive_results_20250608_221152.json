Document 1 highlights that metformin is often the first-line medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity. Document 9 further explores the potential role of metformin as an adjuvant therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease, suggesting a potential neuroprotective role of metformin in neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nWhile Document 1 emphasizes the effectiveness of metformin in managing type 2 diabetes through glucose control and improved insulin sensitivity, Document 9 delves into the potential neuroprotective effects of metformin in Parkinson's disease. However, more information is needed to fully understand the specific and comprehensive effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes, such as its long-term impact on glycemic control, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.

In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients.

Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.\", metadata={}, id='3292')",

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \\n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.', metadata={}, id='2551')",

However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.', metadata={}, id='2641')",

We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to repeatedly measure 1,542 lipid species from 1,886 American Indian adults attending 2 clinical examinations (mean ~5 years apart) in the Strong Heart Family Study. We used generalized estimating equation models to identify baseline lipid species associated with change in ABI and the Cox frailty regression to examine whether lipids associated with change in ABI were also associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD). We also examined the longitudinal association between change in lipid species and change in ABI and the cross-sectional association of individual lipids with ABI. All models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, and lipid-lowering medication. Baseline levels of 120 lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, fatty acids, and sphingomyelins, were associated with change in ABI. Among these, higher baseline levels of 3 known lipids (phosphatidylinositol[16:0/20:4], triacylglycerol[48:2], triacylglycerol[55:1]) were associated with a lower risk of CHD (hazard ratios [95% CIs] ranged from 0.67 [0.46\u20130.99] to 0.76 [0.58\u20130.99]), while cholesterol was associated with a higher risk of CHD (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.37 [1.00\u20131.87]). Longitudinal changes in 32 lipids were significantly associated with change in ABI during 5-year follow-up.

Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

        "answer": "The context documents do not specifically mention the role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure. However, based on general medical knowledge, ACE inhibitors are commonly used in the management of heart failure. ACE inhibitors help to reduce the strain on the heart by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which normally leads to the production of angiotensin II, a substance that constricts blood vessels and raises blood pressure. By blocking this enzyme, ACE inhibitors help to widen blood vessels, lower blood pressure, and improve blood flow, which can alleviate symptoms of heart failure and improve overall heart function.\n\nIn the context of the documents provided, treatments for heart failure such as SGLT2 inhibitors, Zileuton, and UDCA were discussed, but ACE inhibitors were not specifically mentioned. It is important to note that ACE inhibitors are a cornerstone of heart failure treatment and are commonly prescribed in combination with other medications to manage heart failure symptoms and improve outcomes for patients.

The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts.

While the context documents provide detailed information on the mechanisms of action of several compounds in suppressing inflammation, including fucoxanthin, Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), and the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), they do not specifically address the role of glucocorticoids in inflammation suppression.\n\nGlucocorticoids are a class of corticosteroid hormones that have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. They act by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, which are located in the cytoplasm of immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Upon binding, glucocorticoids translocate into the nucleus and modulate gene expression by interacting with specific glucocorticoid response elements in the promoter regions of target genes.\n\nOne of the key mechanisms by which glucocorticoids suppress inflammation is through the inhibition of pro-inflammatory gene expression. Glucocorticoids can block the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1). By reducing the production of these cytokines, glucocorticoids dampen the inflammatory response and prevent the recruitment and activation of immune cells at the site of inflammation.\n\nAdditionally, glucocorticoids can inhibit the activity of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), which are key regulators of inflammatory gene expression. By interfering with the activation of these transcription factors, glucocorticoids prevent the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and the subsequent amplification of the inflammatory response.\n\nFurthermore, glucocorticoids can also promote the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and lipocortin-1, which act to suppress inflammation and resolve the immune response.\n\nIn summary, glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory gene expression, blocking the activity of key transcription factors, and promoting the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins.

          "Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

In Document 1, it is mentioned that patients with Parkinson's disease were divided into two groups, with one group receiving levodopa/carbidopa three times daily. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is deficient in Parkinson's disease due to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. By providing levodopa, the medication aims to replenish dopamine levels in the brain, thus helping to alleviate the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease.\n\nWhile Document 1 focuses on the role of metformin as an adjuvant therapy in Parkinson's disease, it does not specifically detail the mechanism of action of levodopa. Levodopa is converted to dopamine in the brain, where it acts to improve motor function and reduce symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Levodopa is usually administered in combination with carbidopa to prevent the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in peripheral tissues before it reaches the brain, thereby increasing the amount of levodopa available for conversion to dopamine in the brain.\n\nIn conclusion, levodopa works by increasing dopamine levels in the brain, compensating for the dopamine deficiency caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease.",

Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.', metadata={}, id='2388')",

It is often prescribed as a first-line therapy to help lower glucose production in the liver and improve insulin sensitivity. Metformin can be used alone or in combination with other medications such as insulin therapy or other oral medications.\n\nDocument 1 describes metformin as a first-line medication for type 2 diabetes, highlighting its role in improving insulin sensitivity and lowering glucose production in the liver. It is an essential component of the treatment plan for individuals with type 2 diabetes.\n\nDocument 3 discusses a case study where a patient with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy experienced severe hypoglycemia due to improper insulin injection techniques, leading to lipohypertrophy. The therapeutic management in this case involved switching the patient to insulin analogs and educating them on correct injection techniques. This highlights the importance of proper medication administration and adherence to treatment plans, including the use of metformin.\n\nDocument 9 explores the potential neuroprotective role of metformin in patients with Parkinson's disease. The study aimed to assess the impact of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease and measured various biomarkers before and after treatment. While the study did not show significant differences in motor symptoms between the metformin and control groups, there were trends in biomarker changes suggesting a potential impact of metformin on the underlying pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.\n\nIn conclusion, metformin plays a crucial role in the management of type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity and glucose control. It is often used as a first-line medication and can be beneficial when used correctly and in conjunction with other therapies. Additionally, there is ongoing research into the potential neuroprotective effects of metformin in other conditions, such as Parkinson's disease.

        "answer": "The context documents do not specifically mention how statins prevent cardiovascular disease. However, based on general medical knowledge, statins are a class of medications commonly used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. They work by inhibiting an enzyme in the liver that is responsible for producing cholesterol. By reducing cholesterol levels, statins can help prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which is a key factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, including conditions such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Additionally, statins have anti-inflammatory effects and may help stabilize plaque in the arteries, reducing the risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture and subsequent cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes.",

We used generalized estimating equation models to identify baseline lipid species associated with change in ABI and the Cox frailty regression to examine whether lipids associated with change in ABI were also associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD).

Baseline levels of 120 lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, fatty acids, and sphingomyelins, were associated with change in ABI. Among these, higher baseline levels of 3 known lipids (phosphatidylinositol[16:0/20:4], triacylglycerol[48:2], triacylglycerol[55:1]) were associated with a lower risk of CHD (hazard ratios [95% CIs] ranged from 0.67 [0.46\u20130.99] to 0.76 [0.58\u20130.99]), while cholesterol was associated with a higher risk of CHD (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.37 [1.00\u20131.87]).

Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target.

In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks.

They are commonly used in the treatment of various inflammatory conditions due to their ability to suppress the immune response and reduce inflammation.\n\nFrom the provided context documents, several mechanisms by which glucocorticoids suppress inflammation can be inferred:\n\n1. **Document 1**: The document discusses the anti-inflammatory properties of fucoxanthin, a natural carotenoid. It mentions that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. This suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggests an inhibitory effect on the inflammatory cascade.\n\n2. **Document 4**: This document discusses the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine release and proinflammatory gene expression in RAW264.7 cells. The study also suggests that MA inhibits the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. NF-\u03baB is a key transcription factor involved in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, and its inhibition by MA implies a mechanism of suppressing inflammation.\n\n3. **Document 10**: The document mentions a pilot study that used RNA-Seq to quantify the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from COVID-recovered individuals, some of whom had Long COVID symptoms. The study identified genes associated with cell survival and inflammation that were significantly up- or down-regulated in Long COVID samples.

          "Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.\", metadata={}, id='2946')",

          "Document(page_content='Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', metadata={}, id='2971')",

The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin.

A plastic syringe is used to stir the blood in a sterile glass container. The fibrin clot is then formed and washed rigorously with saline solution. Rolling the fibrin clot which is fixed to the syringe allows to give the fibrillar aspect of the clot. The formed fibrin clot is now solid enough to be manipulated and can be fixed to a vicryl suture thread allowing it to enter the knee and be fixed inside the meniscal lesion. The clot is wrapped inside the meniscal lesion with inside-out or outside-in suture technique. We used this technique for multiple types of lesions, like bucket handle meniscal tear, horizontal meniscal cleavage, parrot beak tear, and even in lesions within white-white zone. The postoperative protocol is the same as standard inside-out meniscal repair. This technique has been used in the literature with promising results.

        "answer": "Levodopa is a key medication used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is converted to dopamine in the brain, where it helps to replenish the depleted levels of dopamine due to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in coordinating smooth and balanced muscle movement. In Parkinson's disease, the loss of dopamine-producing neurons leads to motor dysfunction and the characteristic symptoms of the disease.\n\nDocument 1 discusses a study where patients with Parkinson's disease were treated with levodopa/carbidopa, which is a combination medication that includes levodopa. The study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease. Metformin has been shown to have a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease.\n\nDocument 6 also touches on the use of bright light therapy in Parkinson's disease patients and its effects on clinical symptoms. Although not directly related to levodopa, it highlights potential non-pharmacological interventions for improving symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients.\n\nWhile the context documents provide information on the treatment of Parkinson's disease and potential therapies, they do not delve specifically into the detailed mechanism of action of levodopa itself. Additional biochemical and pharmacological studies would be needed to fully elucidate the precise mechanism by which levodopa functions in the brain to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.",

        "answer": "SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to have a significant impact on kidney function. Document 1 discusses the expanded indications for SGLT2 inhibitors to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. It mentions that the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors has increased over the years, with a notable increase in the number of tablets prescribed, especially for patients aged 75 years and older. This indicates that SGLT2 inhibitors are being more widely used, particularly in the elderly population who may have underlying kidney issues.\n\nDocument 3 also provides insight into the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function by discussing the chronic activation of the complement system and low-grade \"uremic inflammation\" in chronic kidney disease (CKD). It suggests that these factors can lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, indicating a potential link between SGLT2 inhibitors and mitigating the detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility in CKD.\n\nAdditionally, Document 7 from the Maastricht Study mentions that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and higher albuminuria levels are associated with worse physical performance, indicating a potential correlation between kidney function and physical capacity. This may suggest that interventions such as SGLT2 inhibitors that improve kidney function could have a positive impact on physical performance.\n\nWhile the documents provide information on the association between SGLT2 inhibitors and kidney function, they do not delve into specific mechanisms of action or detailed physiological changes induced by these inhibitors on the kidneys. Further studies focusing on the direct effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function, such as changes in glomerular filtration rate or albuminuria levels, would provide a more detailed understanding of how these medications affect kidney function.",

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress.

We used generalized estimating equation models to identify baseline lipid species associated with change in ABI and the Cox frailty regression to examine whether lipids associated with change in ABI were also associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD).

Baseline levels of 120 lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, fatty acids, and sphingomyelins, were associated with change in ABI. Among these, higher baseline levels of 3 known lipids (phosphatidylinositol[16:0/20:4], triacylglycerol[48:2], triacylglycerol[55:1]) were associated with a lower risk of CHD (hazard ratios [95% CIs] ranged from 0.67 [0.46\u20130.99] to 0.76 [0.58\u20130.99]), while cholesterol was associated with a higher risk of CHD (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.37 [1.00\u20131.87]).

This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use.

We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA.

        "answer": "Glucocorticoids are known to suppress inflammation through various mechanisms. Document 1 discusses the anti-inflammatory effects of fucoxanthin, which inhibits the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway, a key pathway involved in inflammatory responses. This inhibition of NF-\u03baB by fucoxanthin leads to the suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1 in THP-1 cells. Additionally, fucoxanthin exhibits antioxidant activity by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which upregulates heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This dual protective effect against inflammation and oxidative stress highlights the interconnected nature of these pathways in the context of glucocorticoid-like activity.\n\nDocument 4 introduces Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel compound with anti-inflammatory effects. MA was found to inhibit the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Specifically, MA acts on the Tyr405 site of phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), leading to the sustained elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Elevated cAMP subsequently inactivates the NF-\u03baB pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA), resulting in the suppression of inflammatory responses. This mechanism of action is similar to that of glucocorticoids, which also inhibit NF-\u03baB activation to suppress inflammation.\n\nWhile the documents provide insights into the mechanisms through which fucoxanthin and MA exert their anti-inflammatory effects, additional information on the specific interactions between glucocorticoids and their receptors, as well as the downstream signaling pathways involved in inflammation suppression, would further enhance the understanding of how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation.",

          "Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', metadata={}, id='2494')",

The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells.

In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions.

          "Document(page_content='Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine.

The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut\u2010off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut\u2010off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut\u2010off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\\u2009g/L). The neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%. The preoperative NLR shows some ability to predict acute infection after total joint arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Monitoring this ratio, perhaps in conjunction with other markers not analyzed here, may be useful for optimizing the timing of surgery in order to minimize risk of postoperative infection.', metadata={}, id='2336')",

        "answer": "Levodopa is a key medication used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). It works by being converted to dopamine in the brain, which helps to replenish the dopamine levels that are depleted due to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a key characteristic of PD. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in coordinating smooth muscle movements and is involved in the regulation of movement.\n\nDocument 1 discusses a study where patients with PD were treated with levodopa/carbidopa, which is a common combination therapy, to help manage the motor symptoms of the disease. The study aimed to assess the role of metformin as an adjuvant therapy in PD patients receiving levodopa/carbidopa. The focus of the study was on the assessment of clinical symptoms using the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the measurement of serum concentrations of various biomarkers before and after treatment. The results showed an improvement in UPDRS scores after treatment, suggesting some benefits of the therapy.\n\nOverall, while Document 1 does not specifically detail the mechanism of action of levodopa in PD, it highlights the importance of levodopa in managing the motor symptoms of the disease and the potential for additional therapies like metformin to provide neuroprotective effects.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided in the context documents, levodopa primarily acts by replenishing dopamine levels in the brain, which helps alleviate the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. Additional studies and research may provide further insights into the specific mechanisms of action of levodopa in PD.",

Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily for 3\u00a0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily and 500\u00a0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group). Patients were assessed via Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The serum concentrations of toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4), \u03b1-synuclein, brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) were measured before and after treatment.

          "Introduction Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS), as similarities in pathophysiology exist between the two. Adipokines are the key molecules that alter the adipose tissue metabolism and distribution, leading to MetS. This study was conducted to assess the levels of adipokines among patients with PCOS with and without MetS and to establish the role of adipokines as an early predictor for the development of MetS in PCOS. Materials and methods In this monocentric, tertiary hospital-based study, 144 patients with PCOS were selected and classified according to Rotterdam criteria and screened for MetS. Patients were grouped into MetS and non-MetS categories based on the presence of MetS. Adipokine levels (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin) were measured and compared, along with other biochemical and anthropological parameters. Data were analyzed using Jamovi statistical software, version 2.3 (Retrieved from  https://www.jamovi.org Results Out of the 144 patients included in the study, 58 were diagnosed with MetS and grouped as MetS. The prevalence of MetS was maximum among the non-PCO\u00a0(O+HA) phenotype\u00a0(53 out of 58). Significant differences\u00a0(p<0.001) in adipokines were observed between the MetS and non-MetS groups. Adiponectin, leptin, and resistin were found to have a significant role as predictors of MetS at an early stage of development of the syndrome, along with other common predictors. However, in later stages, fasting, blood glucose, waist circumference, and triglycerides remain significant predictors. Conclusion The present study reports a high prevalence of MetS among PCOS cases (40.27%). Altered adipokine levels may be significantly associated with the early stages of MetS development and\u00a0may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the management of MetS in PCOS. Therefore, the measurement of adipokines during preliminary investigations may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the\u00a0management of MetS in PCOS.",
          "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging."

          "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",

Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified 7.3 \u03bcg/L as the optimal GH peak cutoff to GST [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.15-8.91; sensitivity 95.7%, specificity 88.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) 88.0%, negative predictive value (NPV) 95.7%] able to correctly classify 91.8% of the entire cohort while 5.8 \u03bcg/L was the best GH peak cutoff able to correctly classify 91.4% of moderate organic GHD patients (95% CI 3.16-7.39; sensitivity 96.0%, specificity 80.0%, PPV 92.3%, NPV 88.9%). Patients with \u22653 hormone deficiencies showed a GH peak <5 \u03bcg/L at ITT and <5.8 \u03bcg/L at GST but 1. The optimal cutoff for IGF-1 was \u22121.4 SD score (95% CI \u22121.94 to 0.77; sensitivity 75%, specificity 94%, PPV 91.7%, NPV 81.0%) that correctly classified 85.1% of the study population. A GH peak to GST <5.8 \u03bcg/L represents an accurate diagnostic cutoff for young adults with childhood-onset GHD and high pretest probability of permanent GHD."

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan.

          "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world.

          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.",
          "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.",
          "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity\u2013response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.",

          "Metabolic surgery, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), may improve hypertension (HTN) complicated by severe obesity; however, insufficient deliberation exists regarding the therapeutic effect of post-metabolic surgery on HTN. This study aimed to analyze the factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG in patients who have severe obesity, and to create a classification system to predict HTN remission and recurrence. Of the 102 patients who underwent LSG at Iwate Medical University Hospital between 2008 and 2020, 62 were enrolled in this study. Factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG were retrospectively analyzed. The HTN remission rate 12-months post-LSG was 40.3%. The remission cohort had a lower number of preoperative antihypertensive drugs (ADs) than that of the non-remission cohort (one and two tablets, respectively; p< 0.001). Additionally, the remission cohort had a statistically significantly smaller visceral fat area (VFA) than that of the non-remission cohort, at all time points. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were independent predictors of remission. The HTN recurrence rate 36-months post-LSG was 36.0%. In the recurrence cohort, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were higher and larger than that in the non-recurrence cohort, respectively. Stratification, based on the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, revealed that the HTN remission and recurrence rates in the sub-cohort with a small number of preoperative ADs and small VFA (100% and 16.7%, respectively) were better than those in the sub-cohort with a large number of preoperative ADs and large VFA (5.3% and 100%, respectively). In Japanese patients with severe obesity, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG. Stratification, by combining the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, may be useful in predicting HTN remission and recurrence.",

          "Lipid droplets (LDs) serve as crucial hubs for lipid trafficking and metabolic regulation through their numerous interactions with various organelles. While the interplay between LDs and the Golgi apparatus has been recognized, their roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the role of Ras-related protein Rab-2A (Rab2A) in mediating LD-Golgi interactions, thereby contributing to very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipidation and secretion in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, our findings identify a selective interaction between Golgi-localized Rab2A and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) protein residing on LDs. This complex facilitates dynamic organelle communication between the Golgi apparatus and LDs, thus contributing to lipid transfer from LDs to the Golgi apparatus for VLDL2 lipidation and secretion. Attenuation of Rab2A activity via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses the Rab2A-HSD17B13 complex formation, impairing LD-Golgi interactions and subsequent VLDL secretion. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Rab2A and HSD17B13 in the liver reduces the serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Collectively, this study provides a new perspective on the interactions between the Golgi apparatus and LDs.",
          "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases.

          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",
          "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype.

          "Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials."

          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.",
          "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.",
          "Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) remains a rare congenital disorder with a wide range of manifestations. The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included \u201cheart failure\u201d, \u201cccTGA\u201d, \u201cVAD\u201d, \u201cheart transplantation\u201d, and \u201csystemic RV failure\u201d. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.",

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.",

          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",
          "Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.",
          "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.",
          "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment.

          "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype.

Nineteen participants with healthy implants restored with titanium or gold-casting abutment were included. PICF and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were collected for inflammatory cytokine detection by ELISA. Cytokine levels in PICF or GCF of the same individual were compared using the paired t-test, and those from titanium or gold-casting (UCLA) abutment were compared using the independent t-test. Human gingival fibroblast responses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3 expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same individual. However, IL-1\u03b2 (p = 0.032) and IL-1\u03b1 (p = 0.030) was statistically significantly higher in PICF than in GCF. IL-8 level was statistically significantly higher with gold-casting than with titanium abutments (p = 0.003). PICF statistically significantly stimulated higher expression of RANKL, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF), while focal adhesion kinase (FAK) suppressed mRNA. The inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, are higher in healthy peri-implant tissues. Abutment materials may also influence the level of inflammatory cytokines in PICF.

          "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",
          "Secondary lymphedema is a common complication following surgical treatment of solid tumors. Although more prevalent in women due to higher breast cancer rates, men also develop lymphedema, often with more severe manifestations. Despite these differences in clinical presentation, the cellular mechanisms underlying sex differences are poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression by inflammatory cells is an important regulator of lymphatic pumping and leakiness in lymphedema and that lymphatic endothelial cells are highly sensitive to nitrosative stress. Based on this rationale, we used a mouse tail model of lymphedema to study the role of nitric oxide in sex-related differences in disease severity. Consistent with clinical findings, we found that male mice have significantly worse tail edema and higher rates of tail necrosis compared with female mice following tail skin/lymphatic excision (p = 0.001). Our findings correlated with increased tissue infiltration of iNOS + inflammatory cells, increased iNOS protein expression, and increased nitrosative stress in male mouse lymphedematous skin tissues (p < 0.05). Importantly, transgenic male mice lacking the iNOS gene (iNOS-KO) displayed markedly reduced swelling, inflammation, and tissue necrosis rates, whereas no differences were observed between wild-type and iNOS-KO female mice. Overall, our results indicate that iNOS-mediated nitric oxide production contributes to sex-based differences in secondary lymphedema severity, emphasizing the need to consider sex as a biological variable in lymphedema research.",

Current research on the presence of ARGs in microorganisms focuses mainly on humans, livestock, hospitals, or wastewater. However, the spectrum of ARGs in the dust resistome in workplaces and households has gone relatively unexplored. This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants\u2019 workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.",

Meanwhile, transcription factor engineering can trigger metabolic network reprogramming at the global or systemic level, redirecting metabolic flux toward the synthetic pathways of target metabolites. In this study, we modulated pyrimidine and carbon-nitrogen metabolism in  Bacillus subtilis First, cytidine synthesis was enhanced by knocking out the transcriptional regulator PyrR, which increased the cytidine titer during shake flask fermentation to 0.67\u00a0g/L. Second, mutations in the transcriptional regulator catabolite control protein A (CcpA) significantly promoted cytidine synthesis, increasing the shake flask titer to 2.03\u00a0g/L. Finally, after culture in a 5\u00a0L fermenter, the cytidine titer reached 7.65\u00a0g/L, which was 3.77-fold that of shake flask fermentation. Moreover, a cytidine yield and productivity of 0.06\u00a0g/g glucose and 0.16\u00a0g/L/h, respectively, were achieved. Subsequently, the regulatory mechanisms through which PyrR and CcpA modification affect cytidine biosynthesis were explored through multi-omics analysis. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that coordinated alterations in carbon, nitrogen, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism were essential to promote cytidine synthesis. However, the increased cytidine production in recombinant strains was attributed to the enhancement of pyrimidine metabolism, the Phosphotransferase (PTS) system, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, and nitrogen metabolism. These results indicate that PyrR knockdown can enhance pyrimidine metabolic pathway and promote cytidine synthesis.

Among 2321 patients who started b/tsDMARDs between 2010 and 2023, we focused on 295 patients who had knee swelling or tenderness at the initiation of b/tsDMARDs and continued b/tsDMARDs at least 3 months, with recorded knee symptoms 6 months later. Symptom relief after 6 months was 78.2% for interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitors, 68.6% for Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, 65.8% for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and 57.6% for cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-Ig (CTLA4-Ig). The initial use of b/tsDMARDs and the use of IL-6 inhibitors in comparison to CTLA4-Ig emerged as a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms. Among 141 patients who underwent knee radiography at baseline and two years later, the deterioration in knee joint radiographs was 7.7% for IL-6 inhibitors, 6.3% for JAK inhibitors, 21.9% for TNF inhibitors, and 25.9% for CTLA4-Ig.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA and AS patients were treated with UA, and cell viability was measured using the MTS assay and flow cytometry. The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of \u22125.251 kcal/mol and \u22126.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients. In the arthritis mouse model, significantly reduced clinical and histological scores were observed in the UA treatment group. Our findings suggest that UA has potential as a binding target for TNF, suppresses inflammatory cytokines in PBMCs, and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on arthritis in a mouse model.",
          "Preoperative levels of certain inflammatory markers in the blood can predict acute infection after primary total joint arthroplasty in patients without inflammatory disease, but whether they can do so in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut\u2010off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio, C\u2010reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020. We compared preoperative levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) between patients who suffered acute infection or not within 90\u2009days after surgery. The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut\u2010off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut\u2010off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut\u2010off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L). The neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%.

          "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",
          "Recombinant monoclonal therapeutic antibodies like lecanemab, which target amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease, offer a promising approach for modifying the disease progression. Due to its relatively short half\u2010life, lecanemab administered as a bi\u2010monthly infusion (typically 10\u2009mg/kg) has a relatively brief half\u2010life. Interaction with abundant plasma proteins binder in the bloodstream can affect pharmacokinetics of drugs, including their half\u2010life. In this study, we investigated potential plasma protein binding (PPB) interaction to lecanemab using lecanemab biosimilar. Lecanemab biosimilar used in this study was based on publicly available sequences. ELISA and western blotting were used to assess lecanemab biosimilar immunoreactivity in the fractions of human plasma obtained through size exclusion chromatography. The binding of lecanemab biosimilar to candidate plasma binders was confirmed by western blotting, ELISA, and surface plasmon resonance analysis. Using a combination of equilibrium dialysis, ELISA, and western blotting in human plasma, we first describe the presence of likely PPB partners to lecanemab biosimilar and then identify fibrinogen as one of them. Utilizing surface plasmon resonance, we confirmed that lecanemab biosimilar does bind to fibrinogen, although with lower affinity than to monomeric amyloid beta. In the context of lecanemab therapy, these results imply that fibrinogen levels could impact the levels of free antibodies in the bloodstream and that fibrinogen might serve as a reservoir for lecanemab. More broadly, these results indicate that PPB may be an important consideration when clinically utilizing therapeutic antibodies in neurodegenerative disease.",

We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL.

The limited efficacy could be due to regional differences in the dysregulation of the dopamine system. This study investigated striatal and peripheral dopaminergic makers in schizophrenia and their relationship with cognitive impairment. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated. We evaluated their cognitive performance, examined the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT, and measured plasma levels of dopaminergic precursors (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) that compete with precursors for brain uptake via ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Schizophrenia patients exhibited lower cognitive performance, decreased striatal DAT availability, and reduced levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA. Within the patient group, lower DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen was positively associated with attention deficits. Meanwhile, lower tyrosine levels and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA were positively related to executive dysfunction. Among all participants, DAT availability in the right CN or putamen was positively related to memory function, and plasma phenylalanine level was positively associated with executive function. This study supports the role of dopamine system abnormalities in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The distinct associations between different dopaminergic alterations and specific cognitive domain impairments suggest the potential need for multifaceted treatment approaches to target these impairments.",

Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP).

          "In severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), sedatives are often used to control intracranial pressure (ICP), to reduce brain metabolism, to allow for other treatments such as mechanical ventilation or targeted temperature management, or to control paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\u00a0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\u00a0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\u00a0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\u00a0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points.

Hence, for the purpose of gaining a deeper comprehension of the structure of CathD, the present computational investigation was performed using virtual screening technique to predict CathD's active site residues and substrate binding mode. Ligand-based virtual screening was implemented on small molecules from ZINC database against crystal structure of CathD. Further, molecular docking was utilised to investigate the binding mechanism of CathD with substrates and virtually screened inhibitors. Localised compounds obtained through screening performed by PyRx and AutoDock 4.2 with CathD receptor and the compounds having highest binding affinities were picked as; ZINC00601317, ZINC04214975 and ZINCC12500925 as our top choices.

          "Tic disorders represent a developmental neuropsychiatric condition whose causes can be attributed to a variety of environmental, neurobiological, and genetic factors. From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In this paper, therefore, we summarize the evidence to date on these abnormalities with the intent to illustrate and clarify the main neuroanatomical differences between patients with tic disorders and healthy individuals.",
          "Previous studies have shown an association between the thalamocortical dysconnectivity and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Whether a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine may change thalamocortical connectivity among patients with TRD is unclear. Whether these changes in thalamocortical connectivity is associated with the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine treatment is also unclear. Two resting-state functional MRIs were collected in two clinical trials of 48 patients with TRD (clinical trial 1; 32 receiving ketamine, 16 receiving a normal saline placebo) and 48 patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation (clinical trial 2; 24 receiving ketamine, 24 receiving midazolam), respectively. All participants underwent rs-fMRI before and 3 days after infusion. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) was analyzed in the left/right thalamus. FCs between the bilateral thalamus and right middle frontal cortex (BA46) and between the left thalamus and left anterior paracingulate gyrus (BA8) increased among patients in the ketamine group in clinical trials 1 and 2, respectively. FCs between the right thalamus and bilateral frontal pole (BA9) and between the right thalamus and left rostral paracingulate gyrus (BA10) decreased among patients in the ketamine group in clinical trials 1 and 2, respectively. However, the associations between those FC changes and clinical symptom changes did not survive statistical significance after multiple comparison corrections. Whether ketamine-related changes in thalamocortical connectivity may be associated with ketamine\u2019s antidepressant and antisuicidal effects would need further investigation.

The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects.

Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30).

          "We report the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy with a history of recurrent and severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy with an uncommon clinical presentation. This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

          "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.",
          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients."

          "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01).

          "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity\u2013response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.",

While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes."

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01).

This study aimed to analyze the factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG in patients who have severe obesity, and to create a classification system to predict HTN remission and recurrence. Of the 102 patients who underwent LSG at Iwate Medical University Hospital between 2008 and 2020, 62 were enrolled in this study. Factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG were retrospectively analyzed. The HTN remission rate 12-months post-LSG was 40.3%. The remission cohort had a lower number of preoperative antihypertensive drugs (ADs) than that of the non-remission cohort (one and two tablets, respectively; p< 0.001). Additionally, the remission cohort had a statistically significantly smaller visceral fat area (VFA) than that of the non-remission cohort, at all time points. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were independent predictors of remission. The HTN recurrence rate 36-months post-LSG was 36.0%. In the recurrence cohort, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were higher and larger than that in the non-recurrence cohort, respectively. Stratification, based on the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, revealed that the HTN remission and recurrence rates in the sub-cohort with a small number of preoperative ADs and small VFA (100% and 16.7%, respectively) were better than those in the sub-cohort with a large number of preoperative ADs and large VFA (5.3% and 100%, respectively). In Japanese patients with severe obesity, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG.

One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.",
          "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a form of severe acute stroke with very high mortality and disability rates. Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.",
          "Bone is a dynamic organ which continuously undergoes remodeling throughout one's lifetime. Cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential for regulating bone homeostasis. Osteoclasts, multinucleated giant cells differentiated from macrophage lineage, are responsible for osteolytic bone conditions which are closely linked to ROS signaling pathways. In this study, an anti\u2010ROS enzyme, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) was found to be expressed both in bone marrow macrophages and osteoclasts. Recombinant Prdx1 protein was found to dose\u2010dependently inhibit ROS production and osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, Prdx1 protein also attenuated NFATc1 activation as well as the expression of C\u2010Fos, V\u2010ATPase\u2010d2, Cathepsin K, and Integrin \u03b1V. Collectively, Prdx1 is a negative regulator on osteoclast formation via inhibiting RANKL\u2010mediated ROS activity, thus suggesting its potential application for treating osteoclast related disorders.",
          "The clinical impact of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is still controversial. To evaluate the 1-year risk of all-cause death, thromboembolic events, and bleeding in patients with AF-NAFLD. Retrospective study with a health research network (TriNetX). Patients with AF on oral anticoagulation (OAC) were categorized according to the presence of NAFLD into 2 groups. The primary outcomes were the 1-year risks of (1) a composite cardiovascular outcome (all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, and pulmonary embolism) and (2) a composite hemorrhagic outcome (intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding). Cox regression analysis before and after propensity score matching was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 95% CI,. Sensitivity analyses investigated the risk associated with cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and type of OAC (warfarin vs non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). We identified 22 636 patients with AF-NAFLD (69 \u00b1 12 years, 46.7% females) and 391 014 patients with AF and without liver disease (72 \u00b1 12 years, 42.7% females). NAFLD was associated with a higher risk of composite cardiovascular (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.47-1.61) and hemorrhagic (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.42-1.72) outcomes. This was consistent also for all the single outcomes. Cirrhotic and thrombocytopenic patients with AF-NAFLD showed the highest risks. Compared to patients with AF-NAFLD on NOACs, those on warfarin were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular and hemorrhagic outcomes. In patients with AF, NAFLD is associated with a higher 1-year risk of adverse events, with the risk of adverse events progressively increasing from noncirrhotic to cirrhotic and from nonthrombocytopenic to thrombocytopenic patients. NOACs were associated with a better effectiveness and safety profile compared to warfarin.",
          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",
          "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.",
          "Lipid droplets (LDs) serve as crucial hubs for lipid trafficking and metabolic regulation through their numerous interactions with various organelles. While the interplay between LDs and the Golgi apparatus has been recognized, their roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the role of Ras-related protein Rab-2A (Rab2A) in mediating LD-Golgi interactions, thereby contributing to very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipidation and secretion in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, our findings identify a selective interaction between Golgi-localized Rab2A and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) protein residing on LDs. This complex facilitates dynamic organelle communication between the Golgi apparatus and LDs, thus contributing to lipid transfer from LDs to the Golgi apparatus for VLDL2 lipidation and secretion. Attenuation of Rab2A activity via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses the Rab2A-HSD17B13 complex formation, impairing LD-Golgi interactions and subsequent VLDL secretion. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Rab2A and HSD17B13 in the liver reduces the serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Collectively, this study provides a new perspective on the interactions between the Golgi apparatus and LDs.",

They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease. In this review, we summarize the effects of GLP-1 and incretin-based therapeutics on gastric, biliary and small intestinal function. An improved understanding of these effects will optimize the use of these drugs."

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.",
          "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.",
          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.",

The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included \u201cheart failure\u201d, \u201cccTGA\u201d, \u201cVAD\u201d, \u201cheart transplantation\u201d, and \u201csystemic RV failure\u201d. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.",

          "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.",
          "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype.

IL-8 level was statistically significantly higher with gold-casting than with titanium abutments (p = 0.003). PICF statistically significantly stimulated higher expression of RANKL, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF), while focal adhesion kinase (FAK) suppressed mRNA. The inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, are higher in healthy peri-implant tissues. Abutment materials may also influence the level of inflammatory cytokines in PICF.

          "Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.",

Pooled data from two phase III osilodrostat studies (LINC 3 and LINC 4) were analyzed. Both comprised a 48-week core phase and an optional open-label extension. Changes in cardiovascular/metabolic-related parameters, physical manifestations of hypercortisolism, and quality of life (QoL) were evaluated across the following patient subgroups: both LNSC and mUFC controlled, only mUFC controlled, only LNSC controlled, and neither controlled. Of 160 patients included in the analysis, 85.0% had both LNSC and mUFC uncontrolled at baseline. At week 72, 48.6% of patients had both LNSC and mUFC controlled; these patients generally exhibited greater improvements in cardiovascular/metabolic-related parameters than those with only mUFC controlled or both LNSC and mUFC uncontrolled: systolic/diastolic blood pressure, \u22127.4%/\u22124.9%, \u22126.0%/\u22125.5%, and 2.3%/0.8%, respectively; fasting plasma glucose, \u22125.0%, \u22124.8%, and 1.9%; glycated hemoglobin, \u22125.1%, \u22124.8%, and \u22121.3%. Weight, waist circumference, and body mass index improved with control of LNSC and/or mUFC; physical manifestations of hypercortisolism generally improved regardless of LNSC/mUFC control. Patients with both LNSC and mUFC controlled or only mUFC controlled had the greatest improvement from baseline to week 72 in QoL. In osilodrostat-treated patients with Cushing disease, normalization of LNSC and mUFC led to improvements in long-term outcomes, indicating that treatment should aim for normalization of both parameters for optimal patient outcomes.

However, the spectrum of ARGs in the dust resistome in workplaces and households has gone relatively unexplored. This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants\u2019 workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.",

This study introduces a novel method, ribosomal RNA-derived cDNA depletion (RiboD), seamlessly integrated into the PETRI-seq technique, yielding RiboD-PETRI. This innovative approach offers a cost-effective, equipment-free, and high-throughput solution for bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). By efficiently eliminating rRNA reads and substantially enhancing mRNA detection rates (up to 92%), our method enables precise exploration of bacterial population heterogeneity. Applying RiboD-PETRI to investigate biofilm heterogeneity, distinctive subpopulations marked by unique genes within biofilms were successfully identified. Notably, PdeI, a marker for the cell-surface attachment subpopulation, was observed to elevate cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) levels, promoting persister cell formation. Thus, we address a persistent challenge in bacterial single-cell RNA-seq regarding rRNA abundance, exemplifying the utility of this method in exploring biofilm heterogeneity. Our method effectively tackles a long-standing issue in bacterial scRNA-seq: the overwhelming abundance of rRNA. This advancement significantly enhances our ability to investigate the intricate heterogeneity within biofilms at unprecedented resolution.",

Meanwhile, transcription factor engineering can trigger metabolic network reprogramming at the global or systemic level, redirecting metabolic flux toward the synthetic pathways of target metabolites. In this study, we modulated pyrimidine and carbon-nitrogen metabolism in  Bacillus subtilis First, cytidine synthesis was enhanced by knocking out the transcriptional regulator PyrR, which increased the cytidine titer during shake flask fermentation to 0.67\u00a0g/L. Second, mutations in the transcriptional regulator catabolite control protein A (CcpA) significantly promoted cytidine synthesis, increasing the shake flask titer to 2.03\u00a0g/L. Finally, after culture in a 5\u00a0L fermenter, the cytidine titer reached 7.65\u00a0g/L, which was 3.77-fold that of shake flask fermentation. Moreover, a cytidine yield and productivity of 0.06\u00a0g/g glucose and 0.16\u00a0g/L/h, respectively, were achieved. Subsequently, the regulatory mechanisms through which PyrR and CcpA modification affect cytidine biosynthesis were explored through multi-omics analysis. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that coordinated alterations in carbon, nitrogen, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism were essential to promote cytidine synthesis. However, the increased cytidine production in recombinant strains was attributed to the enhancement of pyrimidine metabolism, the Phosphotransferase (PTS) system, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, and nitrogen metabolism. These results indicate that PyrR knockdown can enhance pyrimidine metabolic pathway and promote cytidine synthesis.

One of them is fibrin clot\u2013augmented meniscal repair, which will be described in this video. This technique is indicated mainly for the lesions with a high failure rate. This includes large, horizontal, and radial tears and even for meniscal cysts, especially in a stable knee. This technique can also be used in revision meniscal suture when failure is no longer an option. Fibrin clot is prepared from sterile peripheral venous blood from the patient. A plastic syringe is used to stir the blood in a sterile glass container. The fibrin clot is then formed and washed rigorously with saline solution. Rolling the fibrin clot which is fixed to the syringe allows to give the fibrillar aspect of the clot. The formed fibrin clot is now solid enough to be manipulated and can be fixed to a vicryl suture thread allowing it to enter the knee and be fixed inside the meniscal lesion. The clot is wrapped inside the meniscal lesion with inside-out or outside-in suture technique.

However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS."

Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily for 3\u00a0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily and 500\u00a0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group).

          "Cognitive impairment, a major determinant of poor functioning in schizophrenia, had limited responses to existing antipsychotic drugs. The limited efficacy could be due to regional differences in the dysregulation of the dopamine system. This study investigated striatal and peripheral dopaminergic makers in schizophrenia and their relationship with cognitive impairment. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated. We evaluated their cognitive performance, examined the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT, and measured plasma levels of dopaminergic precursors (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) that compete with precursors for brain uptake via ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Schizophrenia patients exhibited lower cognitive performance, decreased striatal DAT availability, and reduced levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA. Within the patient group, lower DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen was positively associated with attention deficits. Meanwhile, lower tyrosine levels and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA were positively related to executive dysfunction. Among all participants, DAT availability in the right CN or putamen was positively related to memory function, and plasma phenylalanine level was positively associated with executive function. This study supports the role of dopamine system abnormalities in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The distinct associations between different dopaminergic alterations and specific cognitive domain impairments suggest the potential need for multifaceted treatment approaches to target these impairments.",
          "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an efficient treatment for movement disorders, most commonly Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), dystonia and essential tremor. DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.",
          "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia caused by the accumulation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptides. The extracellular deposition of A\u03b2 peptides in human AD brain causes neuronal death. Therefore, it has been found that A\u03b2 peptide degradation is a possible therapeutic target for AD. CathD has been known to breakdown amyloid beta peptides. However, the structural role of CathD is not yet clear. Hence, for the purpose of gaining a deeper comprehension of the structure of CathD, the present computational investigation was performed using virtual screening technique to predict CathD's active site residues and substrate binding mode. Ligand-based virtual screening was implemented on small molecules from ZINC database against crystal structure of CathD. Further, molecular docking was utilised to investigate the binding mechanism of CathD with substrates and virtually screened inhibitors.

          "In severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), sedatives are often used to control intracranial pressure (ICP), to reduce brain metabolism, to allow for other treatments such as mechanical ventilation or targeted temperature management, or to control paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\u00a0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\u00a0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\u00a0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\u00a0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points. This study is the first prospective RCT to investigate the safety of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in TBI patients.

Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (\u0394scales), OCT (\u0394retinal thickness), PERG (\u0394PERG values) and VEP (\u0394P100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral \u0394N95 latencies for PERG and \u0394P100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT.

Whether a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine may change thalamocortical connectivity among patients with TRD is unclear. Whether these changes in thalamocortical connectivity is associated with the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine treatment is also unclear. Two resting-state functional MRIs were collected in two clinical trials of 48 patients with TRD (clinical trial 1; 32 receiving ketamine, 16 receiving a normal saline placebo) and 48 patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation (clinical trial 2; 24 receiving ketamine, 24 receiving midazolam), respectively. All participants underwent rs-fMRI before and 3 days after infusion. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) was analyzed in the left/right thalamus. FCs between the bilateral thalamus and right middle frontal cortex (BA46) and between the left thalamus and left anterior paracingulate gyrus (BA8) increased among patients in the ketamine group in clinical trials 1 and 2, respectively. FCs between the right thalamus and bilateral frontal pole (BA9) and between the right thalamus and left rostral paracingulate gyrus (BA10) decreased among patients in the ketamine group in clinical trials 1 and 2, respectively.

          "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients.

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques.

          "Introduction Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS), as similarities in pathophysiology exist between the two. Adipokines are the key molecules that alter the adipose tissue metabolism and distribution, leading to MetS. This study was conducted to assess the levels of adipokines among patients with PCOS with and without MetS and to establish the role of adipokines as an early predictor for the development of MetS in PCOS. Materials and methods In this monocentric, tertiary hospital-based study, 144 patients with PCOS were selected and classified according to Rotterdam criteria and screened for MetS. Patients were grouped into MetS and non-MetS categories based on the presence of MetS. Adipokine levels (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin) were measured and compared, along with other biochemical and anthropological parameters. Data were analyzed using Jamovi statistical software, version 2.3 (Retrieved from  https://www.jamovi.org Results Out of the 144 patients included in the study, 58 were diagnosed with MetS and grouped as MetS. The prevalence of MetS was maximum among the non-PCO\u00a0(O+HA) phenotype\u00a0(53 out of 58). Significant differences\u00a0(p<0.001) in adipokines were observed between the MetS and non-MetS groups. Adiponectin, leptin, and resistin were found to have a significant role as predictors of MetS at an early stage of development of the syndrome, along with other common predictors. However, in later stages, fasting, blood glucose, waist circumference, and triglycerides remain significant predictors. Conclusion The present study reports a high prevalence of MetS among PCOS cases (40.27%). Altered adipokine levels may be significantly associated with the early stages of MetS development and\u00a0may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the management of MetS in PCOS. Therefore, the measurement of adipokines during preliminary investigations may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the\u00a0management of MetS in PCOS.",

The literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus, and the selected articles were evaluated for eligibility based on predefined criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale. Statistical analysis was performed to calculate effect sizes and assess heterogeneity among the studies. This review analyzed 29 out of 1,986 studies, conducted between 2005 and 2022, with participants from multiple countries. Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with age and gender, while associations with hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria were inconsistent. In the meta-analyses, a correlation between serum Gd-IgA1 and estimated glomerular filtration rate was identified, however, the relationships between Gd-IgA1 levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage and progression to kidney failure were inconsistent. Serum Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with validated prognostic risk factors, but were negatively correlated with kidney function. Further research in larger studies using standardized assays are needed to establish the value of Gd-IgA1 as a prognostic risk factor in IgAN. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40620-023-01874-8.",

The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

          "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity\u2013response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.",

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

The aim was to identify any association between timing of PCSK9i mAb initiation after a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and the rate of subsequent MACE. A retrospective cohort study of adult patients in the United States with a MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) from January 1, 2017 to February 28, 2022 was conducted using administrative claims databases (index date = first observed MACE during this period). Patients were required to have \u2265360 days of data visibility prior to (baseline period) and for \u226530 days after the index date (minimum, variable follow up period), and \u22651 prescription claim for PCSK9i mAb therapy on or after the index date. Subsequent MACE rates, time from index MACE to PCSK9i mAb initiation, and time to subsequent MACE were reported. A total of 58,997 patients with \u22651 MACE were identified (mean age = 64 years; 58% male; median follow up=1,241 days). Over half of the patients did not initiate a PCSK9i mAb in the first year after the index MACE. Overall, 35% (n = 20,465) had \u22651 subsequent MACE. Compared to the period between index MACE and prior to PCSK9i mAb initiation, rates of subsequent MACE after PCSK9i mAb initiation were reduced in a time-dependent manner by 70% among patients who initiated PCSK9i mAb therapy within 30 days, 78% (31\u201390 days), 76% (91\u2013180 days), 65% (181\u2013360 days), and 42% (>360 days) after the index MACE. Those who initiated PCSK9i mAb within 30 days of the index MACE had longer median time to the first subsequent MACE (111 days) compared to patients who initiated at later times. This study provides evidence that earlier initiation of PCSK9i mAb therapy after a MACE appeared to be associated with longer time to a subsequent MACE. Patients without timely treatment are left at an unnecessarily elevated risk of further MACE.",

          "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01).

          "Metabolic surgery, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), may improve hypertension (HTN) complicated by severe obesity; however, insufficient deliberation exists regarding the therapeutic effect of post-metabolic surgery on HTN. This study aimed to analyze the factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG in patients who have severe obesity, and to create a classification system to predict HTN remission and recurrence. Of the 102 patients who underwent LSG at Iwate Medical University Hospital between 2008 and 2020, 62 were enrolled in this study. Factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG were retrospectively analyzed. The HTN remission rate 12-months post-LSG was 40.3%. The remission cohort had a lower number of preoperative antihypertensive drugs (ADs) than that of the non-remission cohort (one and two tablets, respectively; p< 0.001). Additionally, the remission cohort had a statistically significantly smaller visceral fat area (VFA) than that of the non-remission cohort, at all time points. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were independent predictors of remission. The HTN recurrence rate 36-months post-LSG was 36.0%. In the recurrence cohort, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were higher and larger than that in the non-recurrence cohort, respectively. Stratification, based on the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, revealed that the HTN remission and recurrence rates in the sub-cohort with a small number of preoperative ADs and small VFA (100% and 16.7%, respectively) were better than those in the sub-cohort with a large number of preoperative ADs and large VFA (5.3% and 100%, respectively). In Japanese patients with severe obesity, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG. Stratification, by combining the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, may be useful in predicting HTN remission and recurrence.",
          "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity\u2013response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.",
          "The clinical impact of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is still controversial. To evaluate the 1-year risk of all-cause death, thromboembolic events, and bleeding in patients with AF-NAFLD. Retrospective study with a health research network (TriNetX). Patients with AF on oral anticoagulation (OAC) were categorized according to the presence of NAFLD into 2 groups. The primary outcomes were the 1-year risks of (1) a composite cardiovascular outcome (all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, and pulmonary embolism) and (2) a composite hemorrhagic outcome (intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding). Cox regression analysis before and after propensity score matching was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 95% CI,. Sensitivity analyses investigated the risk associated with cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and type of OAC (warfarin vs non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). We identified 22 636 patients with AF-NAFLD (69 \u00b1 12 years, 46.7% females) and 391 014 patients with AF and without liver disease (72 \u00b1 12 years, 42.7% females). NAFLD was associated with a higher risk of composite cardiovascular (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.47-1.61) and hemorrhagic (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.42-1.72) outcomes. This was consistent also for all the single outcomes. Cirrhotic and thrombocytopenic patients with AF-NAFLD showed the highest risks. Compared to patients with AF-NAFLD on NOACs, those on warfarin were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular and hemorrhagic outcomes. In patients with AF, NAFLD is associated with a higher 1-year risk of adverse events, with the risk of adverse events progressively increasing from noncirrhotic to cirrhotic and from nonthrombocytopenic to thrombocytopenic patients. NOACs were associated with a better effectiveness and safety profile compared to warfarin."

          "Lipid droplets (LDs) serve as crucial hubs for lipid trafficking and metabolic regulation through their numerous interactions with various organelles. While the interplay between LDs and the Golgi apparatus has been recognized, their roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the role of Ras-related protein Rab-2A (Rab2A) in mediating LD-Golgi interactions, thereby contributing to very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipidation and secretion in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, our findings identify a selective interaction between Golgi-localized Rab2A and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) protein residing on LDs. This complex facilitates dynamic organelle communication between the Golgi apparatus and LDs, thus contributing to lipid transfer from LDs to the Golgi apparatus for VLDL2 lipidation and secretion. Attenuation of Rab2A activity via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses the Rab2A-HSD17B13 complex formation, impairing LD-Golgi interactions and subsequent VLDL secretion. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Rab2A and HSD17B13 in the liver reduces the serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Collectively, this study provides a new perspective on the interactions between the Golgi apparatus and LDs.",
          "Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.",
          "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a form of severe acute stroke with very high mortality and disability rates. Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.",

          "Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a common cardiovascular condition marked by peripheral artery stenosis or occlusion. Despite treatment advancements, patients will still face vascular complications, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Human proteins play crucial roles in biology and drug research. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",

The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included \u201cheart failure\u201d, \u201cccTGA\u201d, \u201cVAD\u201d, \u201cheart transplantation\u201d, and \u201csystemic RV failure\u201d. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.",

          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",
          "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",
          "Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.",
          "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.",

However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited.

Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype.

Cytokine levels in PICF or GCF of the same individual were compared using the paired t-test, and those from titanium or gold-casting (UCLA) abutment were compared using the independent t-test. Human gingival fibroblast responses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3 expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same individual. However, IL-1\u03b2 (p = 0.032) and IL-1\u03b1 (p = 0.030) was statistically significantly higher in PICF than in GCF. IL-8 level was statistically significantly higher with gold-casting than with titanium abutments (p = 0.003). PICF statistically significantly stimulated higher expression of RANKL, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF), while focal adhesion kinase (FAK) suppressed mRNA. The inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, are higher in healthy peri-implant tissues. Abutment materials may also influence the level of inflammatory cytokines in PICF.

Symptom relief after 6 months was 78.2% for interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitors, 68.6% for Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, 65.8% for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and 57.6% for cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-Ig (CTLA4-Ig). The initial use of b/tsDMARDs and the use of IL-6 inhibitors in comparison to CTLA4-Ig emerged as a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms. Among 141 patients who underwent knee radiography at baseline and two years later, the deterioration in knee joint radiographs was 7.7% for IL-6 inhibitors, 6.3% for JAK inhibitors, 21.9% for TNF inhibitors, and 25.9% for CTLA4-Ig. The use of IL-6 inhibitors was a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms and the inhibition of joint destruction compared to CTLA4-Ig.",
          "Usenamine A (UA) is a natural compound isolated from the lichen  Usnea diffracta Molecular docking was performed between the 3D structure of UA and the TNF-TNFR2 complex. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA and AS patients were treated with UA, and cell viability was measured using the MTS assay and flow cytometry. The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of \u22125.251 kcal/mol and \u22126.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients. In the arthritis mouse model, significantly reduced clinical and histological scores were observed in the UA treatment group. Our findings suggest that UA has potential as a binding target for TNF, suppresses inflammatory cytokines in PBMCs, and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on arthritis in a mouse model.",
          "Preoperative levels of certain inflammatory markers in the blood can predict acute infection after primary total joint arthroplasty in patients without inflammatory disease, but whether they can do so in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut\u2010off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio, C\u2010reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020. We compared preoperative levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) between patients who suffered acute infection or not within 90\u2009days after surgery. The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut\u2010off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut\u2010off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut\u2010off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L). The neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%. The preoperative NLR shows some ability to predict acute infection after total joint arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Monitoring this ratio, perhaps in conjunction with other markers not analyzed here, may be useful for optimizing the timing of surgery in order to minimize risk of postoperative infection.",
          "Patients infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) often present with rheumatic symptoms, but its link to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unclear. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate whether HCV infection is related to the risk for RA in adults. We analyzed data from the 2017\u20132020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). HCV infection and RA status were determined through questionnaires. Covariates included gender, age, race, marital status, body mass index (BMI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and diabetes status. Multivariate logistic regression and subgroup analyses were used to assess the relationship between HCV infection and RA risk. In this population-based study involving 5,825 participants aged 18\u201380 years (including 485 RA patients), we observed a significantly higher prevalence of HCV infection in the RA group compared with non-RA controls. After adjusting for covariates, multivariate logistic regression showed that HCV infection was associated with an increased risk of RA (OR\u2009=\u20091.93; 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.07\u20133.50,  p This study demonstrates that HCV infection is associated with the risk of RA in adults, underscoring the potential value of HCV screening in RA patients for improved disease management.

          "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.",
          "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.",

          "The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the development, progression, and metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The TME comprises various cellular and acellular components, including immune cells, stromal cells, cytokines, extracellular matrix, and the oral microbiome, all of which dynamically interact with tumor cells to influence their behavior. Immunosuppression is a key feature of the OSCC TME, with regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contributing to an environment that allows tumor cells to evade immune surveillance and supports angiogenesis. The oral microbiome also plays a pivotal role in OSCC pathogenesis, as dysbiosis, or imbalances in the microbiota, can lead to chronic inflammation, which promotes carcinogenesis through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential for regulating bone homeostasis. Osteoclasts, multinucleated giant cells differentiated from macrophage lineage, are responsible for osteolytic bone conditions which are closely linked to ROS signaling pathways. In this study, an anti\u2010ROS enzyme, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) was found to be expressed both in bone marrow macrophages and osteoclasts. Recombinant Prdx1 protein was found to dose\u2010dependently inhibit ROS production and osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, Prdx1 protein also attenuated NFATc1 activation as well as the expression of C\u2010Fos, V\u2010ATPase\u2010d2, Cathepsin K, and Integrin \u03b1V.

          "Recent studies hint at mitochondrial genes influencing UC patient response to anti-TNF treatment. We evaluated this hypothesis by following a targeted strategy to identify gene expression that captures the relationship between mitochondrial dysregulation and response to treatment. Our objective was to initially examine this relationship in colon samples and subsequently assess whether the resulting signal persists in the bloodstream. We analyzed the transcriptome of colon samples from an anti-TNF-treated murine model characterized by impaired mitochondrial activity and treatment resistance. We then transferred the findings that linked mitochondrial dysfunction and compromised treatment response to an anti-TNF-treated UC human cohort. We next matched differential expression in the blood using monocytes from the peripheral blood of controls and IBD patients, and we evaluated a classification process at baseline with whole blood samples from UC patients. In human colon samples, the derived gene set from the murine model showed differential expression, primarily enriched metabolic pathways, and exhibited similar classification capacity as genes enriching inflammatory pathways. Moreover, the evaluation of the classification signal using blood samples from UC patients at baseline highlighted the involvement of mitochondrial homeostasis in treatment response. Our results highlight the involvement of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial homeostasis in determining treatment response and their ability to provide promising classification signals with detection levels in both the colon and the bloodstream."

          "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily for 3\u00a0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily and 500\u00a0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group). Patients were assessed via Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The serum concentrations of toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4), \u03b1-synuclein, brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) were measured before and after treatment.

          "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an efficient treatment for movement disorders, most commonly Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), dystonia and essential tremor. DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.",

From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In this paper, therefore, we summarize the evidence to date on these abnormalities with the intent to illustrate and clarify the main neuroanatomical differences between patients with tic disorders and healthy individuals.",
          "Cognitive impairment, a major determinant of poor functioning in schizophrenia, had limited responses to existing antipsychotic drugs. The limited efficacy could be due to regional differences in the dysregulation of the dopamine system. This study investigated striatal and peripheral dopaminergic makers in schizophrenia and their relationship with cognitive impairment. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated. We evaluated their cognitive performance, examined the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT, and measured plasma levels of dopaminergic precursors (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) that compete with precursors for brain uptake via ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Schizophrenia patients exhibited lower cognitive performance, decreased striatal DAT availability, and reduced levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA. Within the patient group, lower DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen was positively associated with attention deficits. Meanwhile, lower tyrosine levels and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA were positively related to executive dysfunction. Among all participants, DAT availability in the right CN or putamen was positively related to memory function, and plasma phenylalanine level was positively associated with executive function. This study supports the role of dopamine system abnormalities in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The distinct associations between different dopaminergic alterations and specific cognitive domain impairments suggest the potential need for multifaceted treatment approaches to target these impairments.",

Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (\u0394scales), OCT (\u0394retinal thickness), PERG (\u0394PERG values) and VEP (\u0394P100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral \u0394N95 latencies for PERG and \u0394P100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT.

Two resting-state functional MRIs were collected in two clinical trials of 48 patients with TRD (clinical trial 1; 32 receiving ketamine, 16 receiving a normal saline placebo) and 48 patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation (clinical trial 2; 24 receiving ketamine, 24 receiving midazolam), respectively. All participants underwent rs-fMRI before and 3 days after infusion. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) was analyzed in the left/right thalamus. FCs between the bilateral thalamus and right middle frontal cortex (BA46) and between the left thalamus and left anterior paracingulate gyrus (BA8) increased among patients in the ketamine group in clinical trials 1 and 2, respectively.

          "In severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), sedatives are often used to control intracranial pressure (ICP), to reduce brain metabolism, to allow for other treatments such as mechanical ventilation or targeted temperature management, or to control paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\u00a0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\u00a0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\u00a0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\u00a0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points.

In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world. While the key elements are agreed upon, more research and global collaboration are needed to create consistent guidelines and improve patient outcomes.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.5278230309486389, 'retrieval_method': 'initial_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC1748704577')",

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.\", metadata={'similarity_score': 0.4415596127510071, 'retrieval_method': 'initial_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC11650328')",

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM.

The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators.

These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS.

Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety.

Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation.

          "Document(page_content='Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.35597899556159973, 'retrieval_method': 'knowledge_base_expansion'}, id='PMC11649434')",

It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases.

This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.35549992322921753, 'retrieval_method': 'knowledge_base_expansion'}, id='PMC1748704493')",

This includes large, horizontal, and radial tears and even for meniscal cysts, especially in a stable knee. This technique can also be used in revision meniscal suture when failure is no longer an option. Fibrin clot is prepared from sterile peripheral venous blood from the patient.

        "answer": "Levodopa is a commonly used medication in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a decrease in dopamine levels in the brain. Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine, and when administered, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. This increase in dopamine levels helps alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.\n\nWhile levodopa provides symptomatic relief for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, it does not slow down the progression of the disease itself. Levodopa therapy is often combined with other medications, such as carbidopa, which helps prevent the breakdown of levodopa before it reaches the brain, increasing its effectiveness and reducing side effects.\n\nIt is important to note that levodopa therapy may be associated with side effects such as dyskinesias (abnormal involuntary movements) and motor fluctuations (fluctuations between periods of good symptom control and periods of poor symptom control). Additionally, long-term use of levodopa may lead to the development of motor complications known as levodopa-induced dyskinesias. \n\nIn summary, the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease involves replenishing dopamine levels in the brain, thereby improving motor symptoms. However, levodopa does not address the underlying cause of the disease and does not slow its progression.",

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \\n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.3747374415397644, 'retrieval_method': 'initial_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC1748704811')",

However, there is uncertainty regarding how demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed following this expansion of indications, as it has not been extensively studied.\n\nSGLT2 inhibitors are primarily used for the management of type 2 diabetes, with lifestyle changes, oral medications like metformin, and insulin therapy being common treatments for the condition. Metformin, a first-line medication for type 2 diabetes, helps lower glucose production in the liver and improves insulin sensitivity.\n\nIn addition to their role in diabetes management, SGLT2 inhibitors may also have cardiovascular benefits. They are known to improve myocardial microcirculation and reduce adverse events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), particularly in older patients for whom standard anticoagulants may not yield optimal outcomes. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors, such as bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, could be effective in enhancing cardiovascular health in certain patient populations.\n\nWhile the exact mechanisms of how SGLT2 inhibitors provide cardiovascular benefits are not explicitly outlined in the documents provided, their potential role in improving heart failure and chronic kidney disease outcomes suggests a positive impact on cardiovascular health.

This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts.

Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones that bind to glucocorticoid receptors in immune cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Upon binding to these receptors, glucocorticoids regulate the expression of genes involved in inflammation, leading to the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the promotion of anti-inflammatory mediators. This results in a dampening of the immune response and reduction of inflammation.\n\nSpecifically, glucocorticoids inhibit the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, such as those encoding cytokines like interleukins and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1). They also enhance the transcription of anti-inflammatory genes, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and lipocortin-1, which can inhibit phospholipase A2 and thereby reduce the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.\n\nIn addition to their direct effects on immune cells, glucocorticoids also influence other cell types involved in inflammation, such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts. They can reduce the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting the recruitment of immune cells to sites of inflammation. Glucocorticoids can also suppress the production of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins by fibroblasts, which can contribute to the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair.\n\nOverall, glucocorticoids play a crucial role in regulating the inflammatory response by modulating gene expression in immune and non-immune cells.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

        "answer": "The mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease involves its conversion into dopamine in the brain. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a decrease in dopamine levels. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine and can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the brain, where it is converted into dopamine by dopa decarboxylase. This helps to replenish the depleted dopamine levels in the brain, alleviating the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\n\nIt is important to note that levodopa does not slow down the progression of Parkinson's disease or prevent the loss of dopaminergic neurons. It primarily provides symptomatic relief by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. Other treatments, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), are used to manage the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders but do not address the underlying neurodegenerative process. \n\nIn conclusion, levodopa works by replenishing dopamine levels in the brain to alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, it does not slow down the progression of the disease itself.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development.

The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.4158058762550354, 'retrieval_method': 'knowledge_base_expansion'}, id='PMC1748704682')",

The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis.

        "answer": "Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones that have potent anti-inflammatory properties. They function by suppressing inflammation through multiple mechanisms. One of the main ways in which glucocorticoids suppress inflammation is by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Glucocorticoids can enter cells and bind to glucocorticoid receptors, which then translocate to the cell nucleus and bind to specific DNA sequences known as glucocorticoid response elements (GREs). This binding leads to the inhibition of pro-inflammatory gene transcription, such as genes encoding cytokines like interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).\n\nAdditionally, glucocorticoids also promote the expression of anti-inflammatory genes, such as genes encoding anti-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-10 (IL-10) and inhibitors of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. This shift in the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory gene expression helps to dampen the inflammatory response.\n\nFurthermore, glucocorticoids can also inhibit the activity of key transcription factors involved in inflammation, such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). These transcription factors are critical for the expression of many pro-inflammatory genes, and by inhibiting their activity, glucocorticoids can further suppress inflammation.\n\nIn conclusion, glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, promoting the expression of anti-inflammatory genes, and inhibiting the activity of key transcription factors involved in inflammation. It is important to note that while glucocorticoids are effective anti-inflammatory agents, their use can also be associated with side effects and risks, particularly when used long-term or at high doses. Additional research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of glucocorticoid action and potential strategies to optimize their therapeutic benefits while minimizing adverse effects.",

          "Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.42549756169319153, 'retrieval_method': 'knowledge_base_expansion'}, id='PMC1748704565')",

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a deficiency of dopamine in the brain. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine and can cross the blood-brain barrier, where it is converted into dopamine by the remaining dopaminergic neurons. This increase in dopamine levels helps to alleviate the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.\n\nWhile the provided documents do not specifically mention the mechanism of action of levodopa, it is a well-established fact in the field of neurology and pharmacology. Levodopa is often used in combination with other medications, such as carbidopa, to enhance its effectiveness and reduce side effects.

Specific modifications like N6\u2010methyladenine (m6A), N1\u2010methyladenine (m1A), 5\u2010methylcytosine (m5C), pseudouridine and adenosine\u2010to\u2010inosine (A\u2010to\u2010I) play key roles, with their regulators serving as crucial therapeutic targets. These epitranscriptomic changes intricately control gene expression, influencing cellular functions and contributing to disease pathology. Dysregulation of RNA metabolism, affecting mRNA processing and noncoding RNA biogenesis, is a central factor in these diseases. This review underscores the complex relationship between RNA modifications and neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing the influence of RNA modification and the epitranscriptome, exploring the function of RNA modification enzymes in neurodegenerative processes, investigating the functional consequences of RNA modifications within neurodegenerative pathways, and evaluating the potential therapeutic advancements derived from assessing the epitranscriptome.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.3291095793247223, 'retrieval_method': 'knowledge_base_expansion'}, id='PMC11649393')",

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination.

Each criterion was assigned a relative weight by 77 multidisciplinary experts. For each entity, 98 physicians from various specialties rated each criterion against the entity, using a four-class Likert-type scale; the ratings were converted into numeric values with a nonlinear scale and respectively weighted to calculate the entity score. Fifteen entities were ranked as high-priorities, including Disease\\u2009X and 14 known pathologies (e.g. haemorrhagic fevers, various respiratory viral infections, arboviral infections, multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, invasive meningococcal and pneumococcal diseases, prion diseases, rabies, and tuberculosis).

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination.

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination. Imaging should include standard radiographic series (anteroposterior, posteroanterior flexion, lateral, and sunrise views), long-leg mechanical axis views to assess coronal plane alignment and standing lateral ACL stress radiographs to assess sagittal alignment and objective instability.

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination.

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination. Imaging should include standard radiographic series (anteroposterior, posteroanterior flexion, lateral, and sunrise views), long-leg mechanical axis views to assess coronal plane alignment and standing lateral ACL stress radiographs to assess sagittal alignment and objective instability.

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination. Imaging should include standard radiographic series (anteroposterior, posteroanterior flexion, lateral, and sunrise views), long-leg mechanical axis views to assess coronal plane alignment and standing lateral ACL stress radiographs to assess sagittal alignment and objective instability.

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination. Imaging should include standard radiographic series (anteroposterior, posteroanterior flexion, lateral, and sunrise views), long-leg mechanical axis views to assess coronal plane alignment and standing lateral ACL stress radiographs to assess sagittal alignment and objective instability.

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination. Imaging should include standard radiographic series (anteroposterior, posteroanterior flexion, lateral, and sunrise views), long-leg mechanical axis views to assess coronal plane alignment and standing lateral ACL stress radiographs to assess sagittal alignment and objective instability.

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination. Imaging should include standard radiographic series (anteroposterior, posteroanterior flexion, lateral, and sunrise views), long-leg mechanical axis views to assess coronal plane alignment and standing lateral ACL stress radiographs to assess sagittal alignment and objective instability. The iliotibial band ALLR graft is harvested first. An 8-cm long by 1-cm wide strip of the inferior iliotibial band is harvested in a standard fashion, leaving the distal aspect attached to Gerdy\u2019s tubercle. An anchor is placed centered upon the native ALL distal tibial insertion. The native ALL femoral origin is identified at 4.7 mm posterior and proximal to the fibular collateral ligament, and a second suture anchor is placed at this point. Final fixation is performed after the final fixation of the ACLR graft. A study by Pioger et al reported that patients with ACLR and ALLR had significantly less reoperation rate than patients with isolated ACLR, 8.9% versus 20.5% respectively. Lee et al found that a revision ACLR in combination with an ALLR was effective in reducing rotational laxity, which was assessed by the pivot-shift test.

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination. Imaging should include standard radiographic series (anteroposterior, posteroanterior flexion, lateral, and sunrise views), long-leg mechanical axis views to assess coronal plane alignment and standing lateral ACL stress radiographs to assess sagittal alignment and objective instability. The iliotibial band ALLR graft is harvested first. An 8-cm long by 1-cm wide strip of the inferior iliotibial band is harvested in a standard fashion, leaving the distal aspect attached to Gerdy\u2019s tubercle. An anchor is placed centered upon the native ALL distal tibial insertion. The native ALL femoral origin is identified at 4.7 mm posterior and proximal to the fibular collateral ligament, and a second suture anchor is placed at this point. Final fixation is performed after the final fixation of the ACLR graft. A study by Pioger et al reported that patients with ACLR and ALLR had significantly less reoperation rate than patients with isolated ACLR, 8.9% versus 20.5% respectively. Lee et al found that a revision ACLR in combination with an ALLR was effective in reducing rotational laxity, which was assessed by the pivot-shift test. We describe a technique for a new anatomic ALLR using the iliotibial band that attempts to restore the native ALL anatomy.

Altered activity in regions implicated in AUDs, like the basolateral amygdala (BLA), has been suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of AUDs, but how these networks contribute to alcohol misuse remains unclear. Here we investigated how the impact of alcohol on the BLA network relates to alcohol exposure. We first examined the effect of acute ethanol administration on the BLA and frontal cortical networks and the relationship with subsequent voluntary ethanol consumption using the Intermittent Access paradigm. In addition, we recorded network activity from the BLA and frontal cortex throughout the Drinking-in-the-Dark-Multiple Scheduled Access paradigm to assess the impact of voluntary alcohol consumption on network states during binge and abstinence periods. Finally, we investigated the impact of acute withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure on BLA and frontal cortex network states using the Chronic Intermittent Ethanol (vapor) paradigm.

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination. Imaging should include standard radiographic series (anteroposterior, posteroanterior flexion, lateral, and sunrise views), long-leg mechanical axis views to assess coronal plane alignment and standing lateral ACL stress radiographs to assess sagittal alignment and objective instability. The iliotibial band ALLR graft is harvested first. An 8-cm long by 1-cm wide strip of the inferior iliotibial band is harvested in a standard fashion, leaving the distal aspect attached to Gerdy\u2019s tubercle. An anchor is placed centered upon the native ALL distal tibial insertion. The native ALL femoral origin is identified at 4.7 mm posterior and proximal to the fibular collateral ligament, and a second suture anchor is placed at this point. Final fixation is performed after the final fixation of the ACLR graft. A study by Pioger et al reported that patients with ACLR and ALLR had significantly less reoperation rate than patients with isolated ACLR, 8.9% versus 20.5% respectively. Lee et al found that a revision ACLR in combination with an ALLR was effective in reducing rotational laxity, which was assessed by the pivot-shift test.

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination. Imaging should include standard radiographic series (anteroposterior, posteroanterior flexion, lateral, and sunrise views), long-leg mechanical axis views to assess coronal plane alignment and standing lateral ACL stress radiographs to assess sagittal alignment and objective instability. The iliotibial band ALLR graft is harvested first. An 8-cm long by 1-cm wide strip of the inferior iliotibial band is harvested in a standard fashion, leaving the distal aspect attached to Gerdy\u2019s tubercle. An anchor is placed centered upon the native ALL distal tibial insertion. The native ALL femoral origin is identified at 4.7 mm posterior and proximal to the fibular collateral ligament, and a second suture anchor is placed at this point. Final fixation is performed after the final fixation of the ACLR graft. A study by Pioger et al reported that patients with ACLR and ALLR had significantly less reoperation rate than patients with isolated ACLR, 8.9% versus 20.5% respectively. Lee et al found that a revision ACLR in combination with an ALLR was effective in reducing rotational laxity, which was assessed by the pivot-shift test.

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination. Imaging should include standard radiographic series (anteroposterior, posteroanterior flexion, lateral, and sunrise views), long-leg mechanical axis views to assess coronal plane alignment and standing lateral ACL stress radiographs to assess sagittal alignment and objective instability. The iliotibial band ALLR graft is harvested first. An 8-cm long by 1-cm wide strip of the inferior iliotibial band is harvested in a standard fashion, leaving the distal aspect attached to Gerdy\u2019s tubercle. An anchor is placed centered upon the native ALL distal tibial insertion. The native ALL femoral origin is identified at 4.7 mm posterior and proximal to the fibular collateral ligament, and a second suture anchor is placed at this point. Final fixation is performed after the final fixation of the ACLR graft. A study by Pioger et al reported that patients with ACLR and ALLR had significantly less reoperation rate than patients with isolated ACLR, 8.9% versus 20.5% respectively. Lee et al found that a revision ACLR in combination with an ALLR was effective in reducing rotational laxity, which was assessed by the pivot-shift test.

While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination. Imaging should include standard radiographic series (anteroposterior, posteroanterior flexion, lateral, and sunrise views), long-leg mechanical axis views to assess coronal plane alignment and standing lateral ACL stress radiographs to assess sagittal alignment and objective instability. The iliotibial band ALLR graft is harvested first. An 8-cm long by 1-cm wide strip of the inferior iliotibial band is harvested in a standard fashion, leaving the distal aspect attached to Gerdy\u2019s tubercle. An anchor is placed centered upon the native ALL distal tibial insertion. The native ALL femoral origin is identified at 4.7 mm posterior and proximal to the fibular collateral ligament, and a second suture anchor is placed at this point. Final fixation is performed after the final fixation of the ACLR graft. A study by Pioger et al reported that patients with ACLR and ALLR had significantly less reoperation rate than patients with isolated ACLR, 8.9% versus 20.5% respectively. Lee et al found that a revision ACLR in combination with an ALLR was effective in reducing rotational laxity, which was assessed by the pivot-shift test. We describe a technique for a new anatomic ALLR using the iliotibial band that attempts to restore the native ALL anatomy. This surgical technique effectively restores rotational laxity and improves knee stability. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

After ACLRs, many patients still have residual anterolateral instability which is a risk factor for ACL graft failure. An anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) attempts to restore the native function of the anterolateral complex to augment the ACL. Performing an ALLR with an ACLR has been reported to reduce symptoms of instability and improve clinical outcomes. While no definitive indication for an ALLR has been set, current considerations include high posterior tibial slope >12\u00b0, revision ACLR, high-grade pivot shift, skeletally immature patients, hyperlaxity, and patients in high-level sports. The preoperative assessment includes a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to rotational laxity assessed via the pivot-shift examination. Imaging should include standard radiographic series (anteroposterior, posteroanterior flexion, lateral, and sunrise views), long-leg mechanical axis views to assess coronal plane alignment and standing lateral ACL stress radiographs to assess sagittal alignment and objective instability. The iliotibial band ALLR graft is harvested first. An 8-cm long by 1-cm wide strip of the inferior iliotibial band is harvested in a standard fashion, leaving the distal aspect attached to Gerdy\u2019s tubercle. An anchor is placed centered upon the native ALL distal tibial insertion. The native ALL femoral origin is identified at 4.7 mm posterior and proximal to the fibular collateral ligament, and a second suture anchor is placed at this point.

The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects.

Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation.

Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.\", metadata={'title': 'Lipodystrophy With an Uncommon Clinical Presentation in a Patient With Insulin-Requiring Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus', 'similarity_score': 0.4415598213672638, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC11650328')",

This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571).

Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM.

Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use.

The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation.

HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia.

The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis.

          "Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use.

The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation.

Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF.

The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis.

          "Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.', metadata={'title': 'Enhancing Home Blood Pressure Management: Implementation of the Sacubitril/Valsartan Treatment in Practical Clinical Settings', 'similarity_score': 0.3726801872253418, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC1748704693')",

Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes.

We used generalized estimating equation models to identify baseline lipid species associated with change in ABI and the Cox frailty regression to examine whether lipids associated with change in ABI were also associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD). We also examined the longitudinal association between change in lipid species and change in ABI and the cross-sectional association of individual lipids with ABI.

Baseline levels of 120 lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, fatty acids, and sphingomyelins, were associated with change in ABI. Among these, higher baseline levels of 3 known lipids (phosphatidylinositol[16:0/20:4], triacylglycerol[48:2], triacylglycerol[55:1]) were associated with a lower risk of CHD (hazard ratios [95% CIs] ranged from 0.67 [0.46\u20130.99] to 0.76 [0.58\u20130.99]), while cholesterol was associated with a higher risk of CHD (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.37 [1.00\u20131.87]).

This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development.

The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts.

          "Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells.

In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions.

          "Document(page_content='Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases.

          "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world. While the key elements are agreed upon, more research and global collaboration are needed to create consistent guidelines and improve patient outcomes.",
          "We report the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy with a history of recurrent and severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy with an uncommon clinical presentation. This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

          "Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan.

          "This study analyzes data from the 2009\u20132018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to explore the relationship between the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI), also referred to as the pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) among adults in the United States. Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.",
          "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily for 3\u00a0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily and 500\u00a0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group).

          "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",

The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS.

          "NLRP3 is an intracellular sensor molecule that affects neutrophil functionality and infiltration in brain disorders such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the role of NLRP3 in these processes remain unknown. We found that NLRP3 is crucial for neutrophil infiltration, whereas dispensable for neutrophil priming. Notably, NLRP3 activation in neutrophils induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and neutrophil infiltration into the brain via CXCL1/2 secretion and subsequent activation of the CXCL1/2-CXCR2 signaling axis. Moreover, CXCL1 and CXCL2 in the inflamed brain directly reduced Claudin-5 expression, which regulates BBB permeability in brain endothelial cells. Furthermore, neutrophil-specific NLRP3 activation aggravated EAE pathogenesis by promoting CXCR2-mediated infiltration of both neutrophils and CD4 The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12974-025-03468-6.",
          "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world. While the key elements are agreed upon, more research and global collaboration are needed to create consistent guidelines and improve patient outcomes.",

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan.

          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety.

Studies reveal that COVID\u201019 patients often suffer from certain vascular diseases, partly attributed to increased proliferation or altered phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Although the association between COVID\u201019 and VSMCs is recognized, the precise mechanism underlying SARS\u2010CoV\u20102's influence on VSMC phenotype remains largely under\u2010reviewed. In this context, while there is a consistent body of literature dissecting the effect of COVID\u201019 on the cardiovascular system, few reports delve into the potential role of VSMC switching in the pathophysiology associated with COVID\u201019 and the molecular mechanisms involved therein. This review dissects and critiques the link between COVID\u201019 and VSMCs, with particular attention to pathways involving cholesterol, calcium, and phosphate. These pathways underpin the interaction between the virus and VSMCs. Such interaction promotes VSMC proliferation, and eventually potentiates vascular calcification as well as worsens prognosis in patients with COVID\u201019.",
          "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.",

          "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and dyslipidemia are both independent predictors of cardiovascular disease, but the association between individual lipid species and subclinical PAD, assessed by ankle-brachial index (ABI), is lacking in large-scale longitudinal studies. We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to repeatedly measure 1,542 lipid species from 1,886 American Indian adults attending 2 clinical examinations (mean ~5 years apart) in the Strong Heart Family Study. We used generalized estimating equation models to identify baseline lipid species associated with change in ABI and the Cox frailty regression to examine whether lipids associated with change in ABI were also associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD). We also examined the longitudinal association between change in lipid species and change in ABI and the cross-sectional association of individual lipids with ABI. All models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, and lipid-lowering medication. Baseline levels of 120 lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, fatty acids, and sphingomyelins, were associated with change in ABI. Among these, higher baseline levels of 3 known lipids (phosphatidylinositol[16:0/20:4], triacylglycerol[48:2], triacylglycerol[55:1]) were associated with a lower risk of CHD (hazard ratios [95% CIs] ranged from 0.67 [0.46\u20130.99] to 0.76 [0.58\u20130.99]), while cholesterol was associated with a higher risk of CHD (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.37 [1.00\u20131.87]). Longitudinal changes in 32 lipids were significantly associated with change in ABI during 5-year follow-up. Plasma levels of glycerophospholipids, triacylglycerols, and glycosylceramides were significantly associated with ABI in the cross-sectional analysis.

Despite treatment advancements, patients will still face vascular complications, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Human proteins play crucial roles in biology and drug research. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

          "Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) remains a rare congenital disorder with a wide range of manifestations. The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included \u201cheart failure\u201d, \u201cccTGA\u201d, \u201cVAD\u201d, \u201cheart transplantation\u201d, and \u201csystemic RV failure\u201d. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.",
          "Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.",
          "Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.",

          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",
          "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.",

          "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",
          "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases.

          "Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.",

Human gingival fibroblast responses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3 expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same individual.

Among 2321 patients who started b/tsDMARDs between 2010 and 2023, we focused on 295 patients who had knee swelling or tenderness at the initiation of b/tsDMARDs and continued b/tsDMARDs at least 3 months, with recorded knee symptoms 6 months later. Symptom relief after 6 months was 78.2% for interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitors, 68.6% for Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, 65.8% for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and 57.6% for cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-Ig (CTLA4-Ig). The initial use of b/tsDMARDs and the use of IL-6 inhibitors in comparison to CTLA4-Ig emerged as a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms. Among 141 patients who underwent knee radiography at baseline and two years later, the deterioration in knee joint radiographs was 7.7% for IL-6 inhibitors, 6.3% for JAK inhibitors, 21.9% for TNF inhibitors, and 25.9% for CTLA4-Ig. The use of IL-6 inhibitors was a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms and the inhibition of joint destruction compared to CTLA4-Ig.",
          "Usenamine A (UA) is a natural compound isolated from the lichen  Usnea diffracta Molecular docking was performed between the 3D structure of UA and the TNF-TNFR2 complex. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA and AS patients were treated with UA, and cell viability was measured using the MTS assay and flow cytometry. The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of \u22125.251 kcal/mol and \u22126.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients. In the arthritis mouse model, significantly reduced clinical and histological scores were observed in the UA treatment group. Our findings suggest that UA has potential as a binding target for TNF, suppresses inflammatory cytokines in PBMCs, and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on arthritis in a mouse model.",
          "Preoperative levels of certain inflammatory markers in the blood can predict acute infection after primary total joint arthroplasty in patients without inflammatory disease, but whether they can do so in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut\u2010off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio, C\u2010reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020. We compared preoperative levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) between patients who suffered acute infection or not within 90\u2009days after surgery. The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut\u2010off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut\u2010off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut\u2010off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L). The neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte\u2010lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%. The preoperative NLR shows some ability to predict acute infection after total joint arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Monitoring this ratio, perhaps in conjunction with other markers not analyzed here, may be useful for optimizing the timing of surgery in order to minimize risk of postoperative infection.",
          "Patients infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) often present with rheumatic symptoms, but its link to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unclear. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate whether HCV infection is related to the risk for RA in adults. We analyzed data from the 2017\u20132020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). HCV infection and RA status were determined through questionnaires. Covariates included gender, age, race, marital status, body mass index (BMI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and diabetes status. Multivariate logistic regression and subgroup analyses were used to assess the relationship between HCV infection and RA risk. In this population-based study involving 5,825 participants aged 18\u201380 years (including 485 RA patients), we observed a significantly higher prevalence of HCV infection in the RA group compared with non-RA controls. After adjusting for covariates, multivariate logistic regression showed that HCV infection was associated with an increased risk of RA (OR\u2009=\u20091.93; 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.07\u20133.50,  p This study demonstrates that HCV infection is associated with the risk of RA in adults, underscoring the potential value of HCV screening in RA patients for improved disease management.

          "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.",
          "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging.

          "Failure rate of meniscal repair can reach 25%. Multiple techniques have been used to increase meniscal healing, notably biological augmentation techniques. One of them is fibrin clot\u2013augmented meniscal repair, which will be described in this video. This technique is indicated mainly for the lesions with a high failure rate. This includes large, horizontal, and radial tears and even for meniscal cysts, especially in a stable knee. This technique can also be used in revision meniscal suture when failure is no longer an option. Fibrin clot is prepared from sterile peripheral venous blood from the patient. A plastic syringe is used to stir the blood in a sterile glass container. The fibrin clot is then formed and washed rigorously with saline solution. Rolling the fibrin clot which is fixed to the syringe allows to give the fibrillar aspect of the clot. The formed fibrin clot is now solid enough to be manipulated and can be fixed to a vicryl suture thread allowing it to enter the knee and be fixed inside the meniscal lesion. The clot is wrapped inside the meniscal lesion with inside-out or outside-in suture technique. We used this technique for multiple types of lesions, like bucket handle meniscal tear, horizontal meniscal cleavage, parrot beak tear, and even in lesions within white-white zone. The postoperative protocol is the same as standard inside-out meniscal repair. This technique has been used in the literature with promising results.

Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily for 3\u00a0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\u00a0mg) three times daily and 500\u00a0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group).

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.",

The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (\u0394scales), OCT (\u0394retinal thickness), PERG (\u0394PERG values) and VEP (\u0394P100 latencies).

Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement.

          "This study analyzes data from the 2009\u20132018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to explore the relationship between the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI), also referred to as the pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) among adults in the United States. Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.",

Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30).

          "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",

The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.",
          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.",

          "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome.

They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease.

Studies reveal that COVID\u201019 patients often suffer from certain vascular diseases, partly attributed to increased proliferation or altered phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Although the association between COVID\u201019 and VSMCs is recognized, the precise mechanism underlying SARS\u2010CoV\u20102's influence on VSMC phenotype remains largely under\u2010reviewed. In this context, while there is a consistent body of literature dissecting the effect of COVID\u201019 on the cardiovascular system, few reports delve into the potential role of VSMC switching in the pathophysiology associated with COVID\u201019 and the molecular mechanisms involved therein. This review dissects and critiques the link between COVID\u201019 and VSMCs, with particular attention to pathways involving cholesterol, calcium, and phosphate. These pathways underpin the interaction between the virus and VSMCs. Such interaction promotes VSMC proliferation, and eventually potentiates vascular calcification as well as worsens prognosis in patients with COVID\u201019.",
          "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.",

          "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and dyslipidemia are both independent predictors of cardiovascular disease, but the association between individual lipid species and subclinical PAD, assessed by ankle-brachial index (ABI), is lacking in large-scale longitudinal studies. We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to repeatedly measure 1,542 lipid species from 1,886 American Indian adults attending 2 clinical examinations (mean ~5 years apart) in the Strong Heart Family Study. We used generalized estimating equation models to identify baseline lipid species associated with change in ABI and the Cox frailty regression to examine whether lipids associated with change in ABI were also associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD). We also examined the longitudinal association between change in lipid species and change in ABI and the cross-sectional association of individual lipids with ABI. All models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, and lipid-lowering medication. Baseline levels of 120 lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, fatty acids, and sphingomyelins, were associated with change in ABI. Among these, higher baseline levels of 3 known lipids (phosphatidylinositol[16:0/20:4], triacylglycerol[48:2], triacylglycerol[55:1]) were associated with a lower risk of CHD (hazard ratios [95% CIs] ranged from 0.67 [0.46\u20130.99] to 0.76 [0.58\u20130.99]), while cholesterol was associated with a higher risk of CHD (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.37 [1.00\u20131.87]). Longitudinal changes in 32 lipids were significantly associated with change in ABI during 5-year follow-up. Plasma levels of glycerophospholipids, triacylglycerols, and glycosylceramides were significantly associated with ABI in the cross-sectional analysis. Altered plasma lipidome is significantly associated with subclinical PAD in American Indians beyond traditional risk factors. If validated, the identified lipid species may serve as novel biomarkers for PAD in this high-risk but understudied population.",

          "Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a common cardiovascular condition marked by peripheral artery stenosis or occlusion. Despite treatment advancements, patients will still face vascular complications, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Human proteins play crucial roles in biology and drug research. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included \u201cheart failure\u201d, \u201cccTGA\u201d, \u201cVAD\u201d, \u201cheart transplantation\u201d, and \u201csystemic RV failure\u201d. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.",

This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022.

          "Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases.

          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",
          "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.",

          "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",
          "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases.

One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging.

          "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity.

          "Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.",

Cytokine levels in PICF or GCF of the same individual were compared using the paired t-test, and those from titanium or gold-casting (UCLA) abutment were compared using the independent t-test. Human gingival fibroblast responses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3 expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same individual. However, IL-1\u03b2 (p = 0.032) and IL-1\u03b1 (p = 0.030) was statistically significantly higher in PICF than in GCF.

A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR.

This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.",
          "Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.",

          "Failure rate of meniscal repair can reach 25%. Multiple techniques have been used to increase meniscal healing, notably biological augmentation techniques. One of them is fibrin clot\u2013augmented meniscal repair, which will be described in this video. This technique is indicated mainly for the lesions with a high failure rate. This includes large, horizontal, and radial tears and even for meniscal cysts, especially in a stable knee. This technique can also be used in revision meniscal suture when failure is no longer an option. Fibrin clot is prepared from sterile peripheral venous blood from the patient. A plastic syringe is used to stir the blood in a sterile glass container. The fibrin clot is then formed and washed rigorously with saline solution. Rolling the fibrin clot which is fixed to the syringe allows to give the fibrillar aspect of the clot. The formed fibrin clot is now solid enough to be manipulated and can be fixed to a vicryl suture thread allowing it to enter the knee and be fixed inside the meniscal lesion. The clot is wrapped inside the meniscal lesion with inside-out or outside-in suture technique. We used this technique for multiple types of lesions, like bucket handle meniscal tear, horizontal meniscal cleavage, parrot beak tear, and even in lesions within white-white zone. The postoperative protocol is the same as standard inside-out meniscal repair. This technique has been used in the literature with promising results. The fibrin clot\u2013augmented meniscal repair is a demanding but promising technique. We need further follow-up to confirm its effectiveness.

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.",

The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (\u0394scales), OCT (\u0394retinal thickness), PERG (\u0394PERG values) and VEP (\u0394P100 latencies).

          "Neurodegenerative disorders encompass a group of age\u2010related conditions characterized by the gradual decline in both the structure and functionality of the central nervous system (CNS). RNA modifications, arising from the epitranscriptome or RNA\u2010modifying protein mutations, have recently been observed to contribute significantly to neurodegenerative disorders. Specific modifications like N6\u2010methyladenine (m6A), N1\u2010methyladenine (m1A), 5\u2010methylcytosine (m5C), pseudouridine and adenosine\u2010to\u2010inosine (A\u2010to\u2010I) play key roles, with their regulators serving as crucial therapeutic targets. These epitranscriptomic changes intricately control gene expression, influencing cellular functions and contributing to disease pathology. Dysregulation of RNA metabolism, affecting mRNA processing and noncoding RNA biogenesis, is a central factor in these diseases. This review underscores the complex relationship between RNA modifications and neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing the influence of RNA modification and the epitranscriptome, exploring the function of RNA modification enzymes in neurodegenerative processes, investigating the functional consequences of RNA modifications within neurodegenerative pathways, and evaluating the potential therapeutic advancements derived from assessing the epitranscriptome.",

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education.",

This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022.

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378\u20132.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators\u2014LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI \u2014 partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.",

          "In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways\u2019 interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD\u2019s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade \u201curemic inflammation\u201d in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.",

          "Primary glomerular disease (PGD) is an idiopathic cause of renal glomerular lesions that is characterized by proteinuria or hematuria and is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

However, the disease often relapses, which can impact allograft survival. We conducted a prospective multicenter study in France involving 72 patients with membranous nephropathy who were awaiting and then underwent kidney transplantation. In addition, we established a retrospective validation cohort of 65 patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic significance of pretransplant anti phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) antibodies on the recurrence of membranous nephropathy. The study also assessed the incidence rate, time to onset, and risk factors for recurrence, as well as allograft outcome. The prospective cohort showed a 26% cumulative incidence of membranous nephropathy recurrence after a median follow-up of 23.5 months. This was confirmed by a 28% cumulative incidence after a median follow-up of 67 months in the retrospective cohort.

The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety.

          "Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 \u00b1 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 \u00b1 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 \u00b1 11.0 bpm to 72.1 \u00b1 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01).

The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging.

          "The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.",

We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to repeatedly measure 1,542 lipid species from 1,886 American Indian adults attending 2 clinical examinations (mean ~5 years apart) in the Strong Heart Family Study. We used generalized estimating equation models to identify baseline lipid species associated with change in ABI and the Cox frailty regression to examine whether lipids associated with change in ABI were also associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD). We also examined the longitudinal association between change in lipid species and change in ABI and the cross-sectional association of individual lipids with ABI. All models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, and lipid-lowering medication. Baseline levels of 120 lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, fatty acids, and sphingomyelins, were associated with change in ABI. Among these, higher baseline levels of 3 known lipids (phosphatidylinositol[16:0/20:4], triacylglycerol[48:2], triacylglycerol[55:1]) were associated with a lower risk of CHD (hazard ratios [95% CIs] ranged from 0.67 [0.46\u20130.99] to 0.76 [0.58\u20130.99]), while cholesterol was associated with a higher risk of CHD (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.37 [1.00\u20131.87]).

Despite treatment advancements, patients will still face vascular complications, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Human proteins play crucial roles in biology and drug research. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included \u201cheart failure\u201d, \u201cccTGA\u201d, \u201cVAD\u201d, \u201cheart transplantation\u201d, and \u201csystemic RV failure\u201d. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.",

This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases.

          "Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGF\u03b2/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases.

          "Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin\u2019s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.",
          "The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions.

          "Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.",

          "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions. In this review, we highlight current findings on the role of ILCs and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma development and pathogenesis. We also examine the underlying mechanisms regulating their function and their interplay with other immune cells. Finally, we explore current therapies targeting these cells and their effector cytokines for asthma management.",
          "Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.",

Cytokine levels in PICF or GCF of the same individual were compared using the paired t-test, and those from titanium or gold-casting (UCLA) abutment were compared using the independent t-test. Human gingival fibroblast responses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3 expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same individual. However, IL-1\u03b2 (p = 0.032) and IL-1\u03b1 (p = 0.030) was statistically significantly higher in PICF than in GCF. IL-8 level was statistically significantly higher with gold-casting than with titanium abutments (p = 0.003). PICF statistically significantly stimulated higher expression of RANKL, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF), while focal adhesion kinase (FAK) suppressed mRNA. The inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, are higher in healthy peri-implant tissues. Abutment materials may also influence the level of inflammatory cytokines in PICF.

In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR.

To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.",
          "Tic disorders represent a developmental neuropsychiatric condition whose causes can be attributed to a variety of environmental, neurobiological, and genetic factors. From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In this paper, therefore, we summarize the evidence to date on these abnormalities with the intent to illustrate and clarify the main neuroanatomical differences between patients with tic disorders and healthy individuals.",

          "Bright light therapy (BLT) has been proved to have beneficial effects on Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), the mechanisms remained unclear. Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (\u0394scales), OCT (\u0394retinal thickness), PERG (\u0394PERG values) and VEP (\u0394P100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral \u0394N95 latencies for PERG and \u0394P100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT. BLT is a valuable and safe non-pharmacological intervention for improving visual function in PD patients. These findings extend neural mechanisms of BLT to visual pathways improvements.

          "An increasing body of evidence indicates altered DNA methylation in Parkinson's disease, yet the reproducibility and utility of such methylation changes are largely unexplored. We aimed to further elucidate the role of dysregulated DNA methylation in Parkinson's disease and to evaluate the biomarker potential of methylation\u2010based profiling. We conducted an epigenome\u2010wide association study (EWAS) in whole blood, including 280 Parkinson's disease and 279 control participants from Oslo, Norway. Next, we took advantage of data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and a previously published EWAS to conduct a whole blood EWAS meta\u2010analysis in Parkinson's disease, incorporating results from a total of 3068 participants. Finally, we generated multiple methylation\u2010based scores for each Oslo and PPMI participant and tested their association with disease status, individually and in a joint multiscore model. In EWAS meta\u2010analysis, we confirm  SLC7A11 LPIN1 Our results highlight the power of DNA methylation profiling to capture multiple aspects of disease risk, indicating a biomarker potential for precision medicine in neurodegenerative disorders. The reproducibility of specific differentially methylated CpGs across data sets was limited but may improve if future studies are designed to account for disease stage and incorporate environmental exposure data.",
          "Neurodegenerative disorders encompass a group of age\u2010related conditions characterized by the gradual decline in both the structure and functionality of the central nervous system (CNS). RNA modifications, arising from the epitranscriptome or RNA\u2010modifying protein mutations, have recently been observed to contribute significantly to neurodegenerative disorders. Specific modifications like N6\u2010methyladenine (m6A), N1\u2010methyladenine (m1A), 5\u2010methylcytosine (m5C), pseudouridine and adenosine\u2010to\u2010inosine (A\u2010to\u2010I) play key roles, with their regulators serving as crucial therapeutic targets. These epitranscriptomic changes intricately control gene expression, influencing cellular functions and contributing to disease pathology. Dysregulation of RNA metabolism, affecting mRNA processing and noncoding RNA biogenesis, is a central factor in these diseases. This review underscores the complex relationship between RNA modifications and neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing the influence of RNA modification and the epitranscriptome, exploring the function of RNA modification enzymes in neurodegenerative processes, investigating the functional consequences of RNA modifications within neurodegenerative pathways, and evaluating the potential therapeutic advancements derived from assessing the epitranscriptome.",
