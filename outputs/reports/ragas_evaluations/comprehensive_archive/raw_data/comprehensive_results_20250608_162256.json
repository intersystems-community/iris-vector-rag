          "To identify the occurrence of the amniotic deformity adhesions, mutilation (ADAM) complex and imperative role of fetal autopsy in diagnosing this condition. A retrospective descriptive study spanning nine years, from January 2014 to January 2022, was conducted at the Department of Pathology within a tertiary care hospital in South India. The study focused on analyzing the clinical presentation, prenatal ultrasonogram, and morphological features of fetuses with the ADAM complex, limb body wall complex, or amniotic bands. Among the 438 fetuses assessed during the study period, five fetuses showed features of the ADAM complex (0.01%). The most frequent gestational age observed was 12\u201318 weeks and most fetuses were female. The common anomaly encountered was limb defects, followed by abdominal and cranial anomalies. The diagnosis of the ADAM complex relies primarily on fetal autopsy to differentiate it from similar conditions like anencephaly or body-stalk anomalies. The pathologist plays a crucial role in understanding the complexities of the ADAM complex. Advanced antenatal imaging and therapies offer potential for prevention through improved counseling.",
          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication. If the individual may be identifiable, the author(s) has included a statement of release or other written form of approval from the patient(s) with this submission for publication.",
          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes. In our technique, use of adjustable cortical button minimizes bone loss on femoral wall while providing adequate fixation.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today. When precise surgical steps are followed, complication rates are low and patient outcomes are favorable."

        "answer": "Based on the provided documents, there is no direct information regarding how statins prevent cardiovascular disease. However, based on broader search results and general knowledge, statins are a class of medications commonly prescribed to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. By reducing cholesterol levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, statins help to prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This process can help to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular events.\n\nStatins work by inhibiting an enzyme in the liver that is involved in the production of cholesterol. By lowering cholesterol levels, statins can help to improve the overall health of the cardiovascular system and reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, which is the hardening and narrowing of the arteries due to plaque buildup.\n\nIn conclusion, statins prevent cardiovascular disease by lowering cholesterol levels in the blood, which in turn helps to reduce the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries and decrease the likelihood of cardiovascular events.",

Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair.

This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls.

Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction.

        "answer": "Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins and tumor necrosis factor. They also decrease the migration of immune cells to the site of inflammation and reduce the activity of immune cells involved in the inflammatory response. In addition, glucocorticoids can inhibit the expression of enzymes involved in the synthesis of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Overall, glucocorticoids have anti-inflammatory effects by targeting multiple pathways involved in the inflammatory response.\n\nUnfortunately, the provided documents do not contain specific information on how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation.

We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls.

The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is deficient in individuals with Parkinson's disease. By providing levodopa as a medication, it can cross the blood-brain barrier and be converted into dopamine in the brain, where it helps to alleviate some of the motor symptoms associated with the disease. Levodopa is often combined with carbidopa, which helps prevent the breakdown of levodopa before it reaches the brain, allowing for more effective conversion into dopamine.\n\nUnfortunately, the provided documents do not contain information directly related to Parkinson's disease or the mechanism of action of levodopa.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur.

ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Document(page_content='Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes.

          "Document(page_content='Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

          "Document(page_content='The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Document(page_content='Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes.

          "Document(page_content='Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

          "Document(page_content='The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today.

As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution.

The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain. The presented technique allows for appropriate management of these rare injuries. The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results. The inversion labral repair technique reliably restores the suction seal and prevents eversion of the labrum to preserve normal function.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle. The docking technique, as described in this video demonstration, is the most common MUCL reconstruction technique used today.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.

          "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been divided into repair versus reconstructive approaches. We present an ACL repair using FiberTape sutures as an internal brace and an adjustable cortical button fixation on the femur. ACL rupture is a condition in which restoration is essential to regaining adequate knee function. ACL repair may be indicated in patients with an acute tear (<4 weeks), Sherman classification type I or II tear, 35 years old or older, and with a mild-to-moderate activity level. ACL tightrope repair initially requires identification of the ACL tear. Following, there is femoral wall preparation and the creation of a drill tunnel in the femoral and tibial walls. FiberRing sutures are passed through the intact portion of the ACL as many times as desired. An ACL Tightrope is then fed through the FiberRing sutures. The ACL Tightrope and cortical button are passed through the femoral tunnel. FiberTape sutures are passed through a tibial tunnel to act as an internal brace. Range of motion and tension is assessed and adjusted as needed. Patients meeting indications for ACL repair and undergoing repair via Tightrope implants may have outcomes comparable to counterparts undergoing ACL reconstruction. Patient-completed functional knee scores, such as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Lysholm, are similar between the 2 restoration techniques. However, younger patients undergoing an ACL repair appear to have a higher failure rate compared with reconstruction. ACL repair can be an adjuvant treatment option with acute femoral sided tears. Caution should be exercised when performing this procedure on younger, higher level athletes.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, it is effectively treated with surgical intervention to restore normal fibular anatomy, and prevent recurrent instability and persistent pain.

          "Snapping biceps femoris syndrome (SFS) represents a rare clinical entity in which the biceps femoris subluxates over the fibular head in deep flexion. Two primary pathophysiologies have been described including a prominent or abnormal fibular head morphology. Others have implicated an anomalous biceps femoris insertion. The diagnosis is made clinically, with operative and nonoperative intervention strategies available for treatment. SFS often results in audible snapping and associated pain at the lateral fibular head. When recalcitrant to nonoperative management, surgical intervention can lead to resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a college-aged male who has bilateral symptoms, worse on the right, which have resulted in significant activity modification and daily discomfort recalcitrant to anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The patient was placed supine on the operating room table with an ipsilateral bump under the hip to assist in exposure of the lateral aspect of the knee. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) confirmed the snapping biceps femoris. A lateral approach to the knee and a common peroneal neurolysis was performed. The biceps femoris insertional anatomy was examined for anomalous tendon insertion or insertional tearing. The prominent fibular head was exposed and resected, with careful attention not to disrupt the lateral collateral ligament or popliteofibular ligament insertion sites. The biceps femoris was then repaired to the prepared bony bed of the fibula with one double-loaded suture anchor. Repeat EUA confirmed complete resolution of snapping even with maximal internal rotation of the tibia; this was carefully examined again with the tourniquet deflated to ensure its compressive effect was not partially responsible for the resolution. Published data pertaining to SFS is limited to case reports and small case series. With appropriate indications, surgical intervention yields promising results with a high percentage of patients returning to prior level of activity or prior participation level in sport. SFS can be diagnosed with a careful clinical assessment.

          "The medial ulnar collateral ligament (MUCL) is the primary restraint to valgus force on the elbow. Since the first description of MUCL reconstruction by Jobe et al in 1986, many technical advancements have been implemented to improve outcomes and reduce complications. The docking technique has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques. Following repetitive stress on the elbow during the overhead throwing motion, the MUCL may become attenuated, insufficient, or rupture completely. Although nonoperative treatment with rest and therapy is often the initial treatment of choice, individuals who fail conservative measures may require MUCL reconstruction. The major steps of the procedure are (1) harvesting of palmaris longus autograft, (2) incision and exposure, (3) preparation of ulnar tunnel, (4) preparation of docking site on medial epicondyle, (5) graft passage, (6) graft tensioning and length determination, (7) final fixation, and (8) closure. This procedure allows for reconstruction of the MUCL, restoration of valgus stability to the elbow, and return to play rates of 80% to 95%. The docking technique has advantages over previously described MUCL reconstruction techniques in that it minimizes injury to the flexor pronator mass, avoids the ulnar nerve, allows for robust graft tensioning, and reduces the amount of bone removed from the medial epicondyle.

          "Hip arthroscopy is technically demanding with a steep learning curve, and labral repair is an important component of the surgical treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. As hip arthroscopy indications and techniques are evolving, it is important to remain focused on teaching techniques that are easily mastered and have a measurable benefit to patient outcomes. Patients with FAI syndrome and labral tear who have failed conservative treatment may benefit from hip arthroscopy, labral repair, and femoroplasty. Labral repair is an essential component of the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome. The hip is accessed in standard fashion, and multiple knotless anchors are used for labral repair. Repair sutures are passed around the labrum in an inverted fashion. This inversion technique ensures the labrum is not everted away from the acetabular rim and that the final position of the labrum will restore a good suction seal on the femoral head. Femoroplasty and capsule closure are always performed. Patients can reliably expect improvements in hip pain and function. A cohort of 62 patients was investigated, and these patients demonstrated significant improvement in multiple patient-reported outcomes related to physical function, activity, and pain at 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Forty-seven percent stated they felt \u201ccompletely better\u201d at 2 years postoperatively. Good hip arthroscopy technique in the proper patient can yield excellent results.
