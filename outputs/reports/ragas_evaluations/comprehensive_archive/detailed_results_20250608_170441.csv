basic,What are the effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes?,"Metformin is a commonly prescribed medication for the management of type 2 diabetes. It is often used as a first-line treatment due to its effectiveness in lowering glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity. Document 1 highlights metformin's role in type 2 diabetes management.

Additionally, Document 3 discusses a case where a patient with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy experienced severe hypoglycemia due to incorrect insulin injection techniques, which led to the development of lipohypertrophy. The patient was switched to insulin analogs and educated on proper injection techniques, emphasizing the importance of correct medication administration in diabetes management.

Document 9 explores the potential neuroprotective role of metformin in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. A study involving patients with Parkinson's disease showed trends in biomarker changes after metformin use, suggesting a potential impact on the underlying pathophysiology of the disease.

Overall, metformin plays a crucial role in the management of type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity, lowering glucose production, and potentially offering neuroprotective effects in related conditions like Parkinson's disease. However, further research is needed to fully understand the extent of metformin's effects on type 2 diabetes and related conditions.","[""Document(page_content='Common treatments for type 2 diabetes include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, oral medications like metformin, and in some cases, insulin therapy.

In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population.

basic,How does SGLT2 inhibition affect kidney function?,"Based on the provided context documents, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to have a positive impact on kidney function. Document 1 mentions that the indications for SGLT2 inhibitors have expanded to include chronic kidney disease, and the prescription of these inhibitors has increased significantly over the years. The study analyzed nationwide prescription data in Japan and found that the number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings increased, with a significant proportion being prescribed to elderly patients. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors are being used more commonly in the treatment of kidney-related conditions.

Additionally, Document 6 discusses the use of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of primary glomerular diseases, which are a leading cause of chronic kidney disease. The study used amino acid profiles to differentiate between different types of glomerular diseases, including minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. This suggests that biomarkers, such as amino acids, can play a role in identifying and diagnosing kidney-related conditions, potentially aiding in the management of kidney function.

Furthermore, Document 7 highlights the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and physical performance in individuals with chronic kidney disease. The study found that reduced eGFR and higher albuminuria levels were associated with worse physical performance, indicating a potential link between kidney function and overall physical health.

Overall, the information provided in the context documents suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors, along with biomarkers and eGFR measurements, play a role in improving kidney function and managing kidney-related conditions. However, more specific details on the direct impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function, such as changes in glomerular filtration rate or proteinuria levels, are not explicitly mentioned in the context.

Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

basic,What is the mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists?,"GLP-1 receptor agonists, also known as incretin-based therapies, have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss in the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity. These therapies, including tirzepatide, slow gastric emptying, leading to lower postprandial glucose levels. They also have potential risks such as hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulfonylurea therapy. GLP-1-based therapy may also affect the gallbladder, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides but potentially increasing the risk of biliary disease.

The mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists involves activating the GLP-1 receptor, which leads to increased insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. This helps lower blood glucose levels after meals. Additionally, GLP-1 receptor agonists can promote weight loss and have cardiovascular and renal protective effects. They may also impact gastric, biliary, and small intestinal function, which can further contribute to their therapeutic effects.

In summary, GLP-1 receptor agonists work by mimicking the action of GLP-1, a hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and has various metabolic effects. They play a crucial role in managing type 2 diabetes and obesity by improving glycemic control, promoting weight loss, and providing cardiovascular and renal protection.

basic,What is the role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure?,"The context documents provided do not specifically mention the role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure. However, based on general medical knowledge, ACE inhibitors play a crucial role in the management of heart failure. 

ACE inhibitors, also known as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are a class of medications commonly used in the treatment of heart failure. They work by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that can lead to increased blood pressure and additional strain on the heart. By blocking this conversion, ACE inhibitors help dilate blood vessels, reduce blood pressure, and decrease the workload on the heart.

In heart failure, ACE inhibitors have been shown to improve symptoms, reduce hospitalizations, and prolong survival. They also help to prevent further remodeling of the heart muscle and can improve overall cardiac function. ACE inhibitors are often part of the standard treatment regimen for heart failure patients, especially those with reduced ejection fraction.

While the context documents provide valuable insights into various aspects of cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, Chagas cardiomyopathy, congenital heart defects, and cardiac fibrosis, they do not specifically address the role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure.

In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts.

basic,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids are known to suppress inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines. They exert their anti-inflammatory effects by interfering with the activity of transcription factors, such as NF-κB, that regulate the expression of various inflammatory genes. Document 1 discusses the anti-inflammatory properties of fucoxanthin, a natural compound that inhibits the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway, thereby reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators in immune cells. This mechanism of action is crucial for suppressing inflammation at the molecular level.

Additionally, Document 4 explores the anti-inflammatory effects of Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel compound derived from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb. MA was found to inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis, thereby reducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophage cells. This indicates that MA, similar to glucocorticoids, exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by targeting key signaling pathways involved in the inflammatory response.

While both documents highlight the importance of modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway to suppress inflammation, they do not specifically mention glucocorticoids. Therefore, the information provided in the context documents does not explicitly address how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells.

MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect.

basic,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"Levodopa is a medication commonly used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In Document 1, it is mentioned that patients with Parkinson's disease were divided into two groups, one receiving levodopa/carbidopa (250/25 mg) three times daily for 3 months, and the other receiving the same dose of levodopa/carbidopa along with 500 mg of metformin two times daily. The study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease, but the specific mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease is not explicitly mentioned in this context.

Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is deficient in Parkinson's disease due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Levodopa crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain, where it helps to alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. By increasing dopamine levels in the brain, levodopa helps to compensate for the dopamine deficiency caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons.

In conclusion, levodopa acts as a dopamine precursor in the brain, helping to restore dopamine levels and improve motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients. The context documents provide information about the use of levodopa in Parkinson's disease treatment but do not delve into the detailed mechanism of action of levodopa in the context of this study.","[""Document(page_content='Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

Conclusion The present study reports a high prevalence of MetS among PCOS cases (40.27%). Altered adipokine levels may be significantly associated with the early stages of MetS development and\xa0may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the management of MetS in PCOS. Therefore, the measurement of adipokines during preliminary investigations may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the\xa0management of MetS in PCOS.']",Metformin helps treat type 2 diabetes by reducing glucose production in the liver and increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.,3.7536749839782715,10,True,,,,,,,,0.45064155757427216,241,0

The use of SGLT2 inhibitors has been associated with cardiovascular and renal protection, as mentioned in Document 4. Additionally, Document 1 indicates that the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors has increased in the elderly population, who are more likely to have kidney-related conditions. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors may have beneficial effects on kidney function, especially in populations with chronic kidney disease.","['Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020.

This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan.

Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with age and gender, while associations with hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria were inconsistent. In the meta-analyses, a correlation between serum Gd-IgA1 and estimated glomerular filtration rate was identified, however, the relationships between Gd-IgA1 levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage and progression to kidney failure were inconsistent. Serum Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with validated prognostic risk factors, but were negatively correlated with kidney function.

The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity–response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.', 'Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes.

We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity–response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.', 'Lifestyle intervention prevents or delays type 2 diabetes (T2D) in subjects at a high risk of T2D. However, it is not known whether genetic variants modify the effect on incident T2D during lifestyle intervention. To investigate whether a low or high genetic risk has effects on incident T2D in a group-based lifestyle intervention study. The T2D-GENE trial involved 973 men from the Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) cohort, aged 50-75 years, body mass index ≥25 kg/m The intervention significantly lowered the risk of T2D among the participants with a high genetic risk for T2D [hazards ratio (HR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.56,  P P P Our results showed that individuals with a high genetic risk for T2D benefitted from a low-cost group-based intervention focusing on healthy diet and physical activity. Therefore, all individuals at risk of T2D should be encouraged to make lifestyle changes regardless of genetic risk.', 'IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common primary glomerular disease.

The literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus, and the selected articles were evaluated for eligibility based on predefined criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Statistical analysis was performed to calculate effect sizes and assess heterogeneity among the studies. This review analyzed 29 out of 1,986 studies, conducted between 2005 and 2022, with participants from multiple countries. Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with age and gender, while associations with hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria were inconsistent. In the meta-analyses, a correlation between serum Gd-IgA1 and estimated glomerular filtration rate was identified, however, the relationships between Gd-IgA1 levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage and progression to kidney failure were inconsistent. Serum Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with validated prognostic risk factors, but were negatively correlated with kidney function. Further research in larger studies using standardized assays are needed to establish the value of Gd-IgA1 as a prognostic risk factor in IgAN. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40620-023-01874-8.', 'Metabolic surgery, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), may improve hypertension (HTN) complicated by severe obesity; however, insufficient deliberation exists regarding the therapeutic effect of post-metabolic surgery on HTN.

Of the 102 patients who underwent LSG at Iwate Medical University Hospital between 2008 and 2020, 62 were enrolled in this study. Factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG were retrospectively analyzed. The HTN remission rate 12-months post-LSG was 40.3%. The remission cohort had a lower number of preoperative antihypertensive drugs (ADs) than that of the non-remission cohort (one and two tablets, respectively; p< 0.001). Additionally, the remission cohort had a statistically significantly smaller visceral fat area (VFA) than that of the non-remission cohort, at all time points. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were independent predictors of remission. The HTN recurrence rate 36-months post-LSG was 36.0%. In the recurrence cohort, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were higher and larger than that in the non-recurrence cohort, respectively. Stratification, based on the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, revealed that the HTN remission and recurrence rates in the sub-cohort with a small number of preoperative ADs and small VFA (100% and 16.7%, respectively) were better than those in the sub-cohort with a large number of preoperative ADs and large VFA (5.3% and 100%, respectively). In Japanese patients with severe obesity, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG. Stratification, by combining the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, may be useful in predicting HTN remission and recurrence.']","SGLT2 inhibitors provide cardiovascular benefits by reducing major adverse cardiovascular events and hospitalization for heart failure, effects that appear to be independent of their glucose-lowering action.",4.952134847640991,10,True,,,,,,,,0.515232652425766,463,0
hyde,How do statins prevent cardiovascular disease?,The provided documents do not specifically address how statins prevent cardiovascular disease.,"['Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a form of severe acute stroke with very high mortality and disability rates. Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.', 'The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.', ""Bone is a dynamic organ which continuously undergoes remodeling throughout one's lifetime. Cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential for regulating bone homeostasis. Osteoclasts, multinucleated giant cells differentiated from macrophage lineage, are responsible for osteolytic bone conditions which are closely linked to ROS signaling pathways. In this study, an anti‐ROS enzyme, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) was found to be expressed both in bone marrow macrophages and osteoclasts. Recombinant Prdx1 protein was found to dose‐dependently inhibit ROS production and osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, Prdx1 protein also attenuated NFATc1 activation as well as the expression of C‐Fos, V‐ATPase‐d2, Cathepsin K, and Integrin αV. Collectively, Prdx1 is a negative regulator on osteoclast formation via inhibiting RANKL‐mediated ROS activity, thus suggesting its potential application for treating osteoclast related disorders."", 'Lipid droplets (LDs) serve as crucial hubs for lipid trafficking and metabolic regulation through their numerous interactions with various organelles. While the interplay between LDs and the Golgi apparatus has been recognized, their roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the role of Ras-related protein Rab-2A (Rab2A) in mediating LD-Golgi interactions, thereby contributing to very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipidation and secretion in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, our findings identify a selective interaction between Golgi-localized Rab2A and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) protein residing on LDs. This complex facilitates dynamic organelle communication between the Golgi apparatus and LDs, thus contributing to lipid transfer from LDs to the Golgi apparatus for VLDL2 lipidation and secretion. Attenuation of Rab2A activity via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses the Rab2A-HSD17B13 complex formation, impairing LD-Golgi interactions and subsequent VLDL secretion. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Rab2A and HSD17B13 in the liver reduces the serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Collectively, this study provides a new perspective on the interactions between the Golgi apparatus and LDs.', 'The outcomes related to cardiovascular risk (CVR) in patients with the nonclassical form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH) are unknown, especially those related to therapeutic options, including low doses of glucocorticoids or oral contraceptive pills.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a common complication of SLE, significantly increases CHD-related mortality in SLE patients. Despite conventional risk factors, the mechanisms contributing to a higher CHD risk require further investigation, with the immune and inflammatory aspects of SLE playing a significant role. Endothelial cell damage and dysfunction are key factors in the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in SLE patients. This review specifically focuses on endothelial dysfunction and the role of specific microRNAs in the context of SLE and CHD. In addition, we discuss the effects and functions of oxidative stress markers, endothelial progenitor cells, and circulating endothelial cells in individuals with both SLE and CHD. We also explored the typical inflammatory markers associated with SLE and CHD, addressing their clinical significance and limitations.', 'Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a common cardiovascular condition marked by peripheral artery stenosis or occlusion. Despite treatment advancements, patients will still face vascular complications, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Human proteins play crucial roles in biology and drug research. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.', 'The clinical impact of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is still controversial. To evaluate the 1-year risk of all-cause death, thromboembolic events, and bleeding in patients with AF-NAFLD. Retrospective study with a health research network (TriNetX). Patients with AF on oral anticoagulation (OAC) were categorized according to the presence of NAFLD into 2 groups. The primary outcomes were the 1-year risks of (1) a composite cardiovascular outcome (all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, and pulmonary embolism) and (2) a composite hemorrhagic outcome (intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding). Cox regression analysis before and after propensity score matching was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 95% CI,. Sensitivity analyses investigated the risk associated with cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and type of OAC (warfarin vs non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). We identified 22 636 patients with AF-NAFLD (69 ± 12 years, 46.7% females) and 391 014 patients with AF and without liver disease (72 ± 12 years, 42.7% females). NAFLD was associated with a higher risk of composite cardiovascular (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.47-1.61) and hemorrhagic (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.42-1.72) outcomes. This was consistent also for all the single outcomes. Cirrhotic and thrombocytopenic patients with AF-NAFLD showed the highest risks. Compared to patients with AF-NAFLD on NOACs, those on warfarin were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular and hemorrhagic outcomes. In patients with AF, NAFLD is associated with a higher 1-year risk of adverse events, with the risk of adverse events progressively increasing from noncirrhotic to cirrhotic and from nonthrombocytopenic to thrombocytopenic patients. NOACs were associated with a better effectiveness and safety profile compared to warfarin.', 'Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.']","Statins prevent cardiovascular disease by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase to lower LDL cholesterol, reducing atherosclerotic plaque formation, and through pleiotropic effects such as anti-inflammatory and plaque-stabilizing properties.",4.506457090377808,10,True,,,,,,,,0.38269608914852143,94,0
hyde,What is the role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure?,"ACE inhibitors play a crucial role in heart failure by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which is responsible for converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. By inhibiting this enzyme, ACE inhibitors help to dilate blood vessels, reduce blood pressure, and decrease the workload on the heart. This can improve symptoms, slow the progression of heart failure, and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in patients with heart failure.","['Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.', 'Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.', 'The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes.

The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included “heart failure”, “ccTGA”, “VAD”, “heart transplantation”, and “systemic RV failure”. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data.

Compared to the period between index MACE and prior to PCSK9i mAb initiation, rates of subsequent MACE after PCSK9i mAb initiation were reduced in a time-dependent manner by 70% among patients who initiated PCSK9i mAb therapy within 30 days, 78% (31–90 days), 76% (91–180 days), 65% (181–360 days), and 42% (>360 days) after the index MACE. Those who initiated PCSK9i mAb within 30 days of the index MACE had longer median time to the first subsequent MACE (111 days) compared to patients who initiated at later times. This study provides evidence that earlier initiation of PCSK9i mAb therapy after a MACE appeared to be associated with longer time to a subsequent MACE. Patients without timely treatment are left at an unnecessarily elevated risk of further MACE.', 'Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is associated with an unbalanced\nimmune response and impaired heart function, and available drugs do\nnot prevent its development.

hyde,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α. They also inhibit the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by blocking IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby reducing the production of inflammatory mediators. Additionally, glucocorticoids can modulate immune cell functions, such as reducing the activity of immune cells like macrophages and T cells, which play a role in the inflammatory response. Overall, glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects by regulating the expression of inflammatory mediators and modulating immune cell functions.","['Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', 'Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.', ""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials."", 'Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions. In this review, we highlight current findings on the role of ILCs and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma development and pathogenesis. We also examine the underlying mechanisms regulating their function and their interplay with other immune cells. Finally, we explore current therapies targeting these cells and their effector cytokines for asthma management.', 'The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the development, progression, and metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The TME comprises various cellular and acellular components, including immune cells, stromal cells, cytokines, extracellular matrix, and the oral microbiome, all of which dynamically interact with tumor cells to influence their behavior. Immunosuppression is a key feature of the OSCC TME, with regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contributing to an environment that allows tumor cells to evade immune surveillance and supports angiogenesis. The oral microbiome also plays a pivotal role in OSCC pathogenesis, as dysbiosis, or imbalances in the microbiota, can lead to chronic inflammation, which promotes carcinogenesis through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.', 'Cannabinoid administration has demonstrated promising anti-tumor effects for glioblastoma (GBM) by inhibiting glioma cell proliferation and inducing glioma cell death. However, the impact of cannabinoids and endocannabinoid receptors on immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains largely unexplored. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), the most abundant immune cells in the TME, and their mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells have shown potential in preclinical xenografts of various human malignancies. This study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of endocannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) on TAMs-mediated phagocytosis in xenografted mice with GL261-GFP cell lines. We measured the phagocytic activity using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, and we used the IVIS Spectrum System for bioluminescent imaging to track the growth of the tumor. Our findings demonstrated that administering JWH133, a selective CB2R agonist, significantly boosted TAMs-mediated phagocytosis. However, administering AM630, a selective CB2R antagonist, significantly inhibited TAMs-mediated phagocytosis. Mechanistically, CB2R activation upregulated the expression of CD36 on TAMs, a scavenger receptor known to facilitate phagocytosis. Furthermore, sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), an irreversible CD36 inhibitor, could reverse the CB2R activation-induced enhancement of phagocytosis by TAMs. Additionally. JHW133 also effectively augmented the chemotherapeutic efficacy of temozolomide. Overall, our findings show that CB2R activation promotes TAMs-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells by enhancing CD36 expression, implying that JWH133 could be a useful therapeutic approach to improving chemotherapeutic efficacy against GBM.', 'Spontaneous preterm labor (SPTL) is a major cause of neonatal mortality and severe complications.

This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants’ workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.', 'Bacterial resistance to antibiotics remains a significant clinical challenge, contributing to persistently high rates of morbidity and mortality.

By inhibiting these inflammatory pathways, biologics help reduce inflammation, alleviate symptoms, and slow down joint destruction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","['This study aims to identify factors influencing the alleviation of knee joint symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biologic or target synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs). Among 2321 patients who started b/tsDMARDs between 2010 and 2023, we focused on 295 patients who had knee swelling or tenderness at the initiation of b/tsDMARDs and continued b/tsDMARDs at least 3 months, with recorded knee symptoms 6 months later. Symptom relief after 6 months was 78.2% for interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitors, 68.6% for Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, 65.8% for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and 57.6% for cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-Ig (CTLA4-Ig). The initial use of b/tsDMARDs and the use of IL-6 inhibitors in comparison to CTLA4-Ig emerged as a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms. Among 141 patients who underwent knee radiography at baseline and two years later, the deterioration in knee joint radiographs was 7.7% for IL-6 inhibitors, 6.3% for JAK inhibitors, 21.9% for TNF inhibitors, and 25.9% for CTLA4-Ig.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA and AS patients were treated with UA, and cell viability was measured using the MTS assay and flow cytometry. The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of −5.251 kcal/mol and −6.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients. In the arthritis mouse model, significantly reduced clinical and histological scores were observed in the UA treatment group. Our findings suggest that UA has potential as a binding target for TNF, suppresses inflammatory cytokines in PBMCs, and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on arthritis in a mouse model.', 'Preoperative levels of certain inflammatory markers in the blood can predict acute infection after primary total joint arthroplasty in patients without inflammatory disease, but whether they can do so in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut‐off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio, C‐reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020. We compared preoperative levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C‐reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) between patients who suffered acute infection or not within 90\u2009days after surgery. The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut‐off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut‐off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut‐off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L). The neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%. The preoperative NLR shows some ability to predict acute infection after total joint arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

hyde,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine that is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and be converted into dopamine in the brain. In Parkinson's disease, there is a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a decrease in dopamine levels. Levodopa helps to replenish dopamine levels in the brain, which helps to alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.","['Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\xa0mg) three times daily for 3\xa0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\xa0mg) three times daily and 500\xa0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group). Patients were assessed via Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The serum concentrations of toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4), α-synuclein, brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) were measured before and after treatment.

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.', 'Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative condition, is primarily characterized by motor dysfunctions due to dopaminergic neuronal loss in the Substantia Nigra (SN), with oxidative stress playing a significant role in its progression.

The limited efficacy could be due to regional differences in the dysregulation of the dopamine system. This study investigated striatal and peripheral dopaminergic makers in schizophrenia and their relationship with cognitive impairment. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated. We evaluated their cognitive performance, examined the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT, and measured plasma levels of dopaminergic precursors (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) that compete with precursors for brain uptake via ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Schizophrenia patients exhibited lower cognitive performance, decreased striatal DAT availability, and reduced levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA. Within the patient group, lower DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen was positively associated with attention deficits. Meanwhile, lower tyrosine levels and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA were positively related to executive dysfunction. Among all participants, DAT availability in the right CN or putamen was positively related to memory function, and plasma phenylalanine level was positively associated with executive function. This study supports the role of dopamine system abnormalities in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The distinct associations between different dopaminergic alterations and specific cognitive domain impairments suggest the potential need for multifaceted treatment approaches to target these impairments.', 'Tic disorders represent a developmental neuropsychiatric condition whose causes can be attributed to a variety of environmental, neurobiological, and genetic factors. From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In this paper, therefore, we summarize the evidence to date on these abnormalities with the intent to illustrate and clarify the main neuroanatomical differences between patients with tic disorders and healthy individuals.', 'Bright light therapy (BLT) has been proved to have beneficial effects on Parkinson’s disease (PD), the mechanisms remained unclear. Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (Δscales), OCT (Δretinal thickness), PERG (ΔPERG values) and VEP (ΔP100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral ΔN95 latencies for PERG and ΔP100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT. BLT is a valuable and safe non-pharmacological intervention for improving visual function in PD patients. These findings extend neural mechanisms of BLT to visual pathways improvements.

Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\xa0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\xa0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\xa0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\xa0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points. This study is the first prospective RCT to investigate the safety of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in TBI patients.

The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials."", 'Previous studies have shown an association between the thalamocortical dysconnectivity and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Whether a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine may change thalamocortical connectivity among patients with TRD is unclear. Whether these changes in thalamocortical connectivity is associated with the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine treatment is also unclear. Two resting-state functional MRIs were collected in two clinical trials of 48 patients with TRD (clinical trial 1; 32 receiving ketamine, 16 receiving a normal saline placebo) and 48 patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation (clinical trial 2; 24 receiving ketamine, 24 receiving midazolam), respectively. All participants underwent rs-fMRI before and 3 days after infusion. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) was analyzed in the left/right thalamus. FCs between the bilateral thalamus and right middle frontal cortex (BA46) and between the left thalamus and left anterior paracingulate gyrus (BA8) increased among patients in the ketamine group in clinical trials 1 and 2, respectively. FCs between the right thalamus and bilateral frontal pole (BA9) and between the right thalamus and left rostral paracingulate gyrus (BA10) decreased among patients in the ketamine group in clinical trials 1 and 2, respectively. However, the associations between those FC changes and clinical symptom changes did not survive statistical significance after multiple comparison corrections. Whether ketamine-related changes in thalamocortical connectivity may be associated with ketamine’s antidepressant and antisuicidal effects would need further investigation.

crag,What are the effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes?,"Metformin is a common medication used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is often prescribed as a first-line treatment due to its ability to lower glucose production in the liver and improve insulin sensitivity. This can help control blood sugar levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise are also important in managing type 2 diabetes.

Document 2 discusses the complex management of diabetes mellitus in the perioperative setting, highlighting the need to balance glucose control with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. Various diabetic medications, including insulin, are mentioned in this document as part of the management strategy.

Document 3 presents a case study of a patient with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy who experienced severe and recurrent hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy. Lipodystrophy is a rare condition that affects fat distribution in the body and can impact insulin absorption, leading to hypoglycemic events in individuals with diabetes.

Document 4 discusses the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and other incretin-based therapies in the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity. These medications have been shown to have beneficial effects beyond improving glycemic control, suggesting their potential role in the treatment of these conditions.

Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

crag,How do statins prevent cardiovascular disease?,"Statins prevent cardiovascular disease by lowering cholesterol levels in the blood. They work by inhibiting an enzyme in the liver that is responsible for producing cholesterol. By reducing cholesterol levels, statins can help prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to atherosclerosis and ultimately cardiovascular disease. Additionally, statins have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can help protect the blood vessels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

However, the provided documents do not directly address how statins prevent cardiovascular disease. Document 1 discusses the benefits of the Mediterranean diet in promoting healthy aging, while Document 2 explores the association between anabolic androgenic steroid use and coronary microvascular dysfunction.

Given the lack of specific information in the provided documents, it is uncertain whether ACE inhibitors are directly discussed in relation to heart failure. However, based on broader search results and medical knowledge, ACE inhibitors are commonly used in the management of heart failure. ACE inhibitors work by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which helps to relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure, reducing the workload on the heart. Additionally, ACE inhibitors can help improve symptoms, decrease hospitalizations, and improve survival in patients with heart failure.

crag,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by exerting anti-inflammatory effects on various immune cells and signaling pathways. Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones that are produced endogenously in the body or can be administered exogenously as medications. These hormones bind to glucocorticoid receptors present on immune cells, including macrophages, T cells, and B cells, as well as non-immune cells, such as epithelial cells and endothelial cells.

When glucocorticoids bind to their receptors, they modulate gene expression, leading to the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Additionally, glucocorticoids promote the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and lipocortin-1, which help resolve inflammation and promote tissue repair.

Glucocorticoids also inhibit the activity of key transcription factors involved in inflammation, such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). These transcription factors play a central role in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and are critical for the initiation and propagation of the inflammatory response.

Furthermore, glucocorticoids have been shown to suppress the migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation, reduce the production of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and inhibit the activation of inflammasomes, such as the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases like atherosclerosis.

In conclusion, glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects by modulating gene expression, inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors, promoting the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins, and suppressing the migration and activation of immune cells. The information provided in the documents did not directly address the mechanism of action of glucocorticoids in suppressing inflammation, so the response is based on broader search results and general knowledge of glucocorticoid biology.","[""Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.42549756169319153, 'retrieval_method': 'knowledge_base_expansion'}, id='PMC1748704565')"", 'Document(page_content=""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

crag,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"Levodopa is a medication commonly used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The mechanism of action of levodopa involves its conversion into dopamine in the brain. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a decrease in dopamine levels in the brain. Levodopa, as a precursor to dopamine, can cross the blood-brain barrier and be converted into dopamine in the remaining dopaminergic neurons, thus helping to alleviate the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease.

Although the provided documents discuss various aspects of neurodegenerative diseases and treatment options, none of them specifically address the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Therefore, it is important to rely on established knowledge and research in the field of neurology to understand the pharmacological mechanism of levodopa in the context of Parkinson's disease.","[""Document(page_content='Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target.

Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.42549756169319153, 'retrieval_method': 'colbert_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC1748704565')"", 'Document(page_content=""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries.

In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\'s disease, Parkinson\'s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies.

Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population.

In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment.

Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells.

MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect.

Metformin is often the first-line medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It helps lower glucose production in the liver and improves insulin sensitivity.', 'Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world.

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education."", 'Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1- and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist tirzepatide (referred to here collectively as “GLP-1-based therapy”) are incretin-based therapies being used increasingly in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378–2.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators—LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI — partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.', 'Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.', 'In recent years, advancements in immunosuppressive medications and post-transplant management have led to a significant decrease in acute rejection rates in renal allografts and consequent improvement in short-term graft survival.

The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world.

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases.

Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety.

They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease.

Studies reveal that COVID‐19 patients often suffer from certain vascular diseases, partly attributed to increased proliferation or altered phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Although the association between COVID‐19 and VSMCs is recognized, the precise mechanism underlying SARS‐CoV‐2's influence on VSMC phenotype remains largely under‐reviewed. In this context, while there is a consistent body of literature dissecting the effect of COVID‐19 on the cardiovascular system, few reports delve into the potential role of VSMC switching in the pathophysiology associated with COVID‐19 and the molecular mechanisms involved therein. This review dissects and critiques the link between COVID‐19 and VSMCs, with particular attention to pathways involving cholesterol, calcium, and phosphate. These pathways underpin the interaction between the virus and VSMCs. Such interaction promotes VSMC proliferation, and eventually potentiates vascular calcification as well as worsens prognosis in patients with COVID‐19."", 'Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01).

We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to repeatedly measure 1,542 lipid species from 1,886 American Indian adults attending 2 clinical examinations (mean ~5 years apart) in the Strong Heart Family Study. We used generalized estimating equation models to identify baseline lipid species associated with change in ABI and the Cox frailty regression to examine whether lipids associated with change in ABI were also associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD).

This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use.

The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included “heart failure”, “ccTGA”, “VAD”, “heart transplantation”, and “systemic RV failure”. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data.

The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis.

hybrid_ifind,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB pathway.,"['Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', ""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials."", 'Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.', 'Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions. In this review, we highlight current findings on the role of ILCs and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma development and pathogenesis. We also examine the underlying mechanisms regulating their function and their interplay with other immune cells. Finally, we explore current therapies targeting these cells and their effector cytokines for asthma management.', 'Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.', 'Adipose tissue inflammation is now considered to be a key process underlying metabolic diseases in obese individuals.

Cytokine levels in PICF or GCF of the same individual were compared using the paired t-test, and those from titanium or gold-casting (UCLA) abutment were compared using the independent t-test. Human gingival fibroblast responses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and IFNγ expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same individual. However, IL-1β (p = 0.032) and IL-1α (p = 0.030) was statistically significantly higher in PICF than in GCF.

This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants’ workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR.

The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of −5.251 kcal/mol and −6.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut‐off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio, C‐reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020.

Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\xa0mg) three times daily for 3\xa0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\xa0mg) three times daily and 500\xa0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group). Patients were assessed via Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The serum concentrations of toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4), α-synuclein, brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) were measured before and after treatment. The improvement in UPDRS from baseline to 3\xa0months. Change in the level of biological markers. The control group did not show significant difference in UPDRS when compared to their baseline value by Wilcoxon test ( P P P P While no significant differences in UPDRS scores were observed between the metformin and control groups, trends in biomarker changes suggest a potential impact of adjunctive metformin use on the underlying pathophysiology of PD. Further studies are needed to assess its effects on motor symptoms over a longer duration. identifier  NCT05781711', 'Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative condition, is primarily characterized by motor dysfunctions due to dopaminergic neuronal loss in the Substantia Nigra (SN), with oxidative stress playing a significant role in its progression.

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.', 'Tic disorders represent a developmental neuropsychiatric condition whose causes can be attributed to a variety of environmental, neurobiological, and genetic factors. From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In this paper, therefore, we summarize the evidence to date on these abnormalities with the intent to illustrate and clarify the main neuroanatomical differences between patients with tic disorders and healthy individuals.', 'Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting the peripheral and central nervous system and is caused by bi-allelic variants in the  GAN GAN The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00415-024-12744-z.', 'Bright light therapy (BLT) has been proved to have beneficial effects on Parkinson’s disease (PD), the mechanisms remained unclear. Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (Δscales), OCT (Δretinal thickness), PERG (ΔPERG values) and VEP (ΔP100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral ΔN95 latencies for PERG and ΔP100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT. BLT is a valuable and safe non-pharmacological intervention for improving visual function in PD patients. These findings extend neural mechanisms of BLT to visual pathways improvements.

We aimed to further elucidate the role of dysregulated DNA methylation in Parkinson's disease and to evaluate the biomarker potential of methylation‐based profiling. We conducted an epigenome‐wide association study (EWAS) in whole blood, including 280 Parkinson's disease and 279 control participants from Oslo, Norway. Next, we took advantage of data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and a previously published EWAS to conduct a whole blood EWAS meta‐analysis in Parkinson's disease, incorporating results from a total of 3068 participants. Finally, we generated multiple methylation‐based scores for each Oslo and PPMI participant and tested their association with disease status, individually and in a joint multiscore model. In EWAS meta‐analysis, we confirm  SLC7A11 LPIN1 Our results highlight the power of DNA methylation profiling to capture multiple aspects of disease risk, indicating a biomarker potential for precision medicine in neurodegenerative disorders. The reproducibility of specific differentially methylated CpGs across data sets was limited but may improve if future studies are designed to account for disease stage and incorporate environmental exposure data."", 'Neurodegenerative disorders encompass a group of age‐related conditions characterized by the gradual decline in both the structure and functionality of the central nervous system (CNS). RNA modifications, arising from the epitranscriptome or RNA‐modifying protein mutations, have recently been observed to contribute significantly to neurodegenerative disorders. Specific modifications like N6‐methyladenine (m6A), N1‐methyladenine (m1A), 5‐methylcytosine (m5C), pseudouridine and adenosine‐to‐inosine (A‐to‐I) play key roles, with their regulators serving as crucial therapeutic targets. These epitranscriptomic changes intricately control gene expression, influencing cellular functions and contributing to disease pathology. Dysregulation of RNA metabolism, affecting mRNA processing and noncoding RNA biogenesis, is a central factor in these diseases. This review underscores the complex relationship between RNA modifications and neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing the influence of RNA modification and the epitranscriptome, exploring the function of RNA modification enzymes in neurodegenerative processes, investigating the functional consequences of RNA modifications within neurodegenerative pathways, and evaluating the potential therapeutic advancements derived from assessing the epitranscriptome.', 'Although a role of the thalamus in different arousal and awareness states is well established, there is a surprising lack of knowledge on subregional specificity within this complex, multinucleated structure of the diencephalon.
