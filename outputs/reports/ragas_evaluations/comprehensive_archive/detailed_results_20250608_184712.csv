basic,What are the effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes?,"Metformin is a commonly prescribed medication for the management of type 2 diabetes. It is often the first-line medication used to help lower glucose production in the liver and improve insulin sensitivity. Metformin has been shown to have beneficial effects beyond just improving glycemic control. Studies have demonstrated that metformin exerts a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. In a study involving patients with Parkinson's disease, the addition of metformin as adjuvant therapy to levodopa/carbidopa treatment showed trends in biomarker changes that suggest a potential impact on the underlying pathophysiology of PD. 

Additionally, metformin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals through lifestyle interventions. Individuals with a high genetic risk for type 2 diabetes have been found to benefit from low-cost group-based interventions focusing on healthy diet and physical activity, regardless of their genetic risk. This indicates that lifestyle changes combined with metformin therapy can be beneficial for preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes.

Overall, metformin plays a crucial role in the management of type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity, lowering glucose production, and potentially offering neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. It is an important medication that can be used in combination with lifestyle interventions to effectively manage and prevent the progression of type 2 diabetes.","[""Document(page_content='Common treatments for type 2 diabetes include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, oral medications like metformin, and in some cases, insulin therapy.

basic,How does SGLT2 inhibition affect kidney function?,"SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to have a significant impact on kidney function based on the information provided in the context documents. Document 1 highlights the expansion of indications for SGLT2 inhibitors, specifically in the treatment of heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. The study mentioned in Document 1 indicates that the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan has increased significantly, with a notable proportion of elderly patients receiving these medications. The expansion of indications has led to a higher number of prescribed tablets, especially in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease, showcasing the potential positive impact on kidney function.

Additionally, Document 7 provides insights into the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria categories with physical performance outcomes. The document suggests that reduced eGFR and higher albuminuria levels are associated with worse physical performance, indicating a potential decline in kidney function. This observation underscores the importance of interventions, such as SGLT2 inhibitors, that can potentially improve kidney function and overall health outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease.

While there is evidence supporting the positive effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function, such as improving glomerular filtration rate and reducing albuminuria, there is a need for more detailed studies specifically focusing on the direct impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function in patients with kidney diseases. Understanding the mechanisms through which SGLT2 inhibitors affect kidney function, including their effects on renal hemodynamics, tubular function, and inflammation, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of their role in kidney disease management.

Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies.

Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

basic,What is the mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists?,"GLP-1 receptor agonists, including tirzepatide, are incretin-based therapies used in the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity. These therapies have beneficial effects beyond glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1 receptor agonists slow gastric emptying, leading to lower postprandial glucose levels. However, this effect also poses a risk of hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulfonylurea therapy. Additionally, GLP-1 receptor agonists may have effects on the gallbladder, potentially reducing postprandial triglycerides but also increasing the risk of biliary disease.

The mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists involves binding to the GLP-1 receptor, which leads to various physiological effects. These effects include improved glycemic control, weight loss, cardiovascular protection, renal protection, and modulation of gastric, biliary, and small intestinal function. By activating the GLP-1 receptor, these agonists stimulate insulin secretion, inhibit glucagon secretion, slow gastric emptying, and promote satiety.

GLP-1 receptor agonists are part of a class of drugs known as incretin-based therapies, which work by mimicking the effects of incretin hormones in the body. Incretin hormones, such as GLP-1, are released from the gut in response to food intake and play a role in regulating glucose metabolism. By targeting the GLP-1 receptor, agonists like tirzepatide can enhance the body's natural incretin response, leading to improved glucose control and other metabolic benefits.

Overall, the mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists involves activating the GLP-1 receptor to improve glycemic control, promote weight loss, and provide additional cardiovascular and renal protection.

In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment.

This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts.

basic,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context documents in relation to how they suppress inflammation. However, based on general knowledge of the pharmacological properties of glucocorticoids, it can be explained that glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects through multiple mechanisms. 

Glucocorticoids are synthetic analogs of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. They are potent immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents that are commonly used in the treatment of various inflammatory conditions. Glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm of target cells. Once bound to the receptor, the glucocorticoid-receptor complex translocates to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor, regulating the expression of multiple genes involved in the inflammatory response.

One of the key mechanisms by which glucocorticoids suppress inflammation is by inhibiting the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, such as cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α), chemokines, and enzymes involved in the inflammatory cascade. This results in decreased production of inflammatory mediators, thereby reducing the inflammatory response.

Glucocorticoids also inhibit the activity of transcription factors, such as NF-κB and AP-1, which are critical for the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. By interfering with the activation of these transcription factors, glucocorticoids effectively block the signaling pathways that lead to the production of inflammatory mediators.

Furthermore, glucocorticoids have been shown to induce the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins, such as lipocortin-1, which inhibits phospholipase A2 and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

Overall, glucocorticoids modulate the immune response and suppress inflammation by targeting multiple pathways involved in the inflammatory cascade, leading to the downregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators and the promotion of anti-inflammatory mechanisms.","[""Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells.

These genes are detected using techniques such as high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS).

In addition to genetic mechanisms, bacteria can also develop resistance through other means such as efflux mechanisms and changes in gene expression.

The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut‐off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut‐off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut‐off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\\u2009g/L). The neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%.

basic,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"Levodopa is a key medication used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). It is a precursor to dopamine and is converted to dopamine in the brain, where it helps to alleviate the motor symptoms of PD caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in coordinating movement and balance in the body.

In Document 1, it is mentioned that patients with PD received levodopa/carbidopa as part of their treatment regimen. Levodopa/carbidopa is a combination medication where carbidopa helps to prevent the breakdown of levodopa before it reaches the brain, allowing more levodopa to enter the brain and be converted to dopamine.

While Document 1 focuses on the potential role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in PD, it does not specifically delve into the mechanism of action of levodopa. However, based on the known pharmacology of levodopa, it can be inferred that the medication works by increasing the levels of dopamine in the brain, compensating for the dopamine deficiency caused by the neurodegenerative process in PD. This increase in dopamine helps to improve motor symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement that are characteristic of PD.

In summary, levodopa acts as a dopamine precursor in the brain, helping to replenish dopamine levels and alleviate motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients.","[""Document(page_content='Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

basic,How does SGLT2 inhibition affect kidney function?,"SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to have a significant impact on kidney function. Document 1 discusses the expansion of indications for SGLT2 inhibitors to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. The study analyzed nationwide prescription data in Japan and found that the total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed increased over time, with a significant portion of prescriptions going to the elderly population. This indicates that SGLT2 inhibitors are increasingly being used to manage heart failure and chronic kidney disease in older patients.

Document 7 provides further insight into the impact of kidney function on physical performance. It mentions that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and higher levels of albuminuria were associated with worse physical performance, suggesting that declining kidney function can have a negative effect on overall physical health.

Additionally, Document 10 discusses the use of kidney-specific biomarkers to evaluate acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC). The study found that certain biomarkers, such as urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and serum cystatin C (sCyC), can be useful in detecting AKI post-procedure.

Overall, SGLT2 inhibitors play a role in managing heart failure and chronic kidney disease, potentially improving kidney function in patients.

Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

basic,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones that have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. They are commonly used in the treatment of various inflammatory conditions due to their ability to suppress inflammation by targeting multiple pathways involved in the inflammatory response.

Document 1 provides insights into the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of natural compounds, specifically fucoxanthin, which is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Fucoxanthin was found to effectively suppress the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators in THP-1 cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IκB-α, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. This mechanism is crucial in regulating the expression of inflammatory genes and reducing inflammation.

Document 4 discusses the anti-inflammatory effects of Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, which was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma. MA was shown to inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis, leading to the suppression of inflammatory responses in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. This mechanism involves the direct interaction between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), resulting in the inactivation of NF-κB-mediated inflammation.

While both documents provide insights into the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of natural compounds, they do not specifically mention the role of glucocorticoids in suppressing inflammation. Additional information on glucocorticoids and their mechanisms of action, such as their ability to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suppress immune cell activation, and regulate gene expression related to inflammation, would be necessary to provide a comprehensive answer to how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation.","[""Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

basic,What are the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance?,"Based on the information provided in the context documents, several mechanisms of antibiotic resistance are mentioned. 

1. Presence of Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs): The documents highlight the importance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in limiting the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobials. These genes can be associated with various phenotypes, such as macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramin B (MLSB), multi-drug resistance (MDR), and resistance to aminoglycosides. The presence of these genes in bacteria can confer resistance to antibiotics, making treatment more challenging.

2. Efflux Mechanisms: In the context of antifungal resistance, it is mentioned that wild-type strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans exhibited fluconazole tolerance by up-regulating efflux mechanisms. This mechanism allows the fungi to pump out the drug and reduce its effectiveness, leading to resistance.

3. Adaptation and Tolerance: The documents discuss how fungi, such as Candida albicans, can adapt to antifungal drugs like azoles by exhibiting tolerance. This adaptive response involves changes in gene expression, including up-regulation of efflux mechanisms and down-regulation of certain genes like ERG.

4. Carbapenem Resistance: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is specifically mentioned as a type of antimicrobial resistance that has been increasing. This resistance may be due to the production of carbapenemases, enzymes that can inactivate carbapenem antibiotics.

While the documents provide insights into various mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, additional information on specific resistance mechanisms, such as mutations in target sites, production of enzymes that modify or degrade antibiotics, and biofilm formation, could further enhance the understanding of how bacteria and fungi develop resistance to antibiotics.","[""Document(page_content='Antimicrobial resistance has recently increased due to emerging carbapenem-resistant  Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae K. pneumoniae K. pneumoniae I K. pneumoniae P P K. pneumoniae', metadata={}, id='3178')"", ""Document(page_content='The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria in humans, animals, and the environment underscores the necessity for a rapid, sensitive, and specific method to identify resistance genes.

basic,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"Levodopa is a key medication used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is converted into dopamine in the brain, which helps compensate for the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, a characteristic feature of Parkinson's disease. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in motor control and coordination. By increasing the levels of dopamine in the brain, levodopa helps alleviate the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.

Levodopa is typically administered in combination with carbidopa, which helps prevent the breakdown of levodopa in the bloodstream before it reaches the brain. This combination therapy allows for more levodopa to reach the brain and be converted into dopamine, thereby improving motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients.

In the context provided, a study investigated the use of levodopa/carbidopa in combination with metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease. The study focused on assessing the impact of metformin on various biological markers and motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients. While the study did not specifically elaborate on the mechanism of action of levodopa, it highlighted the importance of developing new disease-modifying treatments for Parkinson's disease and exploring potential adjunctive therapies to improve outcomes for patients.

Therefore, based on the information available in the context documents, the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease involves its conversion into dopamine in the brain to compensate for the loss of dopamine-producing neurons and alleviate motor symptoms.

To answer the question comprehensively, additional information on the mechanism of action of statins would be needed. Statins are a class of medications commonly used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood, specifically low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. By inhibiting an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, statins reduce the production of cholesterol in the liver, leading to decreased levels of LDL cholesterol. This mechanism helps to prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which is a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes.

basic,What is the role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure?,"The context documents provide information on various aspects of heart failure, including different treatments and mechanisms involved in heart failure. However, the specific role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

ACE inhibitors, also known as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are commonly used in the treatment of heart failure. These medications work by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that can lead to increased blood pressure and cardiac workload. By inhibiting this conversion, ACE inhibitors help dilate blood vessels, reduce blood pressure, and decrease the workload on the heart.

basic,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"The context documents do not specifically mention how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation. The documents primarily focus on the role of various natural compounds, signaling pathways, immune responses, and inflammatory mediators in different disease conditions, including asthma, atherosclerosis, periodontitis, and Long COVID. Glucocorticoids are a class of corticosteroids that have potent anti-inflammatory properties and are commonly used in the treatment of various inflammatory conditions. 

To answer the question comprehensively, we can provide general information about how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation based on existing knowledge. Glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects through multiple mechanisms, including:

1. Inhibition of pro-inflammatory gene expression: Glucocorticoids can enter cells and bind to glucocorticoid receptors, resulting in the formation of glucocorticoid-receptor complexes that translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, these complexes can inhibit the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, such as cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α), chemokines, and adhesion molecules, thereby reducing inflammation.

2. Suppression of immune cell activation: Glucocorticoids can inhibit the activation and function of various immune cells involved in the inflammatory response, including macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells. This suppression can lead to decreased production of inflammatory mediators and a dampening of the immune response.

3. Induction of anti-inflammatory proteins: Glucocorticoids can induce the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins, such as lipocortin-1 (annexin-1), which can inhibit phospholipase A2 activity and reduce the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

4. Modulation of signaling pathways: Glucocorticoids can interfere with signaling pathways involved in inflammation, such as the NF-κB pathway, which is a key regulator of pro-inflammatory gene expression. By inhibiting NF-κB activation, glucocorticoids can reduce the production of inflammatory mediators.

5. Stabilization of cell membranes: Glucocorticoids can stabilize cell membranes and reduce the release of inflammatory mediators from immune cells, thereby limiting the spread of inflammation.

While the context documents do not directly address how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation, the general mechanisms described above are well-established in the literature. Additional information from specific studies or clinical trials focusing on glucocorticoid therapy in inflammatory conditions could provide more detailed insights into the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids.","[""Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect.

In Document 1, the study focused on patients with RA who were treated with biologic or target synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) to alleviate knee joint symptoms. The study found that different types of biologics, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitors, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-Ig (CTLA4-Ig), had varying levels of effectiveness in improving knee joint symptoms and inhibiting joint destruction. Among these, IL-6 inhibitors emerged as a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms and the inhibition of joint destruction compared to CTLA4-Ig.

In Document 2, Usenamine A (UA), a natural compound isolated from lichen, was studied for its effects on inflammatory cytokines and arthritis in both in vitro and in vivo models. The results showed that UA did not affect cell viability but suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of RA patients. Additionally, UA exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in an arthritis mouse model, indicating its potential as a treatment for RA by targeting inflammatory pathways.

basic,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"Levodopa is a key medication used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In Document 1, it is mentioned that patients with PD were divided into two groups, one of which received levodopa/carbidopa three times daily for three months. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is deficient in Parkinson's disease due to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. By providing levodopa, the medication aims to increase dopamine levels in the brain, thereby helping to alleviate motor symptoms associated with PD.

While Document 1 does not go into detail about the specific mechanism of action of levodopa, it is known that levodopa crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted into dopamine in the brain. This conversion occurs in dopaminergic neurons that are still functional in the brain, allowing for the replenishment of dopamine levels and improvement in motor symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement.

Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\xa0mg) three times daily for 3\xa0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\xa0mg) three times daily and 500\xa0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group). Patients were assessed via Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The serum concentrations of toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4), α-synuclein, brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) were measured before and after treatment.

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan.

The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.', ""We report the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy with a history of recurrent and severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy with an uncommon clinical presentation.

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378–2.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators—LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI — partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.']",Metformin helps treat type 2 diabetes by reducing glucose production in the liver and increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.,4.614277124404907,10,True,,,,,,,,0.459957218170166,175,0

In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity–response relationship.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.']","SGLT2 inhibitors protect kidney function by reducing hyperfiltration, decreasing albuminuria, and providing nephroprotection through mechanisms independent of glycemic control.",5.745090961456299,10,True,,,,,,,,0.4999959826469421,778,0

These medications have been shown to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. They are increasingly being prescribed to elderly patients in Japan, with a significant portion of the prescriptions being for patients aged 75 years and older.","['Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.', 'Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1- and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist tirzepatide (referred to here collectively as “GLP-1-based therapy”) are incretin-based therapies being used increasingly in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity. They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease. In this review, we summarize the effects of GLP-1 and incretin-based therapeutics on gastric, biliary and small intestinal function. An improved understanding of these effects will optimize the use of these drugs.', 'Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world. While the key elements are agreed upon, more research and global collaboration are needed to create consistent guidelines and improve patient outcomes.', 'Common treatments for type 2 diabetes include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, oral medications like metformin, and in some cases, insulin therapy.

This study aimed to analyze the factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG in patients who have severe obesity, and to create a classification system to predict HTN remission and recurrence. Of the 102 patients who underwent LSG at Iwate Medical University Hospital between 2008 and 2020, 62 were enrolled in this study. Factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG were retrospectively analyzed. The HTN remission rate 12-months post-LSG was 40.3%. The remission cohort had a lower number of preoperative antihypertensive drugs (ADs) than that of the non-remission cohort (one and two tablets, respectively; p< 0.001). Additionally, the remission cohort had a statistically significantly smaller visceral fat area (VFA) than that of the non-remission cohort, at all time points. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were independent predictors of remission. The HTN recurrence rate 36-months post-LSG was 36.0%. In the recurrence cohort, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were higher and larger than that in the non-recurrence cohort, respectively. Stratification, based on the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, revealed that the HTN remission and recurrence rates in the sub-cohort with a small number of preoperative ADs and small VFA (100% and 16.7%, respectively) were better than those in the sub-cohort with a large number of preoperative ADs and large VFA (5.3% and 100%, respectively). In Japanese patients with severe obesity, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG. Stratification, by combining the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, may be useful in predicting HTN remission and recurrence.', 'Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.', 'The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies.

The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity–response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.', 'IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common primary glomerular disease.

Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with age and gender, while associations with hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria were inconsistent. In the meta-analyses, a correlation between serum Gd-IgA1 and estimated glomerular filtration rate was identified, however, the relationships between Gd-IgA1 levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage and progression to kidney failure were inconsistent. Serum Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with validated prognostic risk factors, but were negatively correlated with kidney function. Further research in larger studies using standardized assays are needed to establish the value of Gd-IgA1 as a prognostic risk factor in IgAN. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40620-023-01874-8.', 'Timing of initiation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy and its impact on cardiovascular outcomes is unknown. The aim was to identify any association between timing of PCSK9i mAb initiation after a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and the rate of subsequent MACE. A retrospective cohort study of adult patients in the United States with a MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) from January 1, 2017 to February 28, 2022 was conducted using administrative claims databases (index date = first observed MACE during this period). Patients were required to have ≥360 days of data visibility prior to (baseline period) and for ≥30 days after the index date (minimum, variable follow up period), and ≥1 prescription claim for PCSK9i mAb therapy on or after the index date. Subsequent MACE rates, time from index MACE to PCSK9i mAb initiation, and time to subsequent MACE were reported. A total of 58,997 patients with ≥1 MACE were identified (mean age = 64 years; 58% male; median follow up=1,241 days). Over half of the patients did not initiate a PCSK9i mAb in the first year after the index MACE. Overall, 35% (n = 20,465) had ≥1 subsequent MACE. Compared to the period between index MACE and prior to PCSK9i mAb initiation, rates of subsequent MACE after PCSK9i mAb initiation were reduced in a time-dependent manner by 70% among patients who initiated PCSK9i mAb therapy within 30 days, 78% (31–90 days), 76% (91–180 days), 65% (181–360 days), and 42% (>360 days) after the index MACE. Those who initiated PCSK9i mAb within 30 days of the index MACE had longer median time to the first subsequent MACE (111 days) compared to patients who initiated at later times. This study provides evidence that earlier initiation of PCSK9i mAb therapy after a MACE appeared to be associated with longer time to a subsequent MACE. Patients without timely treatment are left at an unnecessarily elevated risk of further MACE.']","SGLT2 inhibitors provide cardiovascular benefits by reducing major adverse cardiovascular events and hospitalization for heart failure, effects that appear to be independent of their glucose-lowering action.",4.083570957183838,10,True,,,,,,,,0.5243417769670486,416,0
hyde,How do statins prevent cardiovascular disease?,"Statins prevent cardiovascular disease by lowering cholesterol levels in the blood, specifically LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. By inhibiting an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, statins reduce the production of cholesterol in the liver. This leads to a decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, which in turn reduces the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries (atherosclerosis) and ultimately lowers the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. Additionally, statins have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, further contributing to their cardiovascular protective benefits.","['Lipid droplets (LDs) serve as crucial hubs for lipid trafficking and metabolic regulation through their numerous interactions with various organelles. While the interplay between LDs and the Golgi apparatus has been recognized, their roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the role of Ras-related protein Rab-2A (Rab2A) in mediating LD-Golgi interactions, thereby contributing to very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipidation and secretion in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, our findings identify a selective interaction between Golgi-localized Rab2A and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) protein residing on LDs. This complex facilitates dynamic organelle communication between the Golgi apparatus and LDs, thus contributing to lipid transfer from LDs to the Golgi apparatus for VLDL2 lipidation and secretion. Attenuation of Rab2A activity via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses the Rab2A-HSD17B13 complex formation, impairing LD-Golgi interactions and subsequent VLDL secretion. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Rab2A and HSD17B13 in the liver reduces the serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Collectively, this study provides a new perspective on the interactions between the Golgi apparatus and LDs.', 'The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes.

Collectively, Prdx1 is a negative regulator on osteoclast formation via inhibiting RANKL‐mediated ROS activity, thus suggesting its potential application for treating osteoclast related disorders."", 'Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.', 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition that is characterized by the production of autoantibodies and sustained inflammatory damage.

Despite conventional risk factors, the mechanisms contributing to a higher CHD risk require further investigation, with the immune and inflammatory aspects of SLE playing a significant role. Endothelial cell damage and dysfunction are key factors in the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in SLE patients. This review specifically focuses on endothelial dysfunction and the role of specific microRNAs in the context of SLE and CHD. In addition, we discuss the effects and functions of oxidative stress markers, endothelial progenitor cells, and circulating endothelial cells in individuals with both SLE and CHD. We also explored the typical inflammatory markers associated with SLE and CHD, addressing their clinical significance and limitations.', 'Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a form of severe acute stroke with very high mortality and disability rates. Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.', 'Red radish microgreens (RRM) have gained considerable attention for their promising therapeutic potential.

Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', 'Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a common cardiovascular condition marked by peripheral artery stenosis or occlusion. Despite treatment advancements, patients will still face vascular complications, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Human proteins play crucial roles in biology and drug research. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.', 'Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.', 'Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is serious disease with high morbidity and mortality worldwide.

hyde,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB pathway, which is a key signaling pathway involved in the inflammatory response. This inhibition leads to reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and the subsequent dampening of the inflammatory response.","['Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', 'Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.', ""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials."", 'Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions. In this review, we highlight current findings on the role of ILCs and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma development and pathogenesis. We also examine the underlying mechanisms regulating their function and their interplay with other immune cells. Finally, we explore current therapies targeting these cells and their effector cytokines for asthma management.', 'Long COVID is a debilitating condition that lasts for more than three months post-infection by SARS–CoV–2.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'The Golgi apparatus serves multiple crucial roles in the cell.

Single cell FRAP data revealed two distinct subpopulations with differential SOX9 dynamics, showing varied distribution between healthy and OA hPCs. Moreover, inherently elevated SOX9‐DNA binding was observed in healthy hPCs compared to preserved and OA counterparts. Anabolic factors (BMP7 and GREM1) and catabolic inhibitors (DKK1 and FRZb) were found to modulate SOX9 transcriptional activity in OA‐hPCs. These findings provide valuable insights into the intricate regulation of SOX9 signaling in OA, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for modulating SOX9 activity in diseased states.']","Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by binding to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors that translocate to the nucleus, where they suppress pro-inflammatory gene transcription and induce anti-inflammatory protein expression.",4.147288084030151,10,True,,,,,,,,0.36258475482463837,292,0

Current research on the presence of ARGs in microorganisms focuses mainly on humans, livestock, hospitals, or wastewater. However, the spectrum of ARGs in the dust resistome in workplaces and households has gone relatively unexplored. This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants’ workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.', 'Bacterial resistance to antibiotics remains a significant clinical challenge, contributing to persistently high rates of morbidity and mortality.

Second, mutations in the transcriptional regulator catabolite control protein A (CcpA) significantly promoted cytidine synthesis, increasing the shake flask titer to 2.03\xa0g/L. Finally, after culture in a 5\xa0L fermenter, the cytidine titer reached 7.65\xa0g/L, which was 3.77-fold that of shake flask fermentation. Moreover, a cytidine yield and productivity of 0.06\xa0g/g glucose and 0.16\xa0g/L/h, respectively, were achieved. Subsequently, the regulatory mechanisms through which PyrR and CcpA modification affect cytidine biosynthesis were explored through multi-omics analysis. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that coordinated alterations in carbon, nitrogen, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism were essential to promote cytidine synthesis. However, the increased cytidine production in recombinant strains was attributed to the enhancement of pyrimidine metabolism, the Phosphotransferase (PTS) system, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, and nitrogen metabolism.

This innovative approach offers a cost-effective, equipment-free, and high-throughput solution for bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). By efficiently eliminating rRNA reads and substantially enhancing mRNA detection rates (up to 92%), our method enables precise exploration of bacterial population heterogeneity. Applying RiboD-PETRI to investigate biofilm heterogeneity, distinctive subpopulations marked by unique genes within biofilms were successfully identified. Notably, PdeI, a marker for the cell-surface attachment subpopulation, was observed to elevate cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) levels, promoting persister cell formation.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA and AS patients were treated with UA, and cell viability was measured using the MTS assay and flow cytometry. The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of −5.251 kcal/mol and −6.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients. In the arthritis mouse model, significantly reduced clinical and histological scores were observed in the UA treatment group.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut‐off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio, C‐reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020.

Recent studies have identified numerous novel biomarkers predictive of responses to biologics and small molecule modulators, utilizing a variety of omics approaches in inflammatory bowel disease. In this review, we systematically examine baseline omics biomarkers that predict responses to biological therapies and small molecule drugs, drawing on literature from PubMed. Our analysis spans multiple omics disciplines, including genomics, transcriptomics (both bulk RNA and single‐cell RNA sequencing), proteomics, microbiomics, and metabolomics, with particular emphasis on the impact of models integrating multiple omics datasets. Additionally, to further the field of precision medicine, we evaluated specific biomarkers that may exhibit distinct effects on responses to multiple therapeutic interventions.', 'Promoting neovascularization is a prerequisite for many tissue engineering applications and the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Delivery of a pro‐angiogenic stimulus via acellular materials offers several benefits over biological therapies but has been hampered by interaction of the implanted material with the innate immune response. However, macrophages, a key component of the innate immune response, release a plurality of soluble factors that can be harnessed to stimulate neovascularization and restore blood flow to damaged tissue. This study investigates the ability of biodegradable poly(D,L‐lactic‐co‐glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres to restore tissue perfusion in a hind limb model of ischaemia. Microspheres exhibiting a hierarchical porous structure are associated with an increase in blood flow at day 21 post‐implantation compared with solid microspheres composed of the same polymer. This corresponds with an increase in blood vessel density in the surrounding tissue. In vitro simulation of the foreign body response observed demonstrates M2‐like macrophages incubated with the porous microspheres secreted increased amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) compared with M1‐like macrophages providing a potential mechanism for the increased neovascularization. The results from this study demonstrate implantable biodegradable porous microspheres provide a novel approach for increasing neovascularization that could be exploited for therapeutic applications.', 'The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the development, progression, and metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The TME comprises various cellular and acellular components, including immune cells, stromal cells, cytokines, extracellular matrix, and the oral microbiome, all of which dynamically interact with tumor cells to influence their behavior. Immunosuppression is a key feature of the OSCC TME, with regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contributing to an environment that allows tumor cells to evade immune surveillance and supports angiogenesis. The oral microbiome also plays a pivotal role in OSCC pathogenesis, as dysbiosis, or imbalances in the microbiota, can lead to chronic inflammation, which promotes carcinogenesis through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Due to its relatively short half‐life, lecanemab administered as a bi‐monthly infusion (typically 10\u2009mg/kg) has a relatively brief half‐life. Interaction with abundant plasma proteins binder in the bloodstream can affect pharmacokinetics of drugs, including their half‐life. In this study, we investigated potential plasma protein binding (PPB) interaction to lecanemab using lecanemab biosimilar. Lecanemab biosimilar used in this study was based on publicly available sequences. ELISA and western blotting were used to assess lecanemab biosimilar immunoreactivity in the fractions of human plasma obtained through size exclusion chromatography. The binding of lecanemab biosimilar to candidate plasma binders was confirmed by western blotting, ELISA, and surface plasmon resonance analysis. Using a combination of equilibrium dialysis, ELISA, and western blotting in human plasma, we first describe the presence of likely PPB partners to lecanemab biosimilar and then identify fibrinogen as one of them. Utilizing surface plasmon resonance, we confirmed that lecanemab biosimilar does bind to fibrinogen, although with lower affinity than to monomeric amyloid beta. In the context of lecanemab therapy, these results imply that fibrinogen levels could impact the levels of free antibodies in the bloodstream and that fibrinogen might serve as a reservoir for lecanemab. More broadly, these results indicate that PPB may be an important consideration when clinically utilizing therapeutic antibodies in neurodegenerative disease."", 'Chronic active Epstein-Barr Virus disease is a kind of Epstein-Barr Virus associated T/NK cell lymphoproliferative disease.

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.', 'Tic disorders represent a developmental neuropsychiatric condition whose causes can be attributed to a variety of environmental, neurobiological, and genetic factors. From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In this paper, therefore, we summarize the evidence to date on these abnormalities with the intent to illustrate and clarify the main neuroanatomical differences between patients with tic disorders and healthy individuals.', 'Cognitive impairment, a major determinant of poor functioning in schizophrenia, had limited responses to existing antipsychotic drugs. The limited efficacy could be due to regional differences in the dysregulation of the dopamine system. This study investigated striatal and peripheral dopaminergic makers in schizophrenia and their relationship with cognitive impairment. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated. We evaluated their cognitive performance, examined the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT, and measured plasma levels of dopaminergic precursors (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) that compete with precursors for brain uptake via ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Schizophrenia patients exhibited lower cognitive performance, decreased striatal DAT availability, and reduced levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA. Within the patient group, lower DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen was positively associated with attention deficits. Meanwhile, lower tyrosine levels and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA were positively related to executive dysfunction. Among all participants, DAT availability in the right CN or putamen was positively related to memory function, and plasma phenylalanine level was positively associated with executive function. This study supports the role of dopamine system abnormalities in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The distinct associations between different dopaminergic alterations and specific cognitive domain impairments suggest the potential need for multifaceted treatment approaches to target these impairments.', 'Bright light therapy (BLT) has been proved to have beneficial effects on Parkinson’s disease (PD), the mechanisms remained unclear. Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (Δscales), OCT (Δretinal thickness), PERG (ΔPERG values) and VEP (ΔP100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral ΔN95 latencies for PERG and ΔP100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT. BLT is a valuable and safe non-pharmacological intervention for improving visual function in PD patients. These findings extend neural mechanisms of BLT to visual pathways improvements.

Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\xa0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\xa0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\xa0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\xa0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points.

This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan.

Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378–2.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators—LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI — partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.']",Metformin helps treat type 2 diabetes by reducing glucose production in the liver and increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.,4.222026348114014,10,True,,,,,,,,0.4415906876325607,191,1
hyde,How does SGLT2 inhibition affect kidney function?,"SGLT2 inhibitors, such as the drug mentioned in Document 1, have been shown to have beneficial effects on kidney function. These inhibitors are now being prescribed more frequently to the elderly population in Japan, as mentioned in Document 1. They have expanded indications to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease, leading to an increase in their prescription to patients, particularly the elderly population. This expansion in prescription may be due to the additional benefits these inhibitors provide beyond just glycemic control and weight loss, as mentioned in Document 3. These inhibitors have been associated with cardiovascular and renal protection, as well as slowing down the progression of chronic kidney disease. Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitors can have a positive impact on kidney function by providing additional protection and potentially slowing down the decline in kidney function in patients with various kidney conditions.","['Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020.

This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan.

Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with age and gender, while associations with hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria were inconsistent. In the meta-analyses, a correlation between serum Gd-IgA1 and estimated glomerular filtration rate was identified, however, the relationships between Gd-IgA1 levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage and progression to kidney failure were inconsistent. Serum Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with validated prognostic risk factors, but were negatively correlated with kidney function.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.', 'Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes.

The identification of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD requires a thorough understanding of the metabolic defects involved. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity–response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes.

The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety.

The aim was to identify any association between timing of PCSK9i mAb initiation after a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and the rate of subsequent MACE. A retrospective cohort study of adult patients in the United States with a MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) from January 1, 2017 to February 28, 2022 was conducted using administrative claims databases (index date = first observed MACE during this period). Patients were required to have ≥360 days of data visibility prior to (baseline period) and for ≥30 days after the index date (minimum, variable follow up period), and ≥1 prescription claim for PCSK9i mAb therapy on or after the index date. Subsequent MACE rates, time from index MACE to PCSK9i mAb initiation, and time to subsequent MACE were reported. A total of 58,997 patients with ≥1 MACE were identified (mean age = 64 years; 58% male; median follow up=1,241 days). Over half of the patients did not initiate a PCSK9i mAb in the first year after the index MACE. Overall, 35% (n = 20,465) had ≥1 subsequent MACE. Compared to the period between index MACE and prior to PCSK9i mAb initiation, rates of subsequent MACE after PCSK9i mAb initiation were reduced in a time-dependent manner by 70% among patients who initiated PCSK9i mAb therapy within 30 days, 78% (31–90 days), 76% (91–180 days), 65% (181–360 days), and 42% (>360 days) after the index MACE. Those who initiated PCSK9i mAb within 30 days of the index MACE had longer median time to the first subsequent MACE (111 days) compared to patients who initiated at later times. This study provides evidence that earlier initiation of PCSK9i mAb therapy after a MACE appeared to be associated with longer time to a subsequent MACE. Patients without timely treatment are left at an unnecessarily elevated risk of further MACE.', 'Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and dyslipidemia are both independent predictors of cardiovascular disease, but the association between individual lipid species and subclinical PAD, assessed by ankle-brachial index (ABI), is lacking in large-scale longitudinal studies. We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to repeatedly measure 1,542 lipid species from 1,886 American Indian adults attending 2 clinical examinations (mean ~5 years apart) in the Strong Heart Family Study. We used generalized estimating equation models to identify baseline lipid species associated with change in ABI and the Cox frailty regression to examine whether lipids associated with change in ABI were also associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD). We also examined the longitudinal association between change in lipid species and change in ABI and the cross-sectional association of individual lipids with ABI. All models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, and lipid-lowering medication. Baseline levels of 120 lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, fatty acids, and sphingomyelins, were associated with change in ABI. Among these, higher baseline levels of 3 known lipids (phosphatidylinositol[16:0/20:4], triacylglycerol[48:2], triacylglycerol[55:1]) were associated with a lower risk of CHD (hazard ratios [95% CIs] ranged from 0.67 [0.46–0.99] to 0.76 [0.58–0.99]), while cholesterol was associated with a higher risk of CHD (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.37 [1.00–1.87]). Longitudinal changes in 32 lipids were significantly associated with change in ABI during 5-year follow-up. Plasma levels of glycerophospholipids, triacylglycerols, and glycosylceramides were significantly associated with ABI in the cross-sectional analysis. Altered plasma lipidome is significantly associated with subclinical PAD in American Indians beyond traditional risk factors. If validated, the identified lipid species may serve as novel biomarkers for PAD in this high-risk but understudied population.', 'Metabolic surgery, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), may improve hypertension (HTN) complicated by severe obesity; however, insufficient deliberation exists regarding the therapeutic effect of post-metabolic surgery on HTN. This study aimed to analyze the factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG in patients who have severe obesity, and to create a classification system to predict HTN remission and recurrence. Of the 102 patients who underwent LSG at Iwate Medical University Hospital between 2008 and 2020, 62 were enrolled in this study. Factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG were retrospectively analyzed. The HTN remission rate 12-months post-LSG was 40.3%. The remission cohort had a lower number of preoperative antihypertensive drugs (ADs) than that of the non-remission cohort (one and two tablets, respectively; p< 0.001). Additionally, the remission cohort had a statistically significantly smaller visceral fat area (VFA) than that of the non-remission cohort, at all time points. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were independent predictors of remission. The HTN recurrence rate 36-months post-LSG was 36.0%. In the recurrence cohort, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were higher and larger than that in the non-recurrence cohort, respectively. Stratification, based on the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, revealed that the HTN remission and recurrence rates in the sub-cohort with a small number of preoperative ADs and small VFA (100% and 16.7%, respectively) were better than those in the sub-cohort with a large number of preoperative ADs and large VFA (5.3% and 100%, respectively). In Japanese patients with severe obesity, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG. Stratification, by combining the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, may be useful in predicting HTN remission and recurrence.', 'Lifestyle intervention prevents or delays type 2 diabetes (T2D) in subjects at a high risk of T2D. However, it is not known whether genetic variants modify the effect on incident T2D during lifestyle intervention. To investigate whether a low or high genetic risk has effects on incident T2D in a group-based lifestyle intervention study. The T2D-GENE trial involved 973 men from the Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) cohort, aged 50-75 years, body mass index ≥25 kg/m The intervention significantly lowered the risk of T2D among the participants with a high genetic risk for T2D [hazards ratio (HR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.56,  P P P Our results showed that individuals with a high genetic risk for T2D benefitted from a low-cost group-based intervention focusing on healthy diet and physical activity. Therefore, all individuals at risk of T2D should be encouraged to make lifestyle changes regardless of genetic risk.', 'Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.']","SGLT2 inhibitors provide cardiovascular benefits by reducing major adverse cardiovascular events and hospitalization for heart failure, effects that appear to be independent of their glucose-lowering action.",4.647497892379761,10,True,,,,,,,,0.5243258237838745,473,1
hyde,How do statins prevent cardiovascular disease?,"Statins prevent cardiovascular disease by lowering cholesterol levels in the blood. They work by inhibiting an enzyme in the liver that is responsible for producing cholesterol. By reducing cholesterol levels, statins help to prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to conditions such as atherosclerosis and ultimately cardiovascular disease. This mechanism of action makes statins an effective treatment for reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes.","[""Bone is a dynamic organ which continuously undergoes remodeling throughout one's lifetime. Cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential for regulating bone homeostasis. Osteoclasts, multinucleated giant cells differentiated from macrophage lineage, are responsible for osteolytic bone conditions which are closely linked to ROS signaling pathways. In this study, an anti‐ROS enzyme, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) was found to be expressed both in bone marrow macrophages and osteoclasts. Recombinant Prdx1 protein was found to dose‐dependently inhibit ROS production and osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, Prdx1 protein also attenuated NFATc1 activation as well as the expression of C‐Fos, V‐ATPase‐d2, Cathepsin K, and Integrin αV. Collectively, Prdx1 is a negative regulator on osteoclast formation via inhibiting RANKL‐mediated ROS activity, thus suggesting its potential application for treating osteoclast related disorders."", 'The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.', 'Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a form of severe acute stroke with very high mortality and disability rates. Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.', 'Lipid droplets (LDs) serve as crucial hubs for lipid trafficking and metabolic regulation through their numerous interactions with various organelles. While the interplay between LDs and the Golgi apparatus has been recognized, their roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the role of Ras-related protein Rab-2A (Rab2A) in mediating LD-Golgi interactions, thereby contributing to very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipidation and secretion in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, our findings identify a selective interaction between Golgi-localized Rab2A and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) protein residing on LDs. This complex facilitates dynamic organelle communication between the Golgi apparatus and LDs, thus contributing to lipid transfer from LDs to the Golgi apparatus for VLDL2 lipidation and secretion. Attenuation of Rab2A activity via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses the Rab2A-HSD17B13 complex formation, impairing LD-Golgi interactions and subsequent VLDL secretion. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Rab2A and HSD17B13 in the liver reduces the serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Collectively, this study provides a new perspective on the interactions between the Golgi apparatus and LDs.', 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition that is characterized by the production of autoantibodies and sustained inflammatory damage. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a common complication of SLE, significantly increases CHD-related mortality in SLE patients. Despite conventional risk factors, the mechanisms contributing to a higher CHD risk require further investigation, with the immune and inflammatory aspects of SLE playing a significant role. Endothelial cell damage and dysfunction are key factors in the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in SLE patients. This review specifically focuses on endothelial dysfunction and the role of specific microRNAs in the context of SLE and CHD. In addition, we discuss the effects and functions of oxidative stress markers, endothelial progenitor cells, and circulating endothelial cells in individuals with both SLE and CHD. We also explored the typical inflammatory markers associated with SLE and CHD, addressing their clinical significance and limitations.', 'Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.', 'Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.', 'Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a common cardiovascular condition marked by peripheral artery stenosis or occlusion. Despite treatment advancements, patients will still face vascular complications, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Human proteins play crucial roles in biology and drug research. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.', 'Red radish microgreens (RRM) have gained considerable attention for their promising therapeutic potential.

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases.

The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included “heart failure”, “ccTGA”, “VAD”, “heart transplantation”, and “systemic RV failure”. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data.

They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease.

hyde,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, and by blocking the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This leads to a reduction in the inflammatory response and the subsequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.","['Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', 'Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions. In this review, we highlight current findings on the role of ILCs and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma development and pathogenesis. We also examine the underlying mechanisms regulating their function and their interplay with other immune cells. Finally, we explore current therapies targeting these cells and their effector cytokines for asthma management.', 'Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.', ""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials."", 'Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Adipose tissue inflammation is now considered to be a key process underlying metabolic diseases in obese individuals.

This study focuses on elucidating SOX9 signaling in OA pathology using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) to assess SOX9 activity directly in live human primary chondrocytes (hPCs). Single cell FRAP data revealed two distinct subpopulations with differential SOX9 dynamics, showing varied distribution between healthy and OA hPCs. Moreover, inherently elevated SOX9‐DNA binding was observed in healthy hPCs compared to preserved and OA counterparts. Anabolic factors (BMP7 and GREM1) and catabolic inhibitors (DKK1 and FRZb) were found to modulate SOX9 transcriptional activity in OA‐hPCs. These findings provide valuable insights into the intricate regulation of SOX9 signaling in OA, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for modulating SOX9 activity in diseased states.', 'Long COVID is a debilitating condition that lasts for more than three months post-infection by SARS–CoV–2.

Current research on the presence of ARGs in microorganisms focuses mainly on humans, livestock, hospitals, or wastewater. However, the spectrum of ARGs in the dust resistome in workplaces and households has gone relatively unexplored. This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants’ workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa in vivo', 'The modification of single or multiple genes via metabolic engineering can lead to the dysregulation of central metabolism and affect bacterial growth and metabolite accumulation. Meanwhile, transcription factor engineering can trigger metabolic network reprogramming at the global or systemic level, redirecting metabolic flux toward the synthetic pathways of target metabolites. In this study, we modulated pyrimidine and carbon-nitrogen metabolism in  Bacillus subtilis First, cytidine synthesis was enhanced by knocking out the transcriptional regulator PyrR, which increased the cytidine titer during shake flask fermentation to 0.67\xa0g/L. Second, mutations in the transcriptional regulator catabolite control protein A (CcpA) significantly promoted cytidine synthesis, increasing the shake flask titer to 2.03\xa0g/L. Finally, after culture in a 5\xa0L fermenter, the cytidine titer reached 7.65\xa0g/L, which was 3.77-fold that of shake flask fermentation. Moreover, a cytidine yield and productivity of 0.06\xa0g/g glucose and 0.16\xa0g/L/h, respectively, were achieved. Subsequently, the regulatory mechanisms through which PyrR and CcpA modification affect cytidine biosynthesis were explored through multi-omics analysis. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that coordinated alterations in carbon, nitrogen, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism were essential to promote cytidine synthesis. However, the increased cytidine production in recombinant strains was attributed to the enhancement of pyrimidine metabolism, the Phosphotransferase (PTS) system, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, and nitrogen metabolism. These results indicate that PyrR knockdown can enhance pyrimidine metabolic pathway and promote cytidine synthesis.

The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of −5.251 kcal/mol and −6.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut‐off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio, C‐reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020.

The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut‐off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut‐off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut‐off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L).

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.', 'Cognitive impairment, a major determinant of poor functioning in schizophrenia, had limited responses to existing antipsychotic drugs. The limited efficacy could be due to regional differences in the dysregulation of the dopamine system. This study investigated striatal and peripheral dopaminergic makers in schizophrenia and their relationship with cognitive impairment. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated. We evaluated their cognitive performance, examined the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT, and measured plasma levels of dopaminergic precursors (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) that compete with precursors for brain uptake via ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Schizophrenia patients exhibited lower cognitive performance, decreased striatal DAT availability, and reduced levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA. Within the patient group, lower DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen was positively associated with attention deficits. Meanwhile, lower tyrosine levels and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA were positively related to executive dysfunction. Among all participants, DAT availability in the right CN or putamen was positively related to memory function, and plasma phenylalanine level was positively associated with executive function. This study supports the role of dopamine system abnormalities in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The distinct associations between different dopaminergic alterations and specific cognitive domain impairments suggest the potential need for multifaceted treatment approaches to target these impairments.', 'Bright light therapy (BLT) has been proved to have beneficial effects on Parkinson’s disease (PD), the mechanisms remained unclear. Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (Δscales), OCT (Δretinal thickness), PERG (ΔPERG values) and VEP (ΔP100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral ΔN95 latencies for PERG and ΔP100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT. BLT is a valuable and safe non-pharmacological intervention for improving visual function in PD patients. These findings extend neural mechanisms of BLT to visual pathways improvements.

Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\xa0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\xa0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\xa0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\xa0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points.

Currently, there are no definitive treatments for the cognitive dysfunction associated with vascular dementia. However, early detection and preventive measures have proven effective in reducing the risk of onset and improving patient prognosis. Nitric oxide plays an integral role in various physiological and pathological processes within the central nervous system. In recent years, nitric oxide has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and has emerged as a crucial factor in the pathophysiology of vascular dementia. At different stages of vascular dementia, nitric oxide levels and bioavailability undergo dynamic alterations, with a marked reduction in the later stages, which significantly contributes to the cognitive deficits associated with the disease. This review provides a comprehensive review of the emerging role of nitric oxide in the physiological and pathological processes underlying vascular dementia, focusing on its effects on synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and blood‒brain barrier integrity. Furthermore, we suggest that targeting the nitric oxide soluble guanylate cyclase-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway through specific therapeutic strategies may offer a novel approach for treating vascular dementia, potentially improving both cognitive function and patient prognosis. The review contributes to a better understanding of the multifaceted role of nitric oxide in vascular dementia and to offering insights into future therapeutic interventions.', ""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.""]","Levodopa treats Parkinson's disease by crossing the blood-brain barrier and being converted to dopamine in the brain, helping to replenish depleted dopamine levels in the striatum and compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.",6.1600329875946045,10,True,,,,,,,,0.45339391231536863,415,1

The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world.

One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging.

This study was conducted to assess the levels of adipokines among patients with PCOS with and without MetS and to establish the role of adipokines as an early predictor for the development of MetS in PCOS. Materials and methods In this monocentric, tertiary hospital-based study, 144 patients with PCOS were selected and classified according to Rotterdam criteria and screened for MetS. Patients were grouped into MetS and non-MetS categories based on the presence of MetS. Adipokine levels (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin) were measured and compared, along with other biochemical and anthropological parameters. Data were analyzed using Jamovi statistical software, version 2.3 (Retrieved from  https://www.jamovi.org Results Out of the 144 patients included in the study, 58 were diagnosed with MetS and grouped as MetS. The prevalence of MetS was maximum among the non-PCO\xa0(O+HA) phenotype\xa0(53 out of 58). Significant differences\xa0(p<0.001) in adipokines were observed between the MetS and non-MetS groups. Adiponectin, leptin, and resistin were found to have a significant role as predictors of MetS at an early stage of development of the syndrome, along with other common predictors. However, in later stages, fasting, blood glucose, waist circumference, and triglycerides remain significant predictors. Conclusion The present study reports a high prevalence of MetS among PCOS cases (40.27%). Altered adipokine levels may be significantly associated with the early stages of MetS development and\xa0may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the management of MetS in PCOS. Therefore, the measurement of adipokines during preliminary investigations may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the\xa0management of MetS in PCOS.', ""We report the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy with a history of recurrent and severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy with an uncommon clinical presentation.

Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.', 'Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity–response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.', 'Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes.

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education."", 'The Golgi apparatus serves multiple crucial roles in the cell.

Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.', 'Timing of initiation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy and its impact on cardiovascular outcomes is unknown. The aim was to identify any association between timing of PCSK9i mAb initiation after a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and the rate of subsequent MACE. A retrospective cohort study of adult patients in the United States with a MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) from January 1, 2017 to February 28, 2022 was conducted using administrative claims databases (index date = first observed MACE during this period). Patients were required to have ≥360 days of data visibility prior to (baseline period) and for ≥30 days after the index date (minimum, variable follow up period), and ≥1 prescription claim for PCSK9i mAb therapy on or after the index date. Subsequent MACE rates, time from index MACE to PCSK9i mAb initiation, and time to subsequent MACE were reported. A total of 58,997 patients with ≥1 MACE were identified (mean age = 64 years; 58% male; median follow up=1,241 days). Over half of the patients did not initiate a PCSK9i mAb in the first year after the index MACE. Overall, 35% (n = 20,465) had ≥1 subsequent MACE. Compared to the period between index MACE and prior to PCSK9i mAb initiation, rates of subsequent MACE after PCSK9i mAb initiation were reduced in a time-dependent manner by 70% among patients who initiated PCSK9i mAb therapy within 30 days, 78% (31–90 days), 76% (91–180 days), 65% (181–360 days), and 42% (>360 days) after the index MACE. Those who initiated PCSK9i mAb within 30 days of the index MACE had longer median time to the first subsequent MACE (111 days) compared to patients who initiated at later times. This study provides evidence that earlier initiation of PCSK9i mAb therapy after a MACE appeared to be associated with longer time to a subsequent MACE. Patients without timely treatment are left at an unnecessarily elevated risk of further MACE.', 'Metabolic surgery, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), may improve hypertension (HTN) complicated by severe obesity; however, insufficient deliberation exists regarding the therapeutic effect of post-metabolic surgery on HTN. This study aimed to analyze the factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG in patients who have severe obesity, and to create a classification system to predict HTN remission and recurrence. Of the 102 patients who underwent LSG at Iwate Medical University Hospital between 2008 and 2020, 62 were enrolled in this study. Factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG were retrospectively analyzed. The HTN remission rate 12-months post-LSG was 40.3%. The remission cohort had a lower number of preoperative antihypertensive drugs (ADs) than that of the non-remission cohort (one and two tablets, respectively; p< 0.001). Additionally, the remission cohort had a statistically significantly smaller visceral fat area (VFA) than that of the non-remission cohort, at all time points. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were independent predictors of remission. The HTN recurrence rate 36-months post-LSG was 36.0%. In the recurrence cohort, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were higher and larger than that in the non-recurrence cohort, respectively. Stratification, based on the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, revealed that the HTN remission and recurrence rates in the sub-cohort with a small number of preoperative ADs and small VFA (100% and 16.7%, respectively) were better than those in the sub-cohort with a large number of preoperative ADs and large VFA (5.3% and 100%, respectively). In Japanese patients with severe obesity, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG. Stratification, by combining the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, may be useful in predicting HTN remission and recurrence.', 'The clinical impact of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is still controversial.

Patients with AF on oral anticoagulation (OAC) were categorized according to the presence of NAFLD into 2 groups. The primary outcomes were the 1-year risks of (1) a composite cardiovascular outcome (all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, and pulmonary embolism) and (2) a composite hemorrhagic outcome (intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding).

Sensitivity analyses investigated the risk associated with cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and type of OAC (warfarin vs non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). We identified 22 636 patients with AF-NAFLD (69 ± 12 years, 46.7% females) and 391 014 patients with AF and without liver disease (72 ± 12 years, 42.7% females). NAFLD was associated with a higher risk of composite cardiovascular (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.47-1.61) and hemorrhagic (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.42-1.72) outcomes. This was consistent also for all the single outcomes. Cirrhotic and thrombocytopenic patients with AF-NAFLD showed the highest risks. Compared to patients with AF-NAFLD on NOACs, those on warfarin were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular and hemorrhagic outcomes. In patients with AF, NAFLD is associated with a higher 1-year risk of adverse events, with the risk of adverse events progressively increasing from noncirrhotic to cirrhotic and from nonthrombocytopenic to thrombocytopenic patients. NOACs were associated with a better effectiveness and safety profile compared to warfarin.', 'Lifestyle intervention prevents or delays type 2 diabetes (T2D) in subjects at a high risk of T2D.

Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.']","SGLT2 inhibitors provide cardiovascular benefits by reducing major adverse cardiovascular events and hospitalization for heart failure, effects that appear to be independent of their glucose-lowering action.",8.315428018569946,10,True,,,,,,,,0.5249951690435409,278,2
hyde,How do statins prevent cardiovascular disease?,"Statins prevent cardiovascular disease by reducing the levels of cholesterol in the blood. High levels of cholesterol can lead to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.', 'The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.', ""Bone is a dynamic organ which continuously undergoes remodeling throughout one's lifetime. Cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential for regulating bone homeostasis. Osteoclasts, multinucleated giant cells differentiated from macrophage lineage, are responsible for osteolytic bone conditions which are closely linked to ROS signaling pathways. In this study, an anti‐ROS enzyme, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) was found to be expressed both in bone marrow macrophages and osteoclasts. Recombinant Prdx1 protein was found to dose‐dependently inhibit ROS production and osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, Prdx1 protein also attenuated NFATc1 activation as well as the expression of C‐Fos, V‐ATPase‐d2, Cathepsin K, and Integrin αV. Collectively, Prdx1 is a negative regulator on osteoclast formation via inhibiting RANKL‐mediated ROS activity, thus suggesting its potential application for treating osteoclast related disorders."", 'Lipid droplets (LDs) serve as crucial hubs for lipid trafficking and metabolic regulation through their numerous interactions with various organelles. While the interplay between LDs and the Golgi apparatus has been recognized, their roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the role of Ras-related protein Rab-2A (Rab2A) in mediating LD-Golgi interactions, thereby contributing to very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipidation and secretion in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, our findings identify a selective interaction between Golgi-localized Rab2A and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) protein residing on LDs. This complex facilitates dynamic organelle communication between the Golgi apparatus and LDs, thus contributing to lipid transfer from LDs to the Golgi apparatus for VLDL2 lipidation and secretion. Attenuation of Rab2A activity via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses the Rab2A-HSD17B13 complex formation, impairing LD-Golgi interactions and subsequent VLDL secretion. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Rab2A and HSD17B13 in the liver reduces the serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Collectively, this study provides a new perspective on the interactions between the Golgi apparatus and LDs.', 'Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a common cardiovascular condition marked by peripheral artery stenosis or occlusion. Despite treatment advancements, patients will still face vascular complications, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Human proteins play crucial roles in biology and drug research. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.', 'Myocardial infarction (MI) is a complex disease caused by both lifestyle and genetic factors. This study aims to investigate the predictive value of genetic risk, in addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, for recurrent events following early-onset MI. The Italian Genetic Study of Early-Onset Myocardial Infarction is a cohort study enrolling patients with MI before 45 years. Monogenic variants causing familial hypercholesterolemia were identified, and a coronary artery disease polygenic score (PGS) was calculated. Ten-fold cross-validated Cox proportional hazards models were fitted sequentially including all clinical variables, the PGS, and monogenic variants on the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, recurrent MI, stroke, or revascularization. During a 19.9-year follow-up, 847 (50.7%) patients experienced recurrent events.

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.', 'Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.', 'The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes.

The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included “heart failure”, “ccTGA”, “VAD”, “heart transplantation”, and “systemic RV failure”. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data.

hyde,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and cytokines, reducing the production of inflammatory mediators, and inhibiting the activity of immune cells involved in the inflammatory response. They act by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, which then translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression. This leads to the suppression of inflammatory pathways, such as the NF-κB signaling pathway, and ultimately reduces inflammation in the body.","['Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', ""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials."", 'Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.', 'Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment.

Cytokine levels in PICF or GCF of the same individual were compared using the paired t-test, and those from titanium or gold-casting (UCLA) abutment were compared using the independent t-test. Human gingival fibroblast responses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and IFNγ expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same individual. However, IL-1β (p = 0.032) and IL-1α (p = 0.030) was statistically significantly higher in PICF than in GCF.

This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants’ workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR.

These molecules, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), Janus kinase (JAK), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-Ig (CTLA4-Ig), play a role in the inflammation and joint damage seen in rheumatoid arthritis. By inhibiting these molecules, biologics can help reduce inflammation, alleviate symptoms, and inhibit joint destruction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","['This study aims to identify factors influencing the alleviation of knee joint symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biologic or target synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs). Among 2321 patients who started b/tsDMARDs between 2010 and 2023, we focused on 295 patients who had knee swelling or tenderness at the initiation of b/tsDMARDs and continued b/tsDMARDs at least 3 months, with recorded knee symptoms 6 months later. Symptom relief after 6 months was 78.2% for interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitors, 68.6% for Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, 65.8% for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and 57.6% for cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-Ig (CTLA4-Ig). The initial use of b/tsDMARDs and the use of IL-6 inhibitors in comparison to CTLA4-Ig emerged as a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms. Among 141 patients who underwent knee radiography at baseline and two years later, the deterioration in knee joint radiographs was 7.7% for IL-6 inhibitors, 6.3% for JAK inhibitors, 21.9% for TNF inhibitors, and 25.9% for CTLA4-Ig.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA and AS patients were treated with UA, and cell viability was measured using the MTS assay and flow cytometry. The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of −5.251 kcal/mol and −6.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients. In the arthritis mouse model, significantly reduced clinical and histological scores were observed in the UA treatment group.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut‐off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio, C‐reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020. We compared preoperative levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C‐reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) between patients who suffered acute infection or not within 90\u2009days after surgery. The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut‐off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut‐off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut‐off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L). The neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%. The preoperative NLR shows some ability to predict acute infection after total joint arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently the only method that can cure this disease. In recent years, immunotherapy has developed rapidly and is widely used in the treatment of various hematological malignancies; various immunotherapy drugs, including PD-1 inhibitors, have also demonstrated their safety and efficacy in CAEBV, while immune cell therapies such as Epstein- Barr virus-specific T cells have also displayed their unique advantages in CAEBV.', 'Promoting neovascularization is a prerequisite for many tissue engineering applications and the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Delivery of a pro‐angiogenic stimulus via acellular materials offers several benefits over biological therapies but has been hampered by interaction of the implanted material with the innate immune response. However, macrophages, a key component of the innate immune response, release a plurality of soluble factors that can be harnessed to stimulate neovascularization and restore blood flow to damaged tissue. This study investigates the ability of biodegradable poly(D,L‐lactic‐co‐glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres to restore tissue perfusion in a hind limb model of ischaemia. Microspheres exhibiting a hierarchical porous structure are associated with an increase in blood flow at day 21 post‐implantation compared with solid microspheres composed of the same polymer. This corresponds with an increase in blood vessel density in the surrounding tissue. In vitro simulation of the foreign body response observed demonstrates M2‐like macrophages incubated with the porous microspheres secreted increased amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) compared with M1‐like macrophages providing a potential mechanism for the increased neovascularization.

Due to its relatively short half‐life, lecanemab administered as a bi‐monthly infusion (typically 10\u2009mg/kg) has a relatively brief half‐life. Interaction with abundant plasma proteins binder in the bloodstream can affect pharmacokinetics of drugs, including their half‐life. In this study, we investigated potential plasma protein binding (PPB) interaction to lecanemab using lecanemab biosimilar. Lecanemab biosimilar used in this study was based on publicly available sequences. ELISA and western blotting were used to assess lecanemab biosimilar immunoreactivity in the fractions of human plasma obtained through size exclusion chromatography. The binding of lecanemab biosimilar to candidate plasma binders was confirmed by western blotting, ELISA, and surface plasmon resonance analysis. Using a combination of equilibrium dialysis, ELISA, and western blotting in human plasma, we first describe the presence of likely PPB partners to lecanemab biosimilar and then identify fibrinogen as one of them. Utilizing surface plasmon resonance, we confirmed that lecanemab biosimilar does bind to fibrinogen, although with lower affinity than to monomeric amyloid beta. In the context of lecanemab therapy, these results imply that fibrinogen levels could impact the levels of free antibodies in the bloodstream and that fibrinogen might serve as a reservoir for lecanemab. More broadly, these results indicate that PPB may be an important consideration when clinically utilizing therapeutic antibodies in neurodegenerative disease."", 'Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.']","Biologics treat rheumatoid arthritis by targeting specific components of the immune system, such as blocking TNF or IL-6 signaling, or depleting B cells to reduce autoantibody production, thereby interrupting the inflammatory cascade that causes joint damage.",3.6325647830963135,10,True,,,,,,,,0.4141290932893753,535,2

Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30).

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.', 'Cognitive impairment, a major determinant of poor functioning in schizophrenia, had limited responses to existing antipsychotic drugs. The limited efficacy could be due to regional differences in the dysregulation of the dopamine system. This study investigated striatal and peripheral dopaminergic makers in schizophrenia and their relationship with cognitive impairment. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated. We evaluated their cognitive performance, examined the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT, and measured plasma levels of dopaminergic precursors (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) that compete with precursors for brain uptake via ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Schizophrenia patients exhibited lower cognitive performance, decreased striatal DAT availability, and reduced levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA. Within the patient group, lower DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen was positively associated with attention deficits. Meanwhile, lower tyrosine levels and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA were positively related to executive dysfunction. Among all participants, DAT availability in the right CN or putamen was positively related to memory function, and plasma phenylalanine level was positively associated with executive function. This study supports the role of dopamine system abnormalities in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The distinct associations between different dopaminergic alterations and specific cognitive domain impairments suggest the potential need for multifaceted treatment approaches to target these impairments.', 'Tic disorders represent a developmental neuropsychiatric condition whose causes can be attributed to a variety of environmental, neurobiological, and genetic factors. From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In this paper, therefore, we summarize the evidence to date on these abnormalities with the intent to illustrate and clarify the main neuroanatomical differences between patients with tic disorders and healthy individuals.', 'Bright light therapy (BLT) has been proved to have beneficial effects on Parkinson’s disease (PD), the mechanisms remained unclear. Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (Δscales), OCT (Δretinal thickness), PERG (ΔPERG values) and VEP (ΔP100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral ΔN95 latencies for PERG and ΔP100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT. BLT is a valuable and safe non-pharmacological intervention for improving visual function in PD patients. These findings extend neural mechanisms of BLT to visual pathways improvements.

Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\xa0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\xa0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\xa0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\xa0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points.

The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials."", 'Previous studies have shown an association between the thalamocortical dysconnectivity and treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

It is considered a first-line therapy due to its ability to lower glucose production in the liver and improve insulin sensitivity. This helps in controlling blood sugar levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes. 

In addition to metformin, other treatment options for type 2 diabetes include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, insulin therapy, and other oral medications. The management of diabetes, especially in the perioperative setting, requires careful balancing of glucose control to minimize hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. 

It is important to note that individuals with type 2 diabetes may also be on insulin therapy, which can sometimes lead to severe hypoglycemia. In some cases, insulin therapy may be associated with lipodystrophy, which can further complicate the management of diabetes.

Furthermore, newer medications such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dual GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonists are being increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity. These medications have been shown to have beneficial effects beyond just glycemic control.

Overall, metformin plays a significant role in the management of type 2 diabetes by helping to lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity. However, the treatment of type 2 diabetes is complex and may involve a combination of lifestyle changes, medications, and careful monitoring to optimize patient outcomes.","[""Document(page_content='Common treatments for type 2 diabetes include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, oral medications like metformin, and in some cases, insulin therapy.

crag,What is the mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists?,"GLP-1 receptor agonists work by activating the GLP-1 receptor, which is a receptor found on pancreatic beta cells. When activated, these receptors stimulate the release of insulin and inhibit the release of glucagon, leading to decreased blood sugar levels. In addition to their effects on blood sugar control, GLP-1 receptor agonists are also known to have beneficial effects on weight loss and cardiovascular health. 

The documents provided do not directly address the specific mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, based on broader search results and existing knowledge, it is clear that GLP-1 receptor agonists exert their effects by mimicking the action of the endogenous incretin hormone GLP-1.

crag,What are the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors?,"Based on the provided documents, the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors include their expanded indications to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after 2020. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors may have positive effects on cardiovascular health beyond just managing diabetes. However, it is important to note that the specific cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are not explicitly outlined in the documents provided. 

Document 2 mentions bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, as an alternative therapy in the management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients. This drug is said to enhance myocardial microcirculation and reduce adverse events after clinical interventions, which could potentially contribute to improved cardiovascular outcomes in this specific patient population.

Document 4 discusses common treatments for type 2 diabetes, including lifestyle changes, oral medications like metformin, and insulin therapy. Metformin, often the first-line medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes, helps lower glucose production in the liver and improves insulin sensitivity. While not directly related to cardiovascular benefits, managing diabetes effectively can have a positive impact on cardiovascular health overall.

In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks.

crag,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids, a class of steroid hormones that are involved in the regulation of metabolism and immune response, suppress inflammation through various mechanisms. One of the main ways in which glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects is by inhibiting the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These molecules are key mediators of the inflammatory response and play a crucial role in recruiting immune cells to sites of inflammation. By reducing the production of these pro-inflammatory mediators, glucocorticoids help to dampen the overall inflammatory response.

Additionally, glucocorticoids can also inhibit the expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of endothelial cells, which are involved in the recruitment of immune cells to sites of inflammation. By reducing the adhesion of immune cells to the blood vessel walls, glucocorticoids can help to limit the infiltration of inflammatory cells into tissues.

Furthermore, glucocorticoids have been shown to suppress the activation of transcription factors such as NF-kB and AP-1, which are involved in the regulation of genes encoding pro-inflammatory mediators. By inhibiting the activity of these transcription factors, glucocorticoids can prevent the upregulation of genes involved in the inflammatory response.

In conclusion, glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, reducing the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, and suppressing the activity of transcription factors involved in the regulation of inflammatory genes. While the information provided in the documents does not specifically discuss glucocorticoids, the broader search results on inflammation and immune response mechanisms support the known mechanisms by which glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects.","[""Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells.

crag,How do biologics treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Biologics are a type of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that target specific molecules in the immune system that are involved in the inflammatory process. They are a subclass of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and are often used when traditional DMARDs have not been effective in managing RA symptoms. Biologics work by blocking specific proteins, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), or B cells, that play a key role in the inflammatory response in RA.

The first document mentioned in the search results focuses on factors influencing the alleviation of knee joint symptoms in RA patients treated with biologic or target synthetic DMARDs. This suggests that biologics can help reduce symptoms such as knee swelling or tenderness in RA patients.

The second document discusses the use of a natural compound called Usenamine A (UA) in treating RA and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) by targeting TNF. While UA is not a traditional biologic, it shows potential in inhibiting TNF, which is a common target of biologics in RA treatment.

The third document discusses the use of preoperative inflammatory markers to predict postoperative acute infection in RA patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty. While this does not directly address how biologics treat RA, it highlights the importance of managing inflammation in RA patients, which is a key goal of biologic therapy.

The fourth document investigates the potential link between Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection and the risk for RA in adults. While the relationship between HCV and RA is still unclear, it suggests that infections and immune responses may play a role in the development of RA, which is a key consideration in biologic treatment.

The fifth document focuses on the treatment of chronic active Epstein-Barr Virus disease, which is not directly related to RA. However, it highlights the importance of controlling inflammatory responses, anti-tumor proliferation, and immune reconstitution in managing immune-related diseases, including RA.

In conclusion, biologics treat rheumatoid arthritis by targeting specific molecules involved in the inflammatory response, ultimately reducing inflammation and alleviating symptoms in RA patients.

crag,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"The mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease involves its conversion to dopamine in the brain. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a decrease in dopamine levels. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, and when administered, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine by dopa decarboxylase in the brain. This increase in dopamine levels helps to alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.

It is important to note that while levodopa provides symptomatic relief for Parkinson's disease, it does not slow down the progression of the disease itself. Additionally, long-term use of levodopa can lead to motor fluctuations and dyskinesias in some patients.

Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (Δscales), OCT (Δretinal thickness), PERG (ΔPERG values) and VEP (ΔP100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT.

crag,What are the effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes?,"Metformin is a commonly prescribed medication for the management of type 2 diabetes. It is often the first-line treatment due to its ability to lower glucose production in the liver and improve insulin sensitivity. This can help regulate blood sugar levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Metformin is typically used in combination with lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise for optimal management of the condition.

However, it is important to note that the management of type 2 diabetes can be complex, especially in certain situations such as the perioperative setting. In this context, balancing glucose control with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery is crucial. Different diabetic medications, including insulin, may be used in specific situations to achieve this balance.

Additionally, other medications such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1- and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist tirzepatide are being increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity. These medications have shown beneficial effects beyond just glycemic control, indicating their potential in improving overall health outcomes for individuals with type 2 diabetes.

In conclusion, metformin plays a significant role in the management of type 2 diabetes by helping regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity. However, the treatment of type 2 diabetes may involve a combination of medications, lifestyle changes, and careful monitoring to achieve optimal outcomes. Further research and clinical studies may be needed to fully understand the effects of metformin and other medications on type 2 diabetes management.","[""Document(page_content='Common treatments for type 2 diabetes include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, oral medications like metformin, and in some cases, insulin therapy.

This activation leads to an increase in insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, slowing of gastric emptying, and suppression of appetite.

crag,What are the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors?,"Based on the provided documents, there is limited direct information regarding the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors. Document 1 mentions the expansion of indications for SGLT2 inhibitors to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease, suggesting potential benefits for cardiovascular health. However, the document does not provide specific details on the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Document 4 briefly mentions common treatments for type 2 diabetes, including SGLT2 inhibitors as a medication option. It is important to note that SGLT2 inhibitors are primarily used for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, but they have also shown benefits beyond glucose-lowering effects, such as reducing the risk of cardiovascular events and improving heart failure outcomes.

While the information provided is limited, previous research and clinical trials have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors offer cardiovascular benefits, including a reduced risk of cardiovascular events, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular-related mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. These benefits have led to the expanded use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease, as mentioned in Document 1.

In conclusion, based on the available information and previous research, SGLT2 inhibitors have shown significant cardiovascular benefits in addition to their primary role in managing type 2 diabetes. These benefits include reducing the risk of cardiovascular events and improving heart failure outcomes, making SGLT2 inhibitors a valuable treatment option for patients with cardiovascular conditions.","[""Document(page_content='Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020.

crag,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and prostaglandins, as well as by suppressing the activity of immune cells involved in the inflammatory response. Glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm of target cells, leading to the activation of anti-inflammatory genes and the repression of pro-inflammatory genes.

In Document 1, Fucoxanthin is highlighted for its anti-inflammatory properties, which may involve the modulation of inflammatory pathways and the reduction of oxidative stress.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA.

MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect.

crag,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"The mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease is related to its role as a precursor to dopamine. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a decrease in dopamine levels in the brain. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, levodopa is converted to dopamine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. This increase in dopamine levels helps to alleviate the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.

While the information provided in the documents does not directly mention the mechanism of action of levodopa, the broader understanding of Parkinson's disease and the role of dopamine deficiency in its pathophysiology supports the explanation provided above.

crag,What are the effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes?,"Metformin is a commonly used medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is often prescribed as a first-line treatment due to its ability to lower glucose production in the liver and improve insulin sensitivity. This can help to better control blood sugar levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes. 

Document 2 mentions the importance of carefully managing diabetes in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. It highlights the complexity of preoperative care for diabetic patients, emphasizing the need to balance glucose control while minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. This suggests that metformin, as a medication commonly used for diabetes management, may play a role in optimizing outcomes for diabetic patients undergoing surgery.

Document 3 reports a case of a patient with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy experiencing severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy. While this document does not directly discuss the effects of metformin, it does highlight the challenges of managing diabetes and the potential complications that can arise, such as hypoglycemia. This underscores the importance of individualized treatment plans for managing diabetes and its related complications.

Document 4 discusses the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and other incretin-based therapies for the management of type 2 diabetes. These medications are recognized to have beneficial effects beyond glycemic control, suggesting that there are multiple treatment options available for individuals with type 2 diabetes. While metformin is not specifically mentioned in this document, it indicates the evolving landscape of diabetes management and the potential for additional therapeutic options.

Document 5 focuses on lifestyle intervention as a preventive measure for delaying or preventing type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals. It investigates whether genetic variants may modify the effects of lifestyle intervention on incident type 2 diabetes. While this document does not directly discuss metformin, it highlights the importance of personalized approaches to diabetes management based on individual risk factors and genetic predispositions.

In conclusion, metformin is a commonly prescribed medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, with known effects on glucose production and insulin sensitivity. While the information provided in the documents is not comprehensive, it suggests that metformin plays a significant role in diabetes management, particularly as a first-line treatment option.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress.

crag,How do statins prevent cardiovascular disease?,"Statins prevent cardiovascular disease by reducing the levels of cholesterol in the blood. High cholesterol is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, as it can lead to the formation of plaques in the arteries, which can eventually block blood flow to the heart and cause a heart attack or stroke. By inhibiting an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, statins reduce the production of cholesterol in the liver, leading to lower levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.

While the documents provided did not directly address how statins prevent cardiovascular disease, it is well-established in medical literature that statins are effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. Additionally, statins have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may also contribute to their cardiovascular benefits.","[""Document(page_content='Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\'s disease, Parkinson\'s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

crag,What are the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance?,"Based on the available information, the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance involve the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in bacteria. These genes limit the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobials, leading to an increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The presence of ARGs in bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae has been linked to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant strains.

Document 3 suggests that current research on ARGs primarily focuses on humans, livestock, hospitals, and wastewater, but there is limited exploration of the spectrum of ARGs in other environments such as workplaces and households. This indicates that ARGs can be present in various settings, contributing to the overall issue of antibiotic resistance.

Document 4 highlights that bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a significant clinical challenge, leading to high rates of morbidity and mortality. This resistance makes it difficult to achieve treatment success, necessitating the evaluation of new antibiotics and alternative therapies. This suggests that the development of antibiotic resistance is a multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive approach to combat.

Overall, the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance involve the presence of ARGs in bacteria, which limit the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments.

crag,How do biologics treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Biologics treat rheumatoid arthritis by targeting specific molecules in the immune system that are involved in the inflammatory response. These biologic drugs, also known as biological response modifiers, are designed to target proteins such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukins, or other molecules that play a role in the autoimmune response that leads to joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.

Document 1 mentions the use of biologic or target synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) in treating knee joint symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These drugs work by modulating the immune response to reduce inflammation and slow down the progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis.

Document 2 discusses the use of Usenamine A (UA), a natural compound, in treating rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. UA is believed to target the TNF-TNFR2 complex, which is involved in the inflammatory response in rheumatoid arthritis. By inhibiting this complex, UA may help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Document 3 suggests that certain inflammatory markers in the blood, such as NLR, may be predictive of postoperative acute infection after joint replacement surgery in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This indicates that inflammation plays a key role in the disease process, and targeting inflammatory markers with biologic drugs may help in managing rheumatoid arthritis.

Document 4 investigates the potential link between Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection and rheumatoid arthritis. While the results are unclear, it is known that infections can trigger autoimmune responses, leading to conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Biologic drugs that target the immune system may help in managing rheumatic symptoms associated with HCV infection.

Document 5 discusses the treatment of Chronic active Epstein-Barr Virus disease, which is a type of lymphoproliferative disease associated with the Epstein-Barr Virus. While not directly related to rheumatoid arthritis, it highlights the importance of controlling inflammation and immune responses in managing autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.

This includes large, horizontal, and radial tears and even for meniscal cysts, especially in a stable knee. This technique can also be used in revision meniscal suture when failure is no longer an option. Fibrin clot is prepared from sterile peripheral venous blood from the patient. A plastic syringe is used to stir the blood in a sterile glass container. The fibrin clot is then formed and washed rigorously with saline solution. Rolling the fibrin clot which is fixed to the syringe allows to give the fibrillar aspect of the clot. The formed fibrin clot is now solid enough to be manipulated and can be fixed to a vicryl suture thread allowing it to enter the knee and be fixed inside the meniscal lesion. The clot is wrapped inside the meniscal lesion with inside-out or outside-in suture technique. We used this technique for multiple types of lesions, like bucket handle meniscal tear, horizontal meniscal cleavage, parrot beak tear, and even in lesions within white-white zone. The postoperative protocol is the same as standard inside-out meniscal repair. This technique has been used in the literature with promising results. The fibrin clot–augmented meniscal repair is a demanding but promising technique. We need further follow-up to confirm its effectiveness.

crag,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"Levodopa is a medication commonly used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The mechanism of action of levodopa involves its conversion into dopamine in the brain. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a decrease in dopamine levels. Levodopa, as a precursor to dopamine, is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain where it is converted into dopamine by dopa decarboxylase.

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in controlling movement and coordination. By increasing dopamine levels in the brain, levodopa helps to alleviate the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However, levodopa does not slow down the progression of the disease or prevent the loss of dopaminergic neurons.

It is important to note that levodopa is often used in combination with carbidopa, which is a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor. Carbidopa helps to prevent the conversion of levodopa into dopamine outside of the brain, allowing more levodopa to reach the brain and be converted into dopamine where it is needed.

In conclusion, the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease involves its conversion into dopamine in the brain, thereby increasing dopamine levels and improving motor symptoms. However, levodopa does not address the underlying cause of the disease, which is the loss of dopaminergic neurons.","[""Document(page_content='Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.35597899556159973, 'retrieval_method': 'colbert_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC11649434')"", ""Document(page_content='Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases.

We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting.

MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells.

The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin.

Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (Δscales), OCT (Δretinal thickness), PERG (ΔPERG values) and VEP (ΔP100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT.

HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF.

In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.42549756169319153, 'retrieval_method': 'colbert_vector_similarity'}, id='PMC1748704565')"", 'Document(page_content=""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells.

MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells.

Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress.

This review dissects and critiques the link between COVID‐19 and VSMCs, with particular attention to pathways involving cholesterol, calcium, and phosphate. These pathways underpin the interaction between the virus and VSMCs.

They also inhibit the activation of transcription factors, such as NF-κB and AP-1, which are crucial for the production of inflammatory mediators. Additionally, glucocorticoids can induce the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins, such as lipocortin-1, which inhibits phospholipase A2 and the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Overall, glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects by modulating gene expression and signaling pathways involved in the inflammatory response.","[""Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', metadata={'title': 'The Regulation of the NF-κB p65 and Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathways by Fucoxanthin in Human THP-1 Monocyte Macrophages Under a Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation Model', 'similarity_score': 0.4254975914955139, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC1748704565')"", 'Document(page_content=""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators—LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI — partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM.

Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety.

We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included “heart failure”, “ccTGA”, “VAD”, “heart transplantation”, and “systemic RV failure”. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions.

The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells.

The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects.

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education."", 'Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1- and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist tirzepatide (referred to here collectively as “GLP-1-based therapy”) are incretin-based therapies being used increasingly in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378–2.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators—LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI — partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.', 'Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.', 'In recent years, advancements in immunosuppressive medications and post-transplant management have led to a significant decrease in acute rejection rates in renal allografts and consequent improvement in short-term graft survival.

They have been shown to reduce emergency response time, improve cardiac function indicators, lower the risks of cardiovascular events, and mitigate the occurrence of recurrent myocardial infarctions. Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors have been found to enhance myocardial microcirculation and reduce bleeding complications, making them a safe and effective anticoagulation agent for cardiovascular conditions in elderly patients.","['Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020.

This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022.

Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes.

Although the association between COVID‐19 and VSMCs is recognized, the precise mechanism underlying SARS‐CoV‐2's influence on VSMC phenotype remains largely under‐reviewed. In this context, while there is a consistent body of literature dissecting the effect of COVID‐19 on the cardiovascular system, few reports delve into the potential role of VSMC switching in the pathophysiology associated with COVID‐19 and the molecular mechanisms involved therein. This review dissects and critiques the link between COVID‐19 and VSMCs, with particular attention to pathways involving cholesterol, calcium, and phosphate. These pathways underpin the interaction between the virus and VSMCs.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers.

At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01).

This helps reduce the build-up of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to atherosclerosis and ultimately cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes. Statins also have anti-inflammatory effects and can improve the function of the endothelium, the inner lining of blood vessels, further reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Additionally, statins have been shown to stabilize plaque in the arteries, making them less likely to rupture and cause a heart attack.

We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to repeatedly measure 1,542 lipid species from 1,886 American Indian adults attending 2 clinical examinations (mean ~5 years apart) in the Strong Heart Family Study. We used generalized estimating equation models to identify baseline lipid species associated with change in ABI and the Cox frailty regression to examine whether lipids associated with change in ABI were also associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD).

This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development.

The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included “heart failure”, “ccTGA”, “VAD”, “heart transplantation”, and “systemic RV failure”. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data.

The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis.

hybrid_ifind,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the activity of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and enzymes involved in the inflammatory response. They do this by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm of target cells, leading to the activation of anti-inflammatory genes and the suppression of pro-inflammatory genes. Additionally, glucocorticoids can also inhibit the activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB, which play a crucial role in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. By modulating these pathways, glucocorticoids help to reduce inflammation and its associated symptoms.","['Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', ""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials."", 'Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.', 'Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions. In this review, we highlight current findings on the role of ILCs and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma development and pathogenesis. We also examine the underlying mechanisms regulating their function and their interplay with other immune cells. Finally, we explore current therapies targeting these cells and their effector cytokines for asthma management.', 'Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.', 'Adipose tissue inflammation is now considered to be a key process underlying metabolic diseases in obese individuals.

Cytokine levels in PICF or GCF of the same individual were compared using the paired t-test, and those from titanium or gold-casting (UCLA) abutment were compared using the independent t-test. Human gingival fibroblast responses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and IFNγ expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same individual. However, IL-1β (p = 0.032) and IL-1α (p = 0.030) was statistically significantly higher in PICF than in GCF. IL-8 level was statistically significantly higher with gold-casting than with titanium abutments (p = 0.003). PICF statistically significantly stimulated higher expression of RANKL, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF), while focal adhesion kinase (FAK) suppressed mRNA. The inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1α and IL-1β, are higher in healthy peri-implant tissues. Abutment materials may also influence the level of inflammatory cytokines in PICF.

However, the spectrum of ARGs in the dust resistome in workplaces and households has gone relatively unexplored. This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants’ workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.', 'Bacterial resistance to antibiotics remains a significant clinical challenge, contributing to persistently high rates of morbidity and mortality.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA and AS patients were treated with UA, and cell viability was measured using the MTS assay and flow cytometry. The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of −5.251 kcal/mol and −6.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients. In the arthritis mouse model, significantly reduced clinical and histological scores were observed in the UA treatment group.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut‐off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio, C‐reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020. We compared preoperative levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C‐reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) between patients who suffered acute infection or not within 90\u2009days after surgery. The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut‐off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut‐off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut‐off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L). The neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%.

To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.', 'Tic disorders represent a developmental neuropsychiatric condition whose causes can be attributed to a variety of environmental, neurobiological, and genetic factors. From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In this paper, therefore, we summarize the evidence to date on these abnormalities with the intent to illustrate and clarify the main neuroanatomical differences between patients with tic disorders and healthy individuals.', 'Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting the peripheral and central nervous system and is caused by bi-allelic variants in the  GAN GAN The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00415-024-12744-z.', 'Bright light therapy (BLT) has been proved to have beneficial effects on Parkinson’s disease (PD), the mechanisms remained unclear. Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (Δscales), OCT (Δretinal thickness), PERG (ΔPERG values) and VEP (ΔP100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral ΔN95 latencies for PERG and ΔP100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT. BLT is a valuable and safe non-pharmacological intervention for improving visual function in PD patients. These findings extend neural mechanisms of BLT to visual pathways improvements.

RNA modifications, arising from the epitranscriptome or RNA‐modifying protein mutations, have recently been observed to contribute significantly to neurodegenerative disorders. Specific modifications like N6‐methyladenine (m6A), N1‐methyladenine (m1A), 5‐methylcytosine (m5C), pseudouridine and adenosine‐to‐inosine (A‐to‐I) play key roles, with their regulators serving as crucial therapeutic targets. These epitranscriptomic changes intricately control gene expression, influencing cellular functions and contributing to disease pathology. Dysregulation of RNA metabolism, affecting mRNA processing and noncoding RNA biogenesis, is a central factor in these diseases. This review underscores the complex relationship between RNA modifications and neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing the influence of RNA modification and the epitranscriptome, exploring the function of RNA modification enzymes in neurodegenerative processes, investigating the functional consequences of RNA modifications within neurodegenerative pathways, and evaluating the potential therapeutic advancements derived from assessing the epitranscriptome.', 'Although a role of the thalamus in different arousal and awareness states is well established, there is a surprising lack of knowledge on subregional specificity within this complex, multinucleated structure of the diencephalon.

It helps lower glucose production in the liver and improves insulin sensitivity.,"['Common treatments for type 2 diabetes include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, oral medications like metformin, and in some cases, insulin therapy. Metformin is often the first-line medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It helps lower glucose production in the liver and improves insulin sensitivity.', 'Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent condition that requires careful management in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world. While the key elements are agreed upon, more research and global collaboration are needed to create consistent guidelines and improve patient outcomes.', ""We report the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy with a history of recurrent and severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy with an uncommon clinical presentation. This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education."", 'Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1- and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist tirzepatide (referred to here collectively as “GLP-1-based therapy”) are incretin-based therapies being used increasingly in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.', 'This study analyzes data from the 2009–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to explore the relationship between the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI), also referred to as the pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) among adults in the United States. Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378–2.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators—LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI — partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.', 'Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.', 'In recent years, advancements in immunosuppressive medications and post-transplant management have led to a significant decrease in acute rejection rates in renal allografts and consequent improvement in short-term graft survival.

This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets.

The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included “heart failure”, “ccTGA”, “VAD”, “heart transplantation”, and “systemic RV failure”. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions.

Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.', 'Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.', 'Inhibitors of the interaction between Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A 165 165 2 2 50 50 2 2 50 165 The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00726-024-03411-8.', 'Congenital heart defects occur in approximately 1% of newborns in the US annually.

hybrid_ifind,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB pathway. This pathway is a key signaling pathway involved in the inflammatory response, and glucocorticoids work by blocking the phosphorylation of IκB-α, which in turn prevents the activation of NF-κB. This inhibition leads to a decrease in the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and ultimately reduces the inflammatory response.","['Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', ""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials."", 'Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.', 'Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions. In this review, we highlight current findings on the role of ILCs and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma development and pathogenesis. We also examine the underlying mechanisms regulating their function and their interplay with other immune cells. Finally, we explore current therapies targeting these cells and their effector cytokines for asthma management.', 'Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.', 'Adipose tissue inflammation is now considered to be a key process underlying metabolic diseases in obese individuals.

Cytokine levels in PICF or GCF of the same individual were compared using the paired t-test, and those from titanium or gold-casting (UCLA) abutment were compared using the independent t-test. Human gingival fibroblast responses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and IFNγ expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same individual. However, IL-1β (p = 0.032) and IL-1α (p = 0.030) was statistically significantly higher in PICF than in GCF.

This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants’ workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut‐off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio, C‐reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020. We compared preoperative levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C‐reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) between patients who suffered acute infection or not within 90\u2009days after surgery. The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut‐off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut‐off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut‐off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L).

This includes large, horizontal, and radial tears and even for meniscal cysts, especially in a stable knee. This technique can also be used in revision meniscal suture when failure is no longer an option. Fibrin clot is prepared from sterile peripheral venous blood from the patient. A plastic syringe is used to stir the blood in a sterile glass container. The fibrin clot is then formed and washed rigorously with saline solution. Rolling the fibrin clot which is fixed to the syringe allows to give the fibrillar aspect of the clot. The formed fibrin clot is now solid enough to be manipulated and can be fixed to a vicryl suture thread allowing it to enter the knee and be fixed inside the meniscal lesion. The clot is wrapped inside the meniscal lesion with inside-out or outside-in suture technique. We used this technique for multiple types of lesions, like bucket handle meniscal tear, horizontal meniscal cleavage, parrot beak tear, and even in lesions within white-white zone. The postoperative protocol is the same as standard inside-out meniscal repair. This technique has been used in the literature with promising results.

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL.

The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients.

This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation.

Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques.

Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378–2.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators—LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI — partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.', 'Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences.

In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the amino acid (AA) profiles of patients with pathologically diagnosed PGD, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. The plasma concentrations of asparagine and ornithine were low, and that of aspartic acid was high, in patients with all the pathologic types of PGD, compared to healthy controls. Two distinct diagnostic models were generated using the differential plasma AA profiles using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses, with areas under the curves of 1.000 and accuracies up to 100.0% in patients with MCD and FSGS. In conclusion, the progression of PGD is associated with alterations in AA profiles, The present findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of AAs as a non-invasive, real-time, rapid, and simple biomarker for the diagnosis of various pathologic types of PGD.

The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects.

This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022.

Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included “heart failure”, “ccTGA”, “VAD”, “heart transplantation”, and “systemic RV failure”. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data. Future investigations should focus on identifying surrogate parameters for guiding treatment.', 'Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.', 'Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.', 'Inhibitors of the interaction between Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A 165 165 2 2 50 50 2 2 50 165 The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00726-024-03411-8.', 'Congenital heart defects occur in approximately 1% of newborns in the US annually.

hybrid_ifind,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines, and blocking the activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB.

Additionally, glucocorticoids promote the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins and enzymes, leading to an overall dampening of the inflammatory response.","['Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', ""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials."", 'Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.', 'Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions. In this review, we highlight current findings on the role of ILCs and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma development and pathogenesis. We also examine the underlying mechanisms regulating their function and their interplay with other immune cells. Finally, we explore current therapies targeting these cells and their effector cytokines for asthma management.', 'Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.', 'Adipose tissue inflammation is now considered to be a key process underlying metabolic diseases in obese individuals.

Human gingival fibroblast responses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and IFNγ expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same individual. However, IL-1β (p = 0.032) and IL-1α (p = 0.030) was statistically significantly higher in PICF than in GCF.

A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR.

The neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%. The preoperative NLR shows some ability to predict acute infection after total joint arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Monitoring this ratio, perhaps in conjunction with other markers not analyzed here, may be useful for optimizing the timing of surgery in order to minimize risk of postoperative infection.', 'Patients infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) often present with rheumatic symptoms, but its link to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unclear. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate whether HCV infection is related to the risk for RA in adults. We analyzed data from the 2017–2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). HCV infection and RA status were determined through questionnaires. Covariates included gender, age, race, marital status, body mass index (BMI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and diabetes status. Multivariate logistic regression and subgroup analyses were used to assess the relationship between HCV infection and RA risk. In this population-based study involving 5,825 participants aged 18–80 years (including 485 RA patients), we observed a significantly higher prevalence of HCV infection in the RA group compared with non-RA controls. After adjusting for covariates, multivariate logistic regression showed that HCV infection was associated with an increased risk of RA (OR\u2009=\u20091.93; 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.07–3.50,  p This study demonstrates that HCV infection is associated with the risk of RA in adults, underscoring the potential value of HCV screening in RA patients for improved disease management. However, causal interpretation is limited by the cross-sectional design and reliance on self-reported data.

At present, there is still a lack of standard therapeutic regimen for its treatment, but its basic treatment principles include controlling inflammatory response, anti-tumor proliferation, and immune reconstitution. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently the only method that can cure this disease. In recent years, immunotherapy has developed rapidly and is widely used in the treatment of various hematological malignancies; various immunotherapy drugs, including PD-1 inhibitors, have also demonstrated their safety and efficacy in CAEBV, while immune cell therapies such as Epstein- Barr virus-specific T cells have also displayed their unique advantages in CAEBV.', 'The heterogeneity and suboptimal efficacy of biological treatments and small molecule drugs necessitate their precise selection based on biomarkers that predict therapeutic responses in inflammatory bowel disease. Recent studies have identified numerous novel biomarkers predictive of responses to biologics and small molecule modulators, utilizing a variety of omics approaches in inflammatory bowel disease. In this review, we systematically examine baseline omics biomarkers that predict responses to biological therapies and small molecule drugs, drawing on literature from PubMed. Our analysis spans multiple omics disciplines, including genomics, transcriptomics (both bulk RNA and single‐cell RNA sequencing), proteomics, microbiomics, and metabolomics, with particular emphasis on the impact of models integrating multiple omics datasets. Additionally, to further the field of precision medicine, we evaluated specific biomarkers that may exhibit distinct effects on responses to multiple therapeutic interventions.', 'Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.', 'Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.', 'Antisense oligonucleotides, which are used to silence target genes, are gaining attention as a novel drug discovery modality for proteinopathies.

Multiple techniques have been used to increase meniscal healing, notably biological augmentation techniques. One of them is fibrin clot–augmented meniscal repair, which will be described in this video. This technique is indicated mainly for the lesions with a high failure rate. This includes large, horizontal, and radial tears and even for meniscal cysts, especially in a stable knee. This technique can also be used in revision meniscal suture when failure is no longer an option. Fibrin clot is prepared from sterile peripheral venous blood from the patient. A plastic syringe is used to stir the blood in a sterile glass container. The fibrin clot is then formed and washed rigorously with saline solution. Rolling the fibrin clot which is fixed to the syringe allows to give the fibrillar aspect of the clot. The formed fibrin clot is now solid enough to be manipulated and can be fixed to a vicryl suture thread allowing it to enter the knee and be fixed inside the meniscal lesion. The clot is wrapped inside the meniscal lesion with inside-out or outside-in suture technique. We used this technique for multiple types of lesions, like bucket handle meniscal tear, horizontal meniscal cleavage, parrot beak tear, and even in lesions within white-white zone. The postoperative protocol is the same as standard inside-out meniscal repair. This technique has been used in the literature with promising results. The fibrin clot–augmented meniscal repair is a demanding but promising technique. We need further follow-up to confirm its effectiveness.

hybrid_ifind,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"Levodopa works by being converted into dopamine in the brain, replacing the dopamine that is lost due to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. This helps to improve motor symptoms and function in patients with Parkinson's disease.","['Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\xa0mg) three times daily for 3\xa0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\xa0mg) three times daily and 500\xa0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group). Patients were assessed via Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The serum concentrations of toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4), α-synuclein, brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) were measured before and after treatment.

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.', 'Tic disorders represent a developmental neuropsychiatric condition whose causes can be attributed to a variety of environmental, neurobiological, and genetic factors. From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In this paper, therefore, we summarize the evidence to date on these abnormalities with the intent to illustrate and clarify the main neuroanatomical differences between patients with tic disorders and healthy individuals.', 'Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting the peripheral and central nervous system and is caused by bi-allelic variants in the  GAN GAN The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00415-024-12744-z.', 'Bright light therapy (BLT) has been proved to have beneficial effects on Parkinson’s disease (PD), the mechanisms remained unclear. Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (Δscales), OCT (Δretinal thickness), PERG (ΔPERG values) and VEP (ΔP100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral ΔN95 latencies for PERG and ΔP100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT. BLT is a valuable and safe non-pharmacological intervention for improving visual function in PD patients. These findings extend neural mechanisms of BLT to visual pathways improvements.

RNA modifications, arising from the epitranscriptome or RNA‐modifying protein mutations, have recently been observed to contribute significantly to neurodegenerative disorders. Specific modifications like N6‐methyladenine (m6A), N1‐methyladenine (m1A), 5‐methylcytosine (m5C), pseudouridine and adenosine‐to‐inosine (A‐to‐I) play key roles, with their regulators serving as crucial therapeutic targets. These epitranscriptomic changes intricately control gene expression, influencing cellular functions and contributing to disease pathology. Dysregulation of RNA metabolism, affecting mRNA processing and noncoding RNA biogenesis, is a central factor in these diseases. This review underscores the complex relationship between RNA modifications and neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing the influence of RNA modification and the epitranscriptome, exploring the function of RNA modification enzymes in neurodegenerative processes, investigating the functional consequences of RNA modifications within neurodegenerative pathways, and evaluating the potential therapeutic advancements derived from assessing the epitranscriptome.', 'Although a role of the thalamus in different arousal and awareness states is well established, there is a surprising lack of knowledge on subregional specificity within this complex, multinucleated structure of the diencephalon.
