basic,What are the effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes?,"Metformin is a commonly used medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is often prescribed as a first-line medication for T2DM due to its effectiveness in lowering glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity. Document 1 mentions that metformin helps lower glucose production in the liver and improves insulin sensitivity, which are key factors in managing T2DM.

In Document 3, a case study reports a patient with T2DM on insulin therapy experiencing severe and recurrent hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy. The patient was switched to insulin analogs and educated on correct injection techniques. This indicates that metformin, as a medication commonly used in T2DM management, may have advantages over insulin therapy, especially in preventing hypoglycemic events.

Document 9 discusses the potential neuroprotective role of metformin in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). The study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in PD patients. Although the study did not find significant differences in motor symptoms between the metformin and control groups, trends in biomarker changes suggested a potential impact of adjunctive metformin use on the underlying pathophysiology of PD. This implies that metformin may have beneficial effects on neurodegenerative conditions, which could extend to its effects on T2DM.

Overall, based on the context documents, metformin's effects on type 2 diabetes include lowering glucose production in the liver, improving insulin sensitivity, potentially reducing hypoglycemic events compared to insulin therapy, and showing potential neuroprotective effects in related conditions. However, more specific details on the direct impact of metformin on T2DM, such as its exact mechanism of action and long-term effects, would require further research and clinical studies.","[""Document(page_content='Common treatments for type 2 diabetes include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, oral medications like metformin, and in some cases, insulin therapy.

basic,How does SGLT2 inhibition affect kidney function?,"The context documents provide information on different aspects of kidney function and related conditions, but there is limited direct information on how SGLT2 inhibition affects kidney function specifically. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that SGLT2 inhibitors have been associated with expanded indications for heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020, as mentioned in Document 1. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors may have a positive impact on kidney function in patients with these conditions.

Additionally, Document 6 discusses the use of biomarkers, including amino acid profiles, for the diagnosis of primary glomerular diseases (PGD), which are a leading cause of chronic kidney disease. The study found alterations in amino acid profiles associated with the progression of PGD, indicating a potential link between metabolic defects and kidney function. This suggests that interventions targeting these metabolic defects, such as SGLT2 inhibitors, could potentially benefit kidney function in patients with PGD.

Furthermore, Document 7 mentions a study that assessed the association of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria categories with physical performance test outcomes. The results showed that reduced eGFR and higher albuminuria levels were associated with worse physical performance, indicating a potential impact of kidney function on overall physical health. Therefore, interventions like SGLT2 inhibitors that target kidney function may also have broader implications for overall health and physical performance.

In conclusion, while the direct impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function is not explicitly discussed in the context documents, the information provided suggests that these inhibitors may have a positive effect on kidney function, particularly in conditions such as heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and primary glomerular diseases. Further research and clinical studies may be needed to fully understand the mechanisms and benefits of SGLT2 inhibition on kidney function.","[""Document(page_content='Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020.

To fully answer the question regarding how statins prevent cardiovascular disease, additional information is needed. Statins are a class of medications commonly prescribed to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. They work by inhibiting an enzyme in the liver involved in the production of cholesterol. By reducing cholesterol levels, statins can help prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which is a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.

Statins also have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, which can help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the blood vessels, further contributing to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, statins have been shown to stabilize plaques in the arteries, reducing the risk of plaque rupture and subsequent heart attacks or strokes.

In the treatment of heart failure, ACE inhibitors are recommended as a first-line therapy due to their ability to improve symptoms, reduce hospitalizations, and prolong survival. They are particularly beneficial in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) by reducing the strain on the heart and improving overall cardiac function.

ACE inhibitors are often used in combination with other medications such as beta-blockers and diuretics to provide comprehensive management of heart failure.

The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included “heart failure”, “ccTGA”, “VAD”, “heart transplantation”, and “systemic RV failure”. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions.

In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment.

This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA.

MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect.

basic,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"Levodopa is a key medication used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is a precursor to dopamine and works by increasing dopamine levels in the brain, specifically in areas where dopaminergic neurons have been lost. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating movement and coordination. In Parkinson's disease, the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra leads to a depletion of dopamine, resulting in the motor symptoms characteristic of the disease.

Levodopa is typically combined with carbidopa in a medication known as levodopa/carbidopa. Carbidopa helps prevent the breakdown of levodopa before it reaches the brain, allowing more levodopa to be available to be converted into dopamine. This combination therapy helps alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement.

In the context documents provided, levodopa/carbidopa was used as the standard therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease. The study aimed to evaluate the potential role of metformin as an adjuvant therapy to levodopa/carbidopa in PD patients. While the study did not show significant differences in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores between the metformin group and the control group, trends in biomarker changes suggested a potential impact of adjunctive metformin use on the underlying pathophysiology of PD. Further studies were recommended to assess the effects of metformin on motor symptoms over a longer duration.

In summary, levodopa works by increasing dopamine levels in the brain to alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease caused by dopaminergic neuronal loss. It is often combined with carbidopa to enhance its effectiveness, and additional therapies like metformin are being explored as potential adjuvant treatments to improve the management of Parkinson's disease.","[""Document(page_content='Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators—LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI — partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established.

basic,How does SGLT2 inhibition affect kidney function?,"SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to have a significant impact on kidney function. Document 1 highlights the expansion of indications for SGLT2 inhibitors to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. The study described in Document 1 analyzed the nationwide prescription data of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan and observed a substantial increase in the number of prescribed tablets, particularly in patients aged 75 years and older. The study also noted that the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population has become more common and accounts for a large portion of all prescriptions in Japan. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors are being increasingly used in the elderly population, who are more likely to have kidney-related issues.

Document 2, on the other hand, focuses on IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and its association with chronic kidney disease. While the document does not directly discuss SGLT2 inhibitors, it provides insights into the complexities of kidney diseases and the need for further research to establish prognostic risk factors. This emphasizes the importance of identifying effective treatments, such as SGLT2 inhibitors, that can potentially improve kidney function in patients with conditions like IgAN.

Document 6 delves into the use of amino acid profiles as biomarkers for the diagnosis of primary glomerular diseases (PGD), including minimal change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS). The study found that alterations in amino acid profiles were associated with the progression of PGD and could potentially serve as non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosing various types of PGD. This suggests that interventions like SGLT2 inhibitors that can impact amino acid metabolism may have a positive effect on kidney function in patients with PGD.

In summary, while the context documents provide valuable insights into kidney diseases, the specific impact of SGLT2 inhibition on kidney function is not explicitly detailed. To fully understand how SGLT2 inhibitors affect kidney function, further research studies specifically focusing on the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in different kidney diseases and patient populations would be necessary.","[""Document(page_content='Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020.

Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

basic,What is the role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure?,"The context documents provide information on various aspects of heart conditions, including acute myocardial infarction, chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, and cardiac fibrosis. However, there is no direct mention of ACE inhibitors in the provided context documents. 

ACE inhibitors, also known as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are commonly used in the management of heart failure. These medications work by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, and by reducing the breakdown of bradykinin, a vasodilator. This dual mechanism of action helps to lower blood pressure, decrease the workload on the heart, improve cardiac function, and reduce symptoms of heart failure.

While the documents do not specifically discuss ACE inhibitors, they do mention the use of medications in the treatment of heart conditions, such as CD38 deficiency in myocardial infarction, Zileuton in Chagas cardiomyopathy, and UDCA in cardiac fibrosis. These medications target different pathways involved in heart disease, highlighting the importance of personalized treatment strategies in managing various cardiac conditions.

In conclusion, while the context documents do not directly address the role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure, it is well-established in clinical practice that ACE inhibitors play a crucial role in the management of heart failure by improving cardiac function and reducing symptoms.

basic,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by exerting anti-inflammatory effects through various mechanisms. The context documents provide insights into the role of different pathways and molecules involved in inflammation and potential therapeutic interventions.

Document 1 discusses the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin, a natural carotenoid, which inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators in THP-1 cells by blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. This inhibition of NF-κB pathway is a key mechanism in suppressing inflammation.

Document 4 highlights the anti-inflammatory effects of Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, which reduces inflammatory cytokine release in macrophage cells. MA exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway through the regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation. This interaction with phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) leads to the inactivation of NF-κB signaling and subsequent suppression of inflammation.

While both documents provide insights into the anti-inflammatory effects of certain compounds, the specific role of glucocorticoids in suppressing inflammation is not directly addressed in the provided context. Glucocorticoids are known to exert their anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, such as cytokines and chemokines, and by suppressing the activity of transcription factors involved in inflammation, such as NF-κB. Glucocorticoids also promote the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins, such as lipocortin-1, which inhibits phospholipase A2 and reduces the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

Therefore, while the context documents provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory compounds such as fucoxanthin and MA, additional information specific to the role of glucocorticoids in suppressing inflammation is needed to provide a comprehensive answer to the question.","[""Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells.

basic,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"Levodopa, also known as L-DOPA, is a medication commonly used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is a precursor to dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is deficient in individuals with Parkinson's disease due to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Levodopa is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and is converted into dopamine in the brain, where it helps to replenish the depleted levels of this neurotransmitter.

In the context documents provided, specifically Document 1, levodopa is mentioned as a key component of the treatment regimen for patients with Parkinson's disease. The study described in Document 1 divided patients with PD into two groups, with one group receiving levodopa/carbidopa alone and the other group receiving levodopa/carbidopa along with metformin. The patients were assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) to measure improvement in symptoms. The study did not specifically focus on the mechanism of action of levodopa but rather on the potential benefits of adding metformin as an adjuvant therapy.

Therefore, while the context documents mention the use of levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, they do not provide a detailed explanation of its mechanism of action. Levodopa's mechanism of action involves its conversion into dopamine in the brain, which helps to alleviate the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease.","[""Document(page_content='Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

basic,What are the effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes?,"Metformin is a commonly prescribed medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Document 1 mentions that metformin is often the first-line medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It works by helping to lower glucose production in the liver and improve insulin sensitivity. This indicates that metformin plays a role in reducing blood sugar levels and enhancing the body's response to insulin, which is essential for managing type 2 diabetes.

Document 3 provides a case study where a patient with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy experienced severe hypoglycemia due to improper insulin injection techniques, including reusing needles and not rotating injection sites. The patient was switched to insulin analogs and received education on correct injection techniques, which resulted in improved management of diabetes. This suggests that metformin, being a common medication for type 2 diabetes, may also require proper administration techniques to ensure its effectiveness in controlling blood sugar levels.

Document 9 discusses a study that aimed to investigate the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease. While the study did not show significant differences in UPDRS scores between the metformin and control groups, trends in biomarker changes suggested a potential impact of adjunctive metformin use on the underlying pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.

Document 1 highlights the expansion of indications for SGLT2 inhibitors to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. The study analyzed nationwide prescription data in Japan and found that the number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets increased significantly from fiscal year 2020 to 2022. It was noted that the elderly population, who are more prone to kidney-related issues, accounted for a substantial proportion of SGLT2 inhibitor prescriptions. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors are being increasingly used to manage kidney-related conditions in older individuals.

Additionally, Document 6 discusses the use of amino acid profiles as biomarkers for the diagnosis of primary glomerular diseases, including those affecting kidney function. The study found alterations in amino acid profiles in patients with different types of primary glomerular diseases, indicating a potential link between metabolic defects and kidney conditions. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors may play a role in modulating these metabolic pathways and potentially improving kidney function in patients with glomerular diseases.

Overall, the information provided in the context documents suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors have a positive effect on kidney function, especially in conditions such as chronic kidney disease. However, more specific data on the direct effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function, such as changes in glomerular filtration rate or proteinuria levels, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of their impact on renal health.","[""Document(page_content='Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress.

basic,How do statins prevent cardiovascular disease?,"The context documents do not specifically address how statins prevent cardiovascular disease. The documents primarily focus on topics such as diet, autoimmune conditions, anabolic steroid use, lipid species, and various treatments for cardiovascular conditions. Statins are a class of medications commonly used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. They work by inhibiting an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a key role in the production of cholesterol in the liver. By reducing cholesterol levels, statins can help prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease. Additionally, statins have anti-inflammatory effects and may help stabilize existing plaque, reducing the risk of plaque rupture and subsequent heart attacks or strokes. Further information on the specific mechanisms by which statins prevent cardiovascular disease would be needed to provide a more comprehensive answer.","[""Document(page_content='Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases.

basic,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by modulating the activity of key signaling pathways and immune cells involved in the inflammatory response. Glucocorticoids, such as corticosteroids, are known for their potent anti-inflammatory properties and are commonly used in the treatment of various inflammatory conditions.

From Document 1, we can infer that fucoxanthin, a natural compound, exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. NF-κB is a transcription factor that plays a central role in regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in response to various stimuli, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS). By inhibiting the phosphorylation of IκB-α, fucoxanthin blocks the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, thereby reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α.

Document 4 also provides insights into the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of a natural compound, Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), which inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway. MA acts on phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) and leads to the sustained elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which in turn inactivates the NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). This inhibition of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses by MA highlights the importance of cAMP-PKA axis regulation in suppressing inflammation.

In Document 6, the review discusses the role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma, emphasizing the complex interplay between these immune cells and the regulation of inflammatory responses in the lung. While this document does not directly address glucocorticoids, it provides valuable insights into the intricate mechanisms involved in asthma-related inflammation, which can be modulated by glucocorticoid therapy.

Overall, glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by targeting key signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, and modulating the activity of immune cells involved in the inflammatory response. These mechanisms contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids in various inflammatory conditions.","[""Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', metadata={}, id='2971')"", ""Document(page_content='Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases.

basic,How do biologics treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Biologics are a type of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These drugs target specific proteins in the immune system that play a role in the inflammation process that leads to joint damage in RA. Biologics work by blocking certain cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Janus kinase (JAK), which are involved in the inflammatory response in RA. By targeting these specific proteins, biologics help to reduce inflammation, slow down joint damage, and alleviate symptoms of RA.

In the context documents provided, several studies have highlighted the effectiveness of biologics in treating RA. Document 1 specifically mentions the use of biologic or target synthetic DMARDs in alleviating knee joint symptoms in patients with RA. The study found that the use of IL-6 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, and TNF inhibitors resulted in significant improvement in knee joint symptoms and inhibition of joint destruction compared to other treatments. Document 2 discusses the use of a natural compound called Usenamine A (UA) in targeting the TNF-TNFR2 complex, which is involved in the inflammatory response in RA. UA was shown to suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines in RA patients, indicating its potential as a treatment option.

It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement.

Adipokines are the key molecules that alter the adipose tissue metabolism and distribution, leading to MetS. This study was conducted to assess the levels of adipokines among patients with PCOS with and without MetS and to establish the role of adipokines as an early predictor for the development of MetS in PCOS. Materials and methods In this monocentric, tertiary hospital-based study, 144 patients with PCOS were selected and classified according to Rotterdam criteria and screened for MetS. Patients were grouped into MetS and non-MetS categories based on the presence of MetS. Adipokine levels (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin) were measured and compared, along with other biochemical and anthropological parameters. Data were analyzed using Jamovi statistical software, version 2.3 (Retrieved from  https://www.jamovi.org Results Out of the 144 patients included in the study, 58 were diagnosed with MetS and grouped as MetS. The prevalence of MetS was maximum among the non-PCO\xa0(O+HA) phenotype\xa0(53 out of 58). Significant differences\xa0(p<0.001) in adipokines were observed between the MetS and non-MetS groups. Adiponectin, leptin, and resistin were found to have a significant role as predictors of MetS at an early stage of development of the syndrome, along with other common predictors. However, in later stages, fasting, blood glucose, waist circumference, and triglycerides remain significant predictors. Conclusion The present study reports a high prevalence of MetS among PCOS cases (40.27%). Altered adipokine levels may be significantly associated with the early stages of MetS development and\xa0may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the management of MetS in PCOS. Therefore, the measurement of adipokines during preliminary investigations may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the\xa0management of MetS in PCOS.', 'Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.', 'This study analyzes data from the 2009–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to explore the relationship between the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI), also referred to as the pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) among adults in the United States. Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378–2.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators—LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI — partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.']",Metformin helps treat type 2 diabetes by reducing glucose production in the liver and increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.,7.621567010879517,10,True,,0.7438867502501072,0.8928571428348213,0.5,1.0,,0.488759705237246,0.4509198486804962,422,0

Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity–response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.', 'In hemodialysis (HD), complement activation, bioincompatibility, and inflammation are intricately intertwined. In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.']","SGLT2 inhibitors protect kidney function by reducing hyperfiltration, decreasing albuminuria, and providing nephroprotection through mechanisms independent of glycemic control.",8.634596109390259,10,True,,0.9098681059823756,0.6666666666333333,0.0,0.125,,0.4347300250408709,0.4914761960506439,777,0

They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease. In this review, we summarize the effects of GLP-1 and incretin-based therapeutics on gastric, biliary and small intestinal function.

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques.

Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS.

A retrospective cohort study of adult patients in the United States with a MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) from January 1, 2017 to February 28, 2022 was conducted using administrative claims databases (index date = first observed MACE during this period). Patients were required to have ≥360 days of data visibility prior to (baseline period) and for ≥30 days after the index date (minimum, variable follow up period), and ≥1 prescription claim for PCSK9i mAb therapy on or after the index date. Subsequent MACE rates, time from index MACE to PCSK9i mAb initiation, and time to subsequent MACE were reported. A total of 58,997 patients with ≥1 MACE were identified (mean age = 64 years; 58% male; median follow up=1,241 days). Over half of the patients did not initiate a PCSK9i mAb in the first year after the index MACE. Overall, 35% (n = 20,465) had ≥1 subsequent MACE. Compared to the period between index MACE and prior to PCSK9i mAb initiation, rates of subsequent MACE after PCSK9i mAb initiation were reduced in a time-dependent manner by 70% among patients who initiated PCSK9i mAb therapy within 30 days, 78% (31–90 days), 76% (91–180 days), 65% (181–360 days), and 42% (>360 days) after the index MACE. Those who initiated PCSK9i mAb within 30 days of the index MACE had longer median time to the first subsequent MACE (111 days) compared to patients who initiated at later times. This study provides evidence that earlier initiation of PCSK9i mAb therapy after a MACE appeared to be associated with longer time to a subsequent MACE.

Patients with AF on oral anticoagulation (OAC) were categorized according to the presence of NAFLD into 2 groups. The primary outcomes were the 1-year risks of (1) a composite cardiovascular outcome (all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, and pulmonary embolism) and (2) a composite hemorrhagic outcome (intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01).

Statins inhibit an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a key role in the production of cholesterol in the liver. By reducing cholesterol levels, statins help to prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries, thereby reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Additionally, statins have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which can also contribute to their cardiovascular protective effects.","['Lipid droplets (LDs) serve as crucial hubs for lipid trafficking and metabolic regulation through their numerous interactions with various organelles. While the interplay between LDs and the Golgi apparatus has been recognized, their roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the role of Ras-related protein Rab-2A (Rab2A) in mediating LD-Golgi interactions, thereby contributing to very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipidation and secretion in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, our findings identify a selective interaction between Golgi-localized Rab2A and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) protein residing on LDs. This complex facilitates dynamic organelle communication between the Golgi apparatus and LDs, thus contributing to lipid transfer from LDs to the Golgi apparatus for VLDL2 lipidation and secretion. Attenuation of Rab2A activity via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses the Rab2A-HSD17B13 complex formation, impairing LD-Golgi interactions and subsequent VLDL secretion. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Rab2A and HSD17B13 in the liver reduces the serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels.

In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.', 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition that is characterized by the production of autoantibodies and sustained inflammatory damage. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a common complication of SLE, significantly increases CHD-related mortality in SLE patients. Despite conventional risk factors, the mechanisms contributing to a higher CHD risk require further investigation, with the immune and inflammatory aspects of SLE playing a significant role. Endothelial cell damage and dysfunction are key factors in the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in SLE patients. This review specifically focuses on endothelial dysfunction and the role of specific microRNAs in the context of SLE and CHD. In addition, we discuss the effects and functions of oxidative stress markers, endothelial progenitor cells, and circulating endothelial cells in individuals with both SLE and CHD. We also explored the typical inflammatory markers associated with SLE and CHD, addressing their clinical significance and limitations.', 'The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.', 'Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a form of severe acute stroke with very high mortality and disability rates. Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.', 'Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the gradual accumulation of plaques in arterial walls, with its pathogenesis remaining incompletely understood. Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review summarizes the primary findings of these studies, focusing on the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of action. Based on these insights, we propose future strategies to enhance the efficacy, specificity, and safety of existing natural products and formulae for AS treatment. Additionally, this study offers a perspective for future research that may enhance our understanding of the roles and the mechanisms of CHM-derived phytochemicals and formulae in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and treating AS.', 'Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', 'Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.', 'Red radish microgreens (RRM) have gained considerable attention for their promising therapeutic potential.

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.', 'Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.', 'Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) remains a rare congenital disorder with a wide range of manifestations. The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included “heart failure”, “ccTGA”, “VAD”, “heart transplantation”, and “systemic RV failure”. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity–response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.', 'Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1- and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist tirzepatide (referred to here collectively as “GLP-1-based therapy”) are incretin-based therapies being used increasingly in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity. They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease. In this review, we summarize the effects of GLP-1 and incretin-based therapeutics on gastric, biliary and small intestinal function.

Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions.

The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases.

It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.', 'Dysregulated and excessive inflammatory reactions can lead to tissue damage, which is the underlying cause of most human diseases. Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'The transcription factor SOX9 is integral to tissue homeostasis and is implicated in skeletal malformation, campomelic dysplasia, and osteoarthritis (OA). Despite extensive research, the complete regulatory landscape of SOX9 transcriptional activity, interconnected with signaling pathways (TGFβ, WNT, BMP, IHH, NFκB, and HIF), remains challenging to decipher. This study focuses on elucidating SOX9 signaling in OA pathology using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) to assess SOX9 activity directly in live human primary chondrocytes (hPCs). Single cell FRAP data revealed two distinct subpopulations with differential SOX9 dynamics, showing varied distribution between healthy and OA hPCs. Moreover, inherently elevated SOX9‐DNA binding was observed in healthy hPCs compared to preserved and OA counterparts. Anabolic factors (BMP7 and GREM1) and catabolic inhibitors (DKK1 and FRZb) were found to modulate SOX9 transcriptional activity in OA‐hPCs. These findings provide valuable insights into the intricate regulation of SOX9 signaling in OA, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for modulating SOX9 activity in diseased states.', 'Adipose tissue inflammation is now considered to be a key process underlying metabolic diseases in obese individuals.

The TME comprises various cellular and acellular components, including immune cells, stromal cells, cytokines, extracellular matrix, and the oral microbiome, all of which dynamically interact with tumor cells to influence their behavior. Immunosuppression is a key feature of the OSCC TME, with regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contributing to an environment that allows tumor cells to evade immune surveillance and supports angiogenesis. The oral microbiome also plays a pivotal role in OSCC pathogenesis, as dysbiosis, or imbalances in the microbiota, can lead to chronic inflammation, which promotes carcinogenesis through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS).

hyde,What are the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance?,"The mechanisms of antibiotic resistance include the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in microorganisms, such as those detected in indoor dust samples from workplaces and households. Additionally, bacteria can develop resistance through the production of beta-lactamases, such as AmpC and inducible AmpC beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Other mechanisms include the modification of genes via metabolic engineering, which can lead to dysregulation of central metabolism and affect bacterial growth and metabolite accumulation.","['Bacterial resistance to antibiotics remains a significant clinical challenge, contributing to persistently high rates of morbidity and mortality.

Current research on the presence of ARGs in microorganisms focuses mainly on humans, livestock, hospitals, or wastewater. However, the spectrum of ARGs in the dust resistome in workplaces and households has gone relatively unexplored. This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants’ workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa in vivo', 'Antifungal resistance and tolerance are distinct responses exhibited by fungi when exposed to drugs.

Second, mutations in the transcriptional regulator catabolite control protein A (CcpA) significantly promoted cytidine synthesis, increasing the shake flask titer to 2.03\xa0g/L. Finally, after culture in a 5\xa0L fermenter, the cytidine titer reached 7.65\xa0g/L, which was 3.77-fold that of shake flask fermentation. Moreover, a cytidine yield and productivity of 0.06\xa0g/g glucose and 0.16\xa0g/L/h, respectively, were achieved. Subsequently, the regulatory mechanisms through which PyrR and CcpA modification affect cytidine biosynthesis were explored through multi-omics analysis. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that coordinated alterations in carbon, nitrogen, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism were essential to promote cytidine synthesis. However, the increased cytidine production in recombinant strains was attributed to the enhancement of pyrimidine metabolism, the Phosphotransferase (PTS) system, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, and nitrogen metabolism.

They can inhibit the activity of cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which play a key role in promoting inflammation and joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis. By blocking these inflammatory pathways, biologics can help reduce joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, leading to symptom relief and improved outcomes for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, biologics can also target specific cellular receptors or molecules involved in the inflammatory response, providing a more targeted approach to treating the disease.","['This study aims to identify factors influencing the alleviation of knee joint symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biologic or target synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs). Among 2321 patients who started b/tsDMARDs between 2010 and 2023, we focused on 295 patients who had knee swelling or tenderness at the initiation of b/tsDMARDs and continued b/tsDMARDs at least 3 months, with recorded knee symptoms 6 months later. Symptom relief after 6 months was 78.2% for interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitors, 68.6% for Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, 65.8% for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and 57.6% for cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-Ig (CTLA4-Ig). The initial use of b/tsDMARDs and the use of IL-6 inhibitors in comparison to CTLA4-Ig emerged as a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms. Among 141 patients who underwent knee radiography at baseline and two years later, the deterioration in knee joint radiographs was 7.7% for IL-6 inhibitors, 6.3% for JAK inhibitors, 21.9% for TNF inhibitors, and 25.9% for CTLA4-Ig.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA and AS patients were treated with UA, and cell viability was measured using the MTS assay and flow cytometry. The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of −5.251 kcal/mol and −6.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients. In the arthritis mouse model, significantly reduced clinical and histological scores were observed in the UA treatment group. Our findings suggest that UA has potential as a binding target for TNF, suppresses inflammatory cytokines in PBMCs, and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on arthritis in a mouse model.', 'Preoperative levels of certain inflammatory markers in the blood can predict acute infection after primary total joint arthroplasty in patients without inflammatory disease, but whether they can do so in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut‐off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio, C‐reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020. We compared preoperative levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C‐reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) between patients who suffered acute infection or not within 90\u2009days after surgery. The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut‐off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut‐off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut‐off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L). The neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%. The preoperative NLR shows some ability to predict acute infection after total joint arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Monitoring this ratio, perhaps in conjunction with other markers not analyzed here, may be useful for optimizing the timing of surgery in order to minimize risk of postoperative infection.', 'The heterogeneity and suboptimal efficacy of biological treatments and small molecule drugs necessitate their precise selection based on biomarkers that predict therapeutic responses in inflammatory bowel disease.

Interaction with abundant plasma proteins binder in the bloodstream can affect pharmacokinetics of drugs, including their half‐life. In this study, we investigated potential plasma protein binding (PPB) interaction to lecanemab using lecanemab biosimilar. Lecanemab biosimilar used in this study was based on publicly available sequences. ELISA and western blotting were used to assess lecanemab biosimilar immunoreactivity in the fractions of human plasma obtained through size exclusion chromatography. The binding of lecanemab biosimilar to candidate plasma binders was confirmed by western blotting, ELISA, and surface plasmon resonance analysis. Using a combination of equilibrium dialysis, ELISA, and western blotting in human plasma, we first describe the presence of likely PPB partners to lecanemab biosimilar and then identify fibrinogen as one of them. Utilizing surface plasmon resonance, we confirmed that lecanemab biosimilar does bind to fibrinogen, although with lower affinity than to monomeric amyloid beta. In the context of lecanemab therapy, these results imply that fibrinogen levels could impact the levels of free antibodies in the bloodstream and that fibrinogen might serve as a reservoir for lecanemab. More broadly, these results indicate that PPB may be an important consideration when clinically utilizing therapeutic antibodies in neurodegenerative disease."", 'Human cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is characterized by chronic skin pathology.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases.

One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging.

Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30). Patients in group 1 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\xa0mg) three times daily for 3\xa0months plus placebo (Control group), while those in group 2 received levodopa/carbidopa (250/25\xa0mg) three times daily and 500\xa0mg metformin two times daily (Metformin group).

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.', 'Cognitive impairment, a major determinant of poor functioning in schizophrenia, had limited responses to existing antipsychotic drugs. The limited efficacy could be due to regional differences in the dysregulation of the dopamine system. This study investigated striatal and peripheral dopaminergic makers in schizophrenia and their relationship with cognitive impairment. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated. We evaluated their cognitive performance, examined the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT, and measured plasma levels of dopaminergic precursors (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) that compete with precursors for brain uptake via ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Schizophrenia patients exhibited lower cognitive performance, decreased striatal DAT availability, and reduced levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA. Within the patient group, lower DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen was positively associated with attention deficits. Meanwhile, lower tyrosine levels and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA were positively related to executive dysfunction. Among all participants, DAT availability in the right CN or putamen was positively related to memory function, and plasma phenylalanine level was positively associated with executive function. This study supports the role of dopamine system abnormalities in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The distinct associations between different dopaminergic alterations and specific cognitive domain impairments suggest the potential need for multifaceted treatment approaches to target these impairments.', 'Bright light therapy (BLT) has been proved to have beneficial effects on Parkinson’s disease (PD), the mechanisms remained unclear. Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (Δscales), OCT (Δretinal thickness), PERG (ΔPERG values) and VEP (ΔP100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral ΔN95 latencies for PERG and ΔP100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT. BLT is a valuable and safe non-pharmacological intervention for improving visual function in PD patients. These findings extend neural mechanisms of BLT to visual pathways improvements.

From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In this paper, therefore, we summarize the evidence to date on these abnormalities with the intent to illustrate and clarify the main neuroanatomical differences between patients with tic disorders and healthy individuals.', 'In severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), sedatives are often used to control intracranial pressure (ICP), to reduce brain metabolism, to allow for other treatments such as mechanical ventilation or targeted temperature management, or to control paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\xa0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\xa0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\xa0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\xa0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points. This study is the first prospective RCT to investigate the safety of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in TBI patients.

All participants underwent rs-fMRI before and 3 days after infusion. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) was analyzed in the left/right thalamus. FCs between the bilateral thalamus and right middle frontal cortex (BA46) and between the left thalamus and left anterior paracingulate gyrus (BA8) increased among patients in the ketamine group in clinical trials 1 and 2, respectively. FCs between the right thalamus and bilateral frontal pole (BA9) and between the right thalamus and left rostral paracingulate gyrus (BA10) decreased among patients in the ketamine group in clinical trials 1 and 2, respectively. However, the associations between those FC changes and clinical symptom changes did not survive statistical significance after multiple comparison corrections. Whether ketamine-related changes in thalamocortical connectivity may be associated with ketamine’s antidepressant and antisuicidal effects would need further investigation.

The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials."", ""An increasing body of evidence indicates altered DNA methylation in Parkinson's disease, yet the reproducibility and utility of such methylation changes are largely unexplored.

Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement.

Adipokines are the key molecules that alter the adipose tissue metabolism and distribution, leading to MetS. This study was conducted to assess the levels of adipokines among patients with PCOS with and without MetS and to establish the role of adipokines as an early predictor for the development of MetS in PCOS. Materials and methods In this monocentric, tertiary hospital-based study, 144 patients with PCOS were selected and classified according to Rotterdam criteria and screened for MetS. Patients were grouped into MetS and non-MetS categories based on the presence of MetS. Adipokine levels (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin) were measured and compared, along with other biochemical and anthropological parameters. Data were analyzed using Jamovi statistical software, version 2.3 (Retrieved from  https://www.jamovi.org Results Out of the 144 patients included in the study, 58 were diagnosed with MetS and grouped as MetS. The prevalence of MetS was maximum among the non-PCO\xa0(O+HA) phenotype\xa0(53 out of 58). Significant differences\xa0(p<0.001) in adipokines were observed between the MetS and non-MetS groups. Adiponectin, leptin, and resistin were found to have a significant role as predictors of MetS at an early stage of development of the syndrome, along with other common predictors. However, in later stages, fasting, blood glucose, waist circumference, and triglycerides remain significant predictors. Conclusion The present study reports a high prevalence of MetS among PCOS cases (40.27%). Altered adipokine levels may be significantly associated with the early stages of MetS development and\xa0may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the management of MetS in PCOS. Therefore, the measurement of adipokines during preliminary investigations may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the\xa0management of MetS in PCOS.', 'Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs.

The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function.

Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01).

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.']","SGLT2 inhibitors protect kidney function by reducing hyperfiltration, decreasing albuminuria, and providing nephroprotection through mechanisms independent of glycemic control.",4.892457962036133,10,True,,0.8324172327700121,0.699999999965,0.0,0.2,,0.48984371243414937,0.49966233372688296,547,1

This was the case of a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for the exploration and management of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Her diabetes has been evolving since the age of 40 years and was complicated by minimal retinopathy. She was on premixed human insulin, administered through an insulin syringe for the last 17 years. She presented a history of well-controlled diabetes until five months back when she started to show a fluctuating blood glucose concentration, with episodes of unpredictable hypoglycemia occurring at variable times, with values inferior to 0.3 g/l associated with neurological features. Clinical examination revealed a swelling localized in the hypogastric region of the abdomen. It was painless, firm, not fixed to the underlying plans, without local inflammatory signs, and had appeared in the patient's preferred insulin injection site. Thus, we retained the diagnosis of insulin-induced lipohypertrophy. The patient has reported reusing needles for up to one week for economic reasons, and not frequently rotating insulin injection sites. The patient found a less painful injection in the lipohypertrophic area, and she continued to inject insulin into that zone, leading to its progressive enlargement. Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education."", 'The 2019 American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists guidelines suggested peak GH-cutoffs to glucagon test (GST) of ≤3 and ≤1 µg/L in the diagnosis of permanent GH deficiency (GHD) during the transition phase. The aim of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of GST compared to insulin tolerance test (ITT) in the definition of GHD at adult height achievement. Ninety-seven subjects with childhood-onset GHD (median age, 17.39 years) underwent ITT, GST, and IGF-1 testing; 44 subjects were idiopathic (isolated GHD), 35 moderate organic GHD (0-2 hormone deficiencies) and 18 severe organic GHD (≥3 hormone deficiencies). Bland and Altman analysis showed a high consistency of GH peak measures after ITT and GST. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified 7.3 μg/L as the optimal GH peak cutoff to GST [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.15-8.91; sensitivity 95.7%, specificity 88.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) 88.0%, negative predictive value (NPV) 95.7%] able to correctly classify 91.8% of the entire cohort while 5.8 μg/L was the best GH peak cutoff able to correctly classify 91.4% of moderate organic GHD patients (95% CI 3.16-7.39; sensitivity 96.0%, specificity 80.0%, PPV 92.3%, NPV 88.9%). Patients with ≥3 hormone deficiencies showed a GH peak <5 μg/L at ITT and <5.8 μg/L at GST but 1.

They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease.

The aim was to identify any association between timing of PCSK9i mAb initiation after a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and the rate of subsequent MACE. A retrospective cohort study of adult patients in the United States with a MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) from January 1, 2017 to February 28, 2022 was conducted using administrative claims databases (index date = first observed MACE during this period). Patients were required to have ≥360 days of data visibility prior to (baseline period) and for ≥30 days after the index date (minimum, variable follow up period), and ≥1 prescription claim for PCSK9i mAb therapy on or after the index date. Subsequent MACE rates, time from index MACE to PCSK9i mAb initiation, and time to subsequent MACE were reported. A total of 58,997 patients with ≥1 MACE were identified (mean age = 64 years; 58% male; median follow up=1,241 days). Over half of the patients did not initiate a PCSK9i mAb in the first year after the index MACE. Overall, 35% (n = 20,465) had ≥1 subsequent MACE. Compared to the period between index MACE and prior to PCSK9i mAb initiation, rates of subsequent MACE after PCSK9i mAb initiation were reduced in a time-dependent manner by 70% among patients who initiated PCSK9i mAb therapy within 30 days, 78% (31–90 days), 76% (91–180 days), 65% (181–360 days), and 42% (>360 days) after the index MACE. Those who initiated PCSK9i mAb within 30 days of the index MACE had longer median time to the first subsequent MACE (111 days) compared to patients who initiated at later times. This study provides evidence that earlier initiation of PCSK9i mAb therapy after a MACE appeared to be associated with longer time to a subsequent MACE. Patients without timely treatment are left at an unnecessarily elevated risk of further MACE.', 'The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety.

This study aimed to analyze the factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG in patients who have severe obesity, and to create a classification system to predict HTN remission and recurrence. Of the 102 patients who underwent LSG at Iwate Medical University Hospital between 2008 and 2020, 62 were enrolled in this study. Factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG were retrospectively analyzed. The HTN remission rate 12-months post-LSG was 40.3%. The remission cohort had a lower number of preoperative antihypertensive drugs (ADs) than that of the non-remission cohort (one and two tablets, respectively; p< 0.001). Additionally, the remission cohort had a statistically significantly smaller visceral fat area (VFA) than that of the non-remission cohort, at all time points. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were independent predictors of remission. The HTN recurrence rate 36-months post-LSG was 36.0%. In the recurrence cohort, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were higher and larger than that in the non-recurrence cohort, respectively. Stratification, based on the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, revealed that the HTN remission and recurrence rates in the sub-cohort with a small number of preoperative ADs and small VFA (100% and 16.7%, respectively) were better than those in the sub-cohort with a large number of preoperative ADs and large VFA (5.3% and 100%, respectively). In Japanese patients with severe obesity, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG. Stratification, by combining the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, may be useful in predicting HTN remission and recurrence.', 'Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.', 'Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and dyslipidemia are both independent predictors of cardiovascular disease, but the association between individual lipid species and subclinical PAD, assessed by ankle-brachial index (ABI), is lacking in large-scale longitudinal studies. We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to repeatedly measure 1,542 lipid species from 1,886 American Indian adults attending 2 clinical examinations (mean ~5 years apart) in the Strong Heart Family Study. We used generalized estimating equation models to identify baseline lipid species associated with change in ABI and the Cox frailty regression to examine whether lipids associated with change in ABI were also associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD). We also examined the longitudinal association between change in lipid species and change in ABI and the cross-sectional association of individual lipids with ABI. All models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, and lipid-lowering medication. Baseline levels of 120 lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, fatty acids, and sphingomyelins, were associated with change in ABI. Among these, higher baseline levels of 3 known lipids (phosphatidylinositol[16:0/20:4], triacylglycerol[48:2], triacylglycerol[55:1]) were associated with a lower risk of CHD (hazard ratios [95% CIs] ranged from 0.67 [0.46–0.99] to 0.76 [0.58–0.99]), while cholesterol was associated with a higher risk of CHD (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.37 [1.00–1.87]). Longitudinal changes in 32 lipids were significantly associated with change in ABI during 5-year follow-up. Plasma levels of glycerophospholipids, triacylglycerols, and glycosylceramides were significantly associated with ABI in the cross-sectional analysis. Altered plasma lipidome is significantly associated with subclinical PAD in American Indians beyond traditional risk factors. If validated, the identified lipid species may serve as novel biomarkers for PAD in this high-risk but understudied population.', 'Lifestyle intervention prevents or delays type 2 diabetes (T2D) in subjects at a high risk of T2D.

While the interplay between LDs and the Golgi apparatus has been recognized, their roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the role of Ras-related protein Rab-2A (Rab2A) in mediating LD-Golgi interactions, thereby contributing to very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipidation and secretion in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, our findings identify a selective interaction between Golgi-localized Rab2A and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) protein residing on LDs. This complex facilitates dynamic organelle communication between the Golgi apparatus and LDs, thus contributing to lipid transfer from LDs to the Golgi apparatus for VLDL2 lipidation and secretion. Attenuation of Rab2A activity via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses the Rab2A-HSD17B13 complex formation, impairing LD-Golgi interactions and subsequent VLDL secretion. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Rab2A and HSD17B13 in the liver reduces the serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels.

The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging.

Plasma levels of glycerophospholipids, triacylglycerols, and glycosylceramides were significantly associated with ABI in the cross-sectional analysis. Altered plasma lipidome is significantly associated with subclinical PAD in American Indians beyond traditional risk factors. If validated, the identified lipid species may serve as novel biomarkers for PAD in this high-risk but understudied population.', 'Red radish microgreens (RRM) have gained considerable attention for their promising therapeutic potential. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their bioactivity remain inadequately characterized.

The metabolite profile of the RRM extract was characterized using comprehensive metabolomics techniques, including Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Liquid Chromatography High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Furthermore, in silico analysis utilizing network pharmacology identified target proteins of RRM compounds associated with cancer, inflammation, and oxidative stress.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a common complication of SLE, significantly increases CHD-related mortality in SLE patients. Despite conventional risk factors, the mechanisms contributing to a higher CHD risk require further investigation, with the immune and inflammatory aspects of SLE playing a significant role. Endothelial cell damage and dysfunction are key factors in the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in SLE patients. This review specifically focuses on endothelial dysfunction and the role of specific microRNAs in the context of SLE and CHD. In addition, we discuss the effects and functions of oxidative stress markers, endothelial progenitor cells, and circulating endothelial cells in individuals with both SLE and CHD. We also explored the typical inflammatory markers associated with SLE and CHD, addressing their clinical significance and limitations.', 'Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a form of severe acute stroke with very high mortality and disability rates. Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.', 'Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.']","Statins prevent cardiovascular disease by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase to lower LDL cholesterol, reducing atherosclerotic plaque formation, and through pleiotropic effects such as anti-inflammatory and plaque-stabilizing properties.",8.798541069030762,10,True,,0.9999999999999994,0.1249999999875,1.0,0.0,,0.6816212781664593,0.3754442065954208,493,1

The documents primarily focus on other medications and treatments such as SGLT2 inhibitors, bivalirudin, sacubitril/valsartan, and Zileuton in the context of heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, or other cardiovascular conditions. Therefore, the specific role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure is not directly addressed in the provided information.","['Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.', 'The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.', 'Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.', 'Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) remains a rare congenital disorder with a wide range of manifestations. The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included “heart failure”, “ccTGA”, “VAD”, “heart transplantation”, and “systemic RV failure”. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data.

The aim was to identify any association between timing of PCSK9i mAb initiation after a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and the rate of subsequent MACE. A retrospective cohort study of adult patients in the United States with a MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) from January 1, 2017 to February 28, 2022 was conducted using administrative claims databases (index date = first observed MACE during this period). Patients were required to have ≥360 days of data visibility prior to (baseline period) and for ≥30 days after the index date (minimum, variable follow up period), and ≥1 prescription claim for PCSK9i mAb therapy on or after the index date. Subsequent MACE rates, time from index MACE to PCSK9i mAb initiation, and time to subsequent MACE were reported. A total of 58,997 patients with ≥1 MACE were identified (mean age = 64 years; 58% male; median follow up=1,241 days). Over half of the patients did not initiate a PCSK9i mAb in the first year after the index MACE. Overall, 35% (n = 20,465) had ≥1 subsequent MACE. Compared to the period between index MACE and prior to PCSK9i mAb initiation, rates of subsequent MACE after PCSK9i mAb initiation were reduced in a time-dependent manner by 70% among patients who initiated PCSK9i mAb therapy within 30 days, 78% (31–90 days), 76% (91–180 days), 65% (181–360 days), and 42% (>360 days) after the index MACE. Those who initiated PCSK9i mAb within 30 days of the index MACE had longer median time to the first subsequent MACE (111 days) compared to patients who initiated at later times. This study provides evidence that earlier initiation of PCSK9i mAb therapy after a MACE appeared to be associated with longer time to a subsequent MACE. Patients without timely treatment are left at an unnecessarily elevated risk of further MACE.', 'Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1- and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist tirzepatide (referred to here collectively as “GLP-1-based therapy”) are incretin-based therapies being used increasingly in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity. They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease.

The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials."", 'Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions.

Nineteen participants with healthy implants restored with titanium or gold-casting abutment were included. PICF and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were collected for inflammatory cytokine detection by ELISA. Cytokine levels in PICF or GCF of the same individual were compared using the paired t-test, and those from titanium or gold-casting (UCLA) abutment were compared using the independent t-test. Human gingival fibroblast responses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and IFNγ expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same individual. However, IL-1β (p = 0.032) and IL-1α (p = 0.030) was statistically significantly higher in PICF than in GCF. IL-8 level was statistically significantly higher with gold-casting than with titanium abutments (p = 0.003). PICF statistically significantly stimulated higher expression of RANKL, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF), while focal adhesion kinase (FAK) suppressed mRNA.

It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.', ""Atherosclerosis (AS) is increasingly recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease that significantly compromises vascular health and serves as a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Defining the CSF cytokine/chemokine and injury biomarker signature of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) autoimmunity can inform immunopathogenesis.

In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.', 'Antimicrobial resistance has recently increased due to emerging carbapenem-resistant  Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae K. pneumoniae K. pneumoniae I K. pneumoniae P P K. pneumoniae', 'Bacterial resistance to antibiotics remains a significant clinical challenge, contributing to persistently high rates of morbidity and mortality.

Meanwhile, transcription factor engineering can trigger metabolic network reprogramming at the global or systemic level, redirecting metabolic flux toward the synthetic pathways of target metabolites. In this study, we modulated pyrimidine and carbon-nitrogen metabolism in  Bacillus subtilis First, cytidine synthesis was enhanced by knocking out the transcriptional regulator PyrR, which increased the cytidine titer during shake flask fermentation to 0.67\xa0g/L. Second, mutations in the transcriptional regulator catabolite control protein A (CcpA) significantly promoted cytidine synthesis, increasing the shake flask titer to 2.03\xa0g/L. Finally, after culture in a 5\xa0L fermenter, the cytidine titer reached 7.65\xa0g/L, which was 3.77-fold that of shake flask fermentation. Moreover, a cytidine yield and productivity of 0.06\xa0g/g glucose and 0.16\xa0g/L/h, respectively, were achieved. Subsequently, the regulatory mechanisms through which PyrR and CcpA modification affect cytidine biosynthesis were explored through multi-omics analysis. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that coordinated alterations in carbon, nitrogen, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism were essential to promote cytidine synthesis. However, the increased cytidine production in recombinant strains was attributed to the enhancement of pyrimidine metabolism, the Phosphotransferase (PTS) system, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, and nitrogen metabolism. These results indicate that PyrR knockdown can enhance pyrimidine metabolic pathway and promote cytidine synthesis.

However, this can be excessive with inappropriate prescribing leading to increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Paediatricians are key initiators of antibiotics. Consequently, their awareness, perceptions, readiness and potential barriers towards hospital-based antimicrobial stewardship programmes are of considerable importance, especially in Pakistan with high rates of AMR. A web-based cross-sectional survey among paediatricians from June to August 2023 using a validated questionnaire. Paediatricians from all four Provinces and the capital territory of Pakistan were invited from randomly selected public and private sector hospitals. 383 paediatricians participated (79.8% response rate). Most were male (87.7%), aged 35\u2005years or less (55.4%), working in tertiary care hospitals (68.4%) and undertaking 51–100 child consultations every day (45%). Only 15% reported obtaining training on antibiotic usage, AMR and/or antimicrobial stewardship. Only 7.6% confirmed functional antimicrobial stewardship programmes in their institutions. Most had adequate knowledge of antibiotic use and AMR. However, key issues were not fully understood with only 27.4% believing antibiotics were being overused among children. Paediatricians with less experience, and who undertook fewer consultations per day, had significantly lower knowledge scores. Most participants were prepared to initiate antimicrobial stewardship programmes; however, perceived barriers included a lack of online learning sources, treatment guidelines and support from hospital administration. Paediatricians had appropriate knowledge about antibiotic use and AMR although concerns with antibiotic use. Important barriers to integrating antimicrobial stewardship programmes were identified, which need addressing for these to become routine.', 'In combating the global epidemic of multidrug-resistant  Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'We assessed the kinetics of the clearance of integrase strand transfer inhibitors resistance mutations (INSTIs-RMs) and associated factors from people living with HIV (PWH) displaying suppressed viral replication after virological failure (VF) on an INSTI regimen.

They can inhibit cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), Janus kinase (JAK), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-Ig (CTLA4-Ig) that contribute to joint inflammation and destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. By blocking these inflammatory signals, biologics help alleviate symptoms, improve joint function, and potentially inhibit joint destruction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","['This study aims to identify factors influencing the alleviation of knee joint symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biologic or target synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs). Among 2321 patients who started b/tsDMARDs between 2010 and 2023, we focused on 295 patients who had knee swelling or tenderness at the initiation of b/tsDMARDs and continued b/tsDMARDs at least 3 months, with recorded knee symptoms 6 months later. Symptom relief after 6 months was 78.2% for interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitors, 68.6% for Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, 65.8% for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and 57.6% for cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-Ig (CTLA4-Ig). The initial use of b/tsDMARDs and the use of IL-6 inhibitors in comparison to CTLA4-Ig emerged as a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms. Among 141 patients who underwent knee radiography at baseline and two years later, the deterioration in knee joint radiographs was 7.7% for IL-6 inhibitors, 6.3% for JAK inhibitors, 21.9% for TNF inhibitors, and 25.9% for CTLA4-Ig.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA and AS patients were treated with UA, and cell viability was measured using the MTS assay and flow cytometry. The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of −5.251 kcal/mol and −6.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients. In the arthritis mouse model, significantly reduced clinical and histological scores were observed in the UA treatment group. Our findings suggest that UA has potential as a binding target for TNF, suppresses inflammatory cytokines in PBMCs, and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on arthritis in a mouse model.', 'Preoperative levels of certain inflammatory markers in the blood can predict acute infection after primary total joint arthroplasty in patients without inflammatory disease, but whether they can do so in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut‐off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio, C‐reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020. We compared preoperative levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C‐reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) between patients who suffered acute infection or not within 90\u2009days after surgery. The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut‐off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut‐off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut‐off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L). The neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%. The preoperative NLR shows some ability to predict acute infection after total joint arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Monitoring this ratio, perhaps in conjunction with other markers not analyzed here, may be useful for optimizing the timing of surgery in order to minimize risk of postoperative infection.', 'The heterogeneity and suboptimal efficacy of biological treatments and small molecule drugs necessitate their precise selection based on biomarkers that predict therapeutic responses in inflammatory bowel disease.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.']","Biologics treat rheumatoid arthritis by targeting specific components of the immune system, such as blocking TNF or IL-6 signaling, or depleting B cells to reduce autoantibody production, thereby interrupting the inflammatory cascade that causes joint damage.",7.684097051620483,10,True,,0.9999999999999997,0.766666666641111,0.75,0.8,,0.5230467706360997,0.42780525982379913,554,1

Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30).

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.', 'Cognitive impairment, a major determinant of poor functioning in schizophrenia, had limited responses to existing antipsychotic drugs. The limited efficacy could be due to regional differences in the dysregulation of the dopamine system. This study investigated striatal and peripheral dopaminergic makers in schizophrenia and their relationship with cognitive impairment. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated. We evaluated their cognitive performance, examined the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT, and measured plasma levels of dopaminergic precursors (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) that compete with precursors for brain uptake via ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Schizophrenia patients exhibited lower cognitive performance, decreased striatal DAT availability, and reduced levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA. Within the patient group, lower DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen was positively associated with attention deficits. Meanwhile, lower tyrosine levels and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA were positively related to executive dysfunction. Among all participants, DAT availability in the right CN or putamen was positively related to memory function, and plasma phenylalanine level was positively associated with executive function. This study supports the role of dopamine system abnormalities in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The distinct associations between different dopaminergic alterations and specific cognitive domain impairments suggest the potential need for multifaceted treatment approaches to target these impairments.', 'Tic disorders represent a developmental neuropsychiatric condition whose causes can be attributed to a variety of environmental, neurobiological, and genetic factors. From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum.

Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (Δscales), OCT (Δretinal thickness), PERG (ΔPERG values) and VEP (ΔP100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral ΔN95 latencies for PERG and ΔP100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT. BLT is a valuable and safe non-pharmacological intervention for improving visual function in PD patients. These findings extend neural mechanisms of BLT to visual pathways improvements.

Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\xa0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo. The study drug will be started within 6\xa0h of randomization. The dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is 1\xa0mg/kg/h, by continuous infusion. The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\xa0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points. This study is the first prospective RCT to investigate the safety of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in TBI patients.

Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan.

The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.', 'Introduction Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS), as similarities in pathophysiology exist between the two. Adipokines are the key molecules that alter the adipose tissue metabolism and distribution, leading to MetS. This study was conducted to assess the levels of adipokines among patients with PCOS with and without MetS and to establish the role of adipokines as an early predictor for the development of MetS in PCOS. Materials and methods In this monocentric, tertiary hospital-based study, 144 patients with PCOS were selected and classified according to Rotterdam criteria and screened for MetS. Patients were grouped into MetS and non-MetS categories based on the presence of MetS. Adipokine levels (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin) were measured and compared, along with other biochemical and anthropological parameters. Data were analyzed using Jamovi statistical software, version 2.3 (Retrieved from  https://www.jamovi.org Results Out of the 144 patients included in the study, 58 were diagnosed with MetS and grouped as MetS. The prevalence of MetS was maximum among the non-PCO\xa0(O+HA) phenotype\xa0(53 out of 58). Significant differences\xa0(p<0.001) in adipokines were observed between the MetS and non-MetS groups. Adiponectin, leptin, and resistin were found to have a significant role as predictors of MetS at an early stage of development of the syndrome, along with other common predictors. However, in later stages, fasting, blood glucose, waist circumference, and triglycerides remain significant predictors. Conclusion The present study reports a high prevalence of MetS among PCOS cases (40.27%). Altered adipokine levels may be significantly associated with the early stages of MetS development and\xa0may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the management of MetS in PCOS. Therefore, the measurement of adipokines during preliminary investigations may be used as an early diagnostic tool for the\xa0management of MetS in PCOS.', 'This study analyzes data from the 2009–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to explore the relationship between the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI), also referred to as the pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) among adults in the United States. Furthermore, it evaluates the mediating effect of obesity indicators on this association. This study included 9,947 individuals from NHANES and applied appropriate weighting techniques. To examine the relationship between AISI and T2DM, we used various statistical models, including weighted multivariable logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, trend tests, mediation analysis, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) models. This research included a total of 9,947 participants, with 3,220 diagnosed with T2DM, while 6,727 remained undiagnosed. Weighted multiple logistic regression with all covariates adjusted indicated that with every one-unit increment in AISI/1000, there was an 88.3% likelihood of T2DM occurrence (OR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.378–2.571). The stratified analysis identified significant differences in this association based on age, biological sex, level of education, poverty-income ratio (PIR), tobacco consumption status, and body mass index (BMI). Interaction tests revealed a positive association between AISI and T2DM, apart from PIR, BMI, age, education attainment, race, gender, tobacco use status, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR), platelet count, and high blood pressure, with none of the interaction p-values falling below 0.05. Nevertheless, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants may affect the strength of this relationship, where an interaction p-value was less than 0.05. Additionally, smoothing curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between AISI and T2DM, marking a significant change at AISI/1000 of 0.21. Mediation analysis indicated that five obesity-related indicators—LAP, VAI, WHtR, WWI and ABSI — partly mediated the association between AISI/1000 and T2DM. An increase in AISI is associated with an elevated probability of T2DM, with obesity indicators potentially mediating this relationship. Reducing AISI and managing obesity may help prevent T2DM. However, with the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships cannot be established. Future research should utilize longitudinal studies to confirm these findings. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02589-4.', ""We report the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy with a history of recurrent and severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy with an uncommon clinical presentation.

We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded.

In the 1970s, as HD became a routine therapy, the observation of complement pathway activation and transient leukopenia by cellulosic dialysis membranes triggered the bioincompatibility debate and its clinical relevance. Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress. Thus, complement-inflammation manifestations in HD therapies extend beyond traditional membrane-related bioincompatibility consequences. Recent scientific knowledge is reshaping strategies to mitigate detrimental consequences of bioincompatibility, both technologically and in HD therapy delivery modes, to improve dialysis patient outcomes.', 'Common treatments for type 2 diabetes include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, oral medications like metformin, and in some cases, insulin therapy.

Therapeutic management consisted of switching the patient to insulin analogs and resuming education concerning the correct injection techniques. The insulin injection technique continues to be suboptimal in many insulin-treated patients, and our case emphasizes the need for improved awareness and education."", 'Assessments for hyperglycemia are vital to pregnancy and postpartum (PP) care, but gold-standard oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) are burdensome. We examined changes in 1,5 anhydroglucitol (1,5AG) levels during gestation and PP and assessed for associations with other measures of glycemia. Pregnant participants (n = 50) in the Study of Pregnancy Regulation of Insulin and Glucose cohort underwent OGTTs at a mean of 13 weeks ([visit 1 (V1)] and 26 weeks [visit 2 (V2)] of gestation and PP. Nonpregnant controls had a single OGTT. 1,5AG was measured using frozen plasma samples. Changes in 1,5AG across pregnancy were assessed with longitudinal mixed effects linear models. We assessed relationships between 1,5AG and glycemia at each timepoint using Spearman correlations and linear regression models. To determine the relationship of 1,5AG with breastfeeding (BF) status, stratified analyses were performed. 1,5AG decreased from V1 to V2 (β = −3.6\u2005μg/mL,  P P P P P P P 1,5AG decreases during gestation and remains low PP.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of GST compared to insulin tolerance test (ITT) in the definition of GHD at adult height achievement. Ninety-seven subjects with childhood-onset GHD (median age, 17.39 years) underwent ITT, GST, and IGF-1 testing; 44 subjects were idiopathic (isolated GHD), 35 moderate organic GHD (0-2 hormone deficiencies) and 18 severe organic GHD (≥3 hormone deficiencies). Bland and Altman analysis showed a high consistency of GH peak measures after ITT and GST. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified 7.3 μg/L as the optimal GH peak cutoff to GST [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.15-8.91; sensitivity 95.7%, specificity 88.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) 88.0%, negative predictive value (NPV) 95.7%] able to correctly classify 91.8% of the entire cohort while 5.8 μg/L was the best GH peak cutoff able to correctly classify 91.4% of moderate organic GHD patients (95% CI 3.16-7.39; sensitivity 96.0%, specificity 80.0%, PPV 92.3%, NPV 88.9%). Patients with ≥3 hormone deficiencies showed a GH peak <5 μg/L at ITT and <5.8 μg/L at GST but 1. The optimal cutoff for IGF-1 was −1.4 SD score (95% CI −1.94 to 0.77; sensitivity 75%, specificity 94%, PPV 91.7%, NPV 81.0%) that correctly classified 85.1% of the study population. A GH peak to GST <5.8 μg/L represents an accurate diagnostic cutoff for young adults with childhood-onset GHD and high pretest probability of permanent GHD.', 'The Golgi apparatus serves multiple crucial roles in the cell.

Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan.

Recently, researchers have developed various carbon dot sensors for fast and real-time Glu monitoring. In this context, we provide a comprehensive introduction to Glu and CDs for the first time. We categorize the synthetic methods for CDs and the sensing mechanisms, further classifying the applications of carbon dot probes into single-probe sensing, ratiometric sensing, and visual detection.

They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease. In this review, we summarize the effects of GLP-1 and incretin-based therapeutics on gastric, biliary and small intestinal function. An improved understanding of these effects will optimize the use of these drugs.', 'Common treatments for type 2 diabetes include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, oral medications like metformin, and in some cases, insulin therapy. Metformin is often the first-line medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes.

The preoperative care of diabetic patients is complex because glucose control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. A variety of diabetic medications such as insulin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and biguanides such as metformin present unique challenges and considerations due to their different mechanisms, benefits, and potential adverse effects. In recent years, professional organizations have developed recommendations on the perioperative management of these therapies, although there remain some variations in guidelines related to medication cessation and dosage adjustments. Standardized protocols in preoperative DM care remain a topic of interest to ensure consistent and safe practices across healthcare settings, and further collaborative research efforts could provide clarity and consensus in managing this diverse patient population. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world. While the key elements are agreed upon, more research and global collaboration are needed to create consistent guidelines and improve patient outcomes.', 'The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.', 'Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been increasingly recognized as a potential exacerbating factor for cardiovascular events in these patients. The CKD-REIN study aims to explore the relationship between AKI and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a cohort of CKD patients. We hypothesize that AKI is a significant and independent predictor of MACE in patients with CKD, and that the severity of AKI correlates with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This prospective cohort study included 3033 adult CKD patients from 40 outpatient nephrology clinics in France. Patients were followed for a median of 5.2 years. AKI episodes were identified and staged based on the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death, were systematically recorded. The association between AKI and MACE was analyzed using a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and baseline kidney function. During the follow-up, 530 patients experienced at least one episode of AKI. The cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year post-AKI was 8.1%. Patients with AKI had a significantly increased risk of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.78 ( P The findings of this study confirm that AKI is a significant independent predictor of MACE in CKD patients, demonstrating a strong severity–response relationship. These results underscore the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring and preventive strategies in CKD patients following AKI episodes. Understanding the mechanisms linking AKI to cardiovascular outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks.', 'IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common primary glomerular disease.

The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Statistical analysis was performed to calculate effect sizes and assess heterogeneity among the studies. This review analyzed 29 out of 1,986 studies, conducted between 2005 and 2022, with participants from multiple countries. Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with age and gender, while associations with hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria were inconsistent. In the meta-analyses, a correlation between serum Gd-IgA1 and estimated glomerular filtration rate was identified, however, the relationships between Gd-IgA1 levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage and progression to kidney failure were inconsistent. Serum Gd-IgA1 levels were not associated with validated prognostic risk factors, but were negatively correlated with kidney function. Further research in larger studies using standardized assays are needed to establish the value of Gd-IgA1 as a prognostic risk factor in IgAN. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40620-023-01874-8.', 'Timing of initiation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy and its impact on cardiovascular outcomes is unknown. The aim was to identify any association between timing of PCSK9i mAb initiation after a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and the rate of subsequent MACE. A retrospective cohort study of adult patients in the United States with a MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) from January 1, 2017 to February 28, 2022 was conducted using administrative claims databases (index date = first observed MACE during this period). Patients were required to have ≥360 days of data visibility prior to (baseline period) and for ≥30 days after the index date (minimum, variable follow up period), and ≥1 prescription claim for PCSK9i mAb therapy on or after the index date. Subsequent MACE rates, time from index MACE to PCSK9i mAb initiation, and time to subsequent MACE were reported. A total of 58,997 patients with ≥1 MACE were identified (mean age = 64 years; 58% male; median follow up=1,241 days). Over half of the patients did not initiate a PCSK9i mAb in the first year after the index MACE. Overall, 35% (n = 20,465) had ≥1 subsequent MACE. Compared to the period between index MACE and prior to PCSK9i mAb initiation, rates of subsequent MACE after PCSK9i mAb initiation were reduced in a time-dependent manner by 70% among patients who initiated PCSK9i mAb therapy within 30 days, 78% (31–90 days), 76% (91–180 days), 65% (181–360 days), and 42% (>360 days) after the index MACE. Those who initiated PCSK9i mAb within 30 days of the index MACE had longer median time to the first subsequent MACE (111 days) compared to patients who initiated at later times. This study provides evidence that earlier initiation of PCSK9i mAb therapy after a MACE appeared to be associated with longer time to a subsequent MACE. Patients without timely treatment are left at an unnecessarily elevated risk of further MACE.', 'Metabolic surgery, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), may improve hypertension (HTN) complicated by severe obesity; however, insufficient deliberation exists regarding the therapeutic effect of post-metabolic surgery on HTN. This study aimed to analyze the factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG in patients who have severe obesity, and to create a classification system to predict HTN remission and recurrence. Of the 102 patients who underwent LSG at Iwate Medical University Hospital between 2008 and 2020, 62 were enrolled in this study. Factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG were retrospectively analyzed. The HTN remission rate 12-months post-LSG was 40.3%. The remission cohort had a lower number of preoperative antihypertensive drugs (ADs) than that of the non-remission cohort (one and two tablets, respectively; p< 0.001). Additionally, the remission cohort had a statistically significantly smaller visceral fat area (VFA) than that of the non-remission cohort, at all time points. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were independent predictors of remission. The HTN recurrence rate 36-months post-LSG was 36.0%. In the recurrence cohort, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were higher and larger than that in the non-recurrence cohort, respectively. Stratification, based on the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, revealed that the HTN remission and recurrence rates in the sub-cohort with a small number of preoperative ADs and small VFA (100% and 16.7%, respectively) were better than those in the sub-cohort with a large number of preoperative ADs and large VFA (5.3% and 100%, respectively). In Japanese patients with severe obesity, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG. Stratification, by combining the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, may be useful in predicting HTN remission and recurrence.', 'Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.']","SGLT2 inhibitors provide cardiovascular benefits by reducing major adverse cardiovascular events and hospitalization for heart failure, effects that appear to be independent of their glucose-lowering action.",4.475999116897583,10,True,,0.9939018287915514,0.7499999999625,1.0,0.6666666666666666,,0.5908983535363436,0.5135589987039566,245,2

This review specifically focuses on endothelial dysfunction and the role of specific microRNAs in the context of SLE and CHD. In addition, we discuss the effects and functions of oxidative stress markers, endothelial progenitor cells, and circulating endothelial cells in individuals with both SLE and CHD.

Recent studies have highlighted that development of AS is closely associated with the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by natural products and formulae derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has been shown to alleviate AS-associated pathologies. However, therapies that effectively and safely target the NLRP3 inflammasome remain limited. This review aims to summarize the key discoveries from recent studies on the effects of these natural products and formulae on the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of AS treatment. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE up to January 2025, yielding 38 eligible studies. Our analysis indicates that certain therapies can effectively prevent arterial inflammation in animal models by targeting multiple pathways and mechanisms related to the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Early brain injury (EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with SAH. Currently, some researchers have started to focus on changes in amino acid metabolism that occur in brain tissues after SAH. Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is semi-essential in animals, and it plays important roles in various processes, such as neurodevelopment, osmotic pressure regulation, and membrane stabilization. In acute stroke, such as cerebral hemorrhage, taurine plays a neuroprotective role. However, the role of taurine after subarachnoid hemorrhage has rarely been reported. In the present study, we established a mouse model of SAH. We found that taurine administration effectively improved the sensorimotor function of these mice. In addition, taurine treatment alleviated sensorimotor neuron damage and reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, taurine treatment enhanced the polarization of astrocytes toward the neuroprotective phenotype while inhibiting their polarization toward the neurotoxic phenotype. This study is the first to reveal the relationship between taurine and astrocyte polarization and may provide a new strategy for SAH research and clinical treatment.', 'Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is an extensively studied dietary pattern which has been proposed as a lifestyle intervention to promote healthy aging in the general population, due to its numerous health benefits. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to explore the mechanism(s) by which the MedDiet exerts its beneficial effects on aging. One proposed mechanism is that the MedDiet helps to slow down a process called ‘inflamm-aging’, a type of chronic, low-grade inflammation which contributes to aging. To explore the evidence supporting this hypothesized mechanism, we conducted a scoping review of existing RCTs which used a MedDiet intervention and assessed at least one molecular outcome of potential relevance to inflamm-aging. We identified 14 papers representing 12 unique RCTs. Based on our findings, we present 10 recommendations for the next clinical trial of the MedDiet in inflamm-aging.', 'Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', ""Bone is a dynamic organ which continuously undergoes remodeling throughout one's lifetime. Cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential for regulating bone homeostasis.

In this study, an anti‐ROS enzyme, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) was found to be expressed both in bone marrow macrophages and osteoclasts. Recombinant Prdx1 protein was found to dose‐dependently inhibit ROS production and osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, Prdx1 protein also attenuated NFATc1 activation as well as the expression of C‐Fos, V‐ATPase‐d2, Cathepsin K, and Integrin αV. Collectively, Prdx1 is a negative regulator on osteoclast formation via inhibiting RANKL‐mediated ROS activity, thus suggesting its potential application for treating osteoclast related disorders."", 'Lipid droplets (LDs) serve as crucial hubs for lipid trafficking and metabolic regulation through their numerous interactions with various organelles. While the interplay between LDs and the Golgi apparatus has been recognized, their roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the role of Ras-related protein Rab-2A (Rab2A) in mediating LD-Golgi interactions, thereby contributing to very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipidation and secretion in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, our findings identify a selective interaction between Golgi-localized Rab2A and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) protein residing on LDs. This complex facilitates dynamic organelle communication between the Golgi apparatus and LDs, thus contributing to lipid transfer from LDs to the Golgi apparatus for VLDL2 lipidation and secretion. Attenuation of Rab2A activity via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses the Rab2A-HSD17B13 complex formation, impairing LD-Golgi interactions and subsequent VLDL secretion. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Rab2A and HSD17B13 in the liver reduces the serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Collectively, this study provides a new perspective on the interactions between the Golgi apparatus and LDs.', 'Cardiac fibrosis occurs in a wide range of cardiac diseases and is characterised by the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts these cells produce large quantities of extracellular matrix, resulting in myocardial scar. The profibrotic process is multi-factorial, meaning identification of effective treatments has been limited. The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts. Utilising cells isolated from a TGR5 knock-out mouse, we identified that the antifibrotic effect of UDCA is attenuated in the KO fibroblasts. This study combines cellular studies with RNA-seq and state-of-the-art living myocardial slices to offer new perspectives on cardiac fibrosis. Our data confirm that TGR5 agonists, such as UDCA, offer a unique pathway of action for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. Medicines for cardiac fibrosis have been slow to clinic and have the potential to be used in the treatment of multiple cardiac diseases. UDCA is well tolerated in the treatment of other diseases, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further in-human trials.', 'Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a common cardiovascular condition marked by peripheral artery stenosis or occlusion. Despite treatment advancements, patients will still face vascular complications, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Human proteins play crucial roles in biology and drug research. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, a gene-based method, is increasingly used in drug target identification. This study aims to identify PAD-associated plasma proteins through MR analysis for potential therapies. We first used GWAS data and seven pQTL datasets to identify plasma proteins causally linked to PAD through MR analysis. Then, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and MR-BMA analysis were carried out to investigate mechanisms and prioritize these proteins. Finally, we assessed the druggability of the target proteins using the DrugBank database. MR analysis found four plasma proteins causally linked to PAD: MMP3 positively correlated with PAD, while CASS4, ISG15, and MMP1 exhibited negative associations. Bayesian colocalization analysis confirmed these relationships, and the MR-BMA analysis prioritized MMP1 as the main target. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways as central to these drug targets. The druggability evaluation indicated that drugs targeting these proteins are either in development or already in clinical use. This study integrates genetic and proteomic data to identify therapeutic targets for PAD and evaluate their potential for drug development. The prioritization of MMP1 and ISG15 as key targets shows promise for PAD treatment, but further validation and clinical exploration of these findings are needed.

hyde,What is the role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure?,"Based on the retrieved documents, the role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure was not specifically mentioned. The documents primarily focused on different treatments, such as sacubitril/valsartan, SGLT2 inhibitors, bivalirudin, and others, for various cardiovascular conditions.","['Although the importance of home blood pressure (BP) management has been widely reported, the achievement rate of home BP targets remains low in Japan. Sacubitril/valsartan is a novel antihypertensive agent with potent antihypertensive effects. Despite its theoretical advantages, the real-world clinical application of sacubitril/valsartan in optimizing home BP management remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings. A cohort of 55 patients, with a mean morning home systolic BP of 135 mmHg or more was enrolled for an 8-week treatment phase with azilsartan and calcium-channel blockers. Morning BP, pulse rate (PR), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and B-type natriuretic peptide, serum potassium, serum uric acid (UA), and hemoglobin A1c levels were assessed at baseline and then at 8, 24, and 48 weeks after switching from 20 mg azilsartan to 200 mg sacubitril/valsartan. At 48 weeks after switching to sacubitril/valsartan, there was a 60% increase in the rate of attainment of home systolic BP targets. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the mean systolic BP (from 143.6 ± 7.0 mmHg to 131.4 ± 8.7 mmHg), diastolic BP (from 86.9 ± 12.3 mmHg to 80.2 ± 10.7 mmHg), PR (from 74.8 ± 11.0 bpm to 72.1 ± 10.1 bpm), and serum UA (from 5.9 ± 1.1 mg/dL to 5.5 ± 0.9 mg/dL) within the first 8 weeks (all p < 0.01). These effects were maintained for 48 weeks. The switch from azilsartan to sacubitril/valsartan treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the achievement of home BP targets, which is consistent with our goal of refining hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.', 'Indications for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. Whether and how the demographic trends in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors have changed after the expansion of indications have not been studied extensively. This study is a descriptive analysis of serial, cross-sectional data on nationwide prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors between April 2016 and March 2023 obtained from NDB Open Data Japan, which contains more than 95% of total health insurance reimbursement claims in the nation. The total number of SGLT2 inhibitor tablets prescribed in outpatient settings with prescriptions papers increased from 577,996,158 tablets in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 904,598,175 tablets in FY 2022. Patients aged 75 years and older accounted for 20.3% of the total prescriptions in FY 2020, and this proportion increased to 27.8% in FY 2022. Among all SGLT2 inhibitors, the tablet that expanded its indications for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease the earliest showed the largest percentage increase in the number of prescribed tablets during this period and the highest share of the elderly population in its recipients in both sexes (men, 35.9%; women, 49.4%) in FY 2022. The number of prescribed SGLT2 inhibitor tablets per population was constantly higher in men than in women between FY 2020 and 2022, which is consistent with the sex difference in the prevalence of these diseases. Prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors to the elderly population is no longer infrequent and accounts for a large portion of the entire prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. These findings contribute to updating our perception on the demographics of SGLT2 inhibitor recipients.', 'The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in older patients remains challenging because standard anticoagulants often fail to yield optimal outcomes. Bivalirudin, a direct inhibitor of thrombin, serves as an alternative to traditional therapies. This drug is particularly effective in enhancing myocardial microcirculation and reducing adverse events after clinical interventions. The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators. It further mitigated the risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent myocardial infarctions. These findings suggest that bivalirudin can enhance myocardial perfusion and reduce bleeding complications, thus serving as a safe, effective anticoagulation agent for older patients with ACS. Nonetheless, further large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal usage guidelines and assess long-term outcomes. Integrating bivalirudin into ACS treatment protocols for older patients may help optimize patient care, balancing efficacy and safety. Continual research and consensus building are necessary for the widespread clinical application of bivalirudin and the improvement of ACS outcomes in older patients.', 'Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) remains a rare congenital disorder with a wide range of manifestations. The management of heart failure (HF) of the systemic right ventricle (RV), arrhythmias, heart block, and acquired cardiac conditions require a complex and multi-faceted approach. The objective of this manuscript is to present the current evidence regarding diagnostic, treatment, and management strategies for HF in ccTGA, including ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy and heart transplantation. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, covering the period between 2010 and 2024. The search terms included “heart failure”, “ccTGA”, “VAD”, “heart transplantation”, and “systemic RV failure”. Two clinical cases were included for illustrative purposes. HF is a common occurrence in the context of ccTGA, primarily driven by progressive pressure and volume overload of the systemic RV, regurgitation of the systemic atrio-ventricular (AV) valve, and the development of arrhythmias, including complete heart block and (supra-)ventricular tachycardia. The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions. Optimal management remains a topic of debate due to the scarcity of outcome data.

They are now recognized to have beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control and weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal protection. GLP-1-based therapy also slows gastric emptying, which has benefits (lowering postprandial glucose), but also potential risks (eg, hypoglycemia in individuals on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy). Their effects on the gallbladder may also be beneficial, contributing to reducing postprandial triglycerides, but they also potentially increase the risk of biliary disease. In this review, we summarize the effects of GLP-1 and incretin-based therapeutics on gastric, biliary and small intestinal function. An improved understanding of these effects will optimize the use of these drugs.', 'Metabolic surgery, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), may improve hypertension (HTN) complicated by severe obesity; however, insufficient deliberation exists regarding the therapeutic effect of post-metabolic surgery on HTN. This study aimed to analyze the factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG in patients who have severe obesity, and to create a classification system to predict HTN remission and recurrence. Of the 102 patients who underwent LSG at Iwate Medical University Hospital between 2008 and 2020, 62 were enrolled in this study. Factors correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG were retrospectively analyzed. The HTN remission rate 12-months post-LSG was 40.3%. The remission cohort had a lower number of preoperative antihypertensive drugs (ADs) than that of the non-remission cohort (one and two tablets, respectively; p< 0.001). Additionally, the remission cohort had a statistically significantly smaller visceral fat area (VFA) than that of the non-remission cohort, at all time points. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were independent predictors of remission. The HTN recurrence rate 36-months post-LSG was 36.0%. In the recurrence cohort, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were higher and larger than that in the non-recurrence cohort, respectively. Stratification, based on the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, revealed that the HTN remission and recurrence rates in the sub-cohort with a small number of preoperative ADs and small VFA (100% and 16.7%, respectively) were better than those in the sub-cohort with a large number of preoperative ADs and large VFA (5.3% and 100%, respectively). In Japanese patients with severe obesity, the number of preoperative ADs and VFA were correlated with HTN remission and recurrence post-LSG. Stratification, by combining the number of preoperative ADs and VFA, may be useful in predicting HTN remission and recurrence.']","ACE inhibitors treat heart failure by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which reduces vasoconstriction and aldosterone production, decreases afterload and preload, improves cardiac output, and ultimately reduces mortality and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.",3.6337437629699707,10,True,,0.8983945745653253,0.249999999975,1.0,1.0,,0.20437835472246768,0.4124109953641891,278,2
hyde,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α. This suppression is achieved through various mechanisms, including the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, which blocks the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Additionally, glucocorticoids can also modulate the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes like heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These dual actions of glucocorticoids on both inflammation and oxidative stress pathways contribute to their anti-inflammatory effects.","['Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', ""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials."", 'Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease driven by a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune components. Among these, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like lymphocytes have emerged as crucial players in shaping the disease phenotype. Within the ILC family, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), in particular, contribute significantly to type 2 inflammation through their rapid production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, promoting airway eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity. On the other hand, innate-like lymphocytes such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can play either pathogenic or protective roles in asthma, depending on the stimuli and lung microenvironment. Regulatory mechanisms, including cytokine signaling, metabolic and dietary cues, and interactions with other immune cells, play critical roles in modulating their functions. In this review, we highlight current findings on the role of ILCs and innate-like lymphocytes in asthma development and pathogenesis. We also examine the underlying mechanisms regulating their function and their interplay with other immune cells. Finally, we explore current therapies targeting these cells and their effector cytokines for asthma management.', 'Long COVID is a debilitating condition that lasts for more than three months post-infection by SARS–CoV–2. On average, one in ten individuals infected with SARS CoV- 2 develops Long COVID worldwide.

RNA modifications, arising from the epitranscriptome or RNA‐modifying protein mutations, have recently been observed to contribute significantly to neurodegenerative disorders. Specific modifications like N6‐methyladenine (m6A), N1‐methyladenine (m1A), 5‐methylcytosine (m5C), pseudouridine and adenosine‐to‐inosine (A‐to‐I) play key roles, with their regulators serving as crucial therapeutic targets. These epitranscriptomic changes intricately control gene expression, influencing cellular functions and contributing to disease pathology. Dysregulation of RNA metabolism, affecting mRNA processing and noncoding RNA biogenesis, is a central factor in these diseases. This review underscores the complex relationship between RNA modifications and neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing the influence of RNA modification and the epitranscriptome, exploring the function of RNA modification enzymes in neurodegenerative processes, investigating the functional consequences of RNA modifications within neurodegenerative pathways, and evaluating the potential therapeutic advancements derived from assessing the epitranscriptome.', 'The Golgi apparatus serves multiple crucial roles in the cell.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'The transcription factor SOX9 is integral to tissue homeostasis and is implicated in skeletal malformation, campomelic dysplasia, and osteoarthritis (OA). Despite extensive research, the complete regulatory landscape of SOX9 transcriptional activity, interconnected with signaling pathways (TGFβ, WNT, BMP, IHH, NFκB, and HIF), remains challenging to decipher. This study focuses on elucidating SOX9 signaling in OA pathology using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) to assess SOX9 activity directly in live human primary chondrocytes (hPCs). Single cell FRAP data revealed two distinct subpopulations with differential SOX9 dynamics, showing varied distribution between healthy and OA hPCs. Moreover, inherently elevated SOX9‐DNA binding was observed in healthy hPCs compared to preserved and OA counterparts. Anabolic factors (BMP7 and GREM1) and catabolic inhibitors (DKK1 and FRZb) were found to modulate SOX9 transcriptional activity in OA‐hPCs. These findings provide valuable insights into the intricate regulation of SOX9 signaling in OA, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for modulating SOX9 activity in diseased states.', 'Periodontitis is associated with numerous systemic diseases, and it has been shown that these associations are partly causal in nature. It is assumed that such interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases are also mediated via adipokines. Apelin, an adipokine about which there is little research in the dental field, is also produced together with its receptor in periodontal cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the currently available literature on the apelin-APJ system to better understand the pathomechanistic relationship between periodontitis and obesity and to determine the potential clinical relevance of apelin for diagnostics and therapy. In vitro studies suggest that apelin can enhance bacterial-induced synthesis of proinflammatory and proteolytic molecules, indicating a significant etiopathogenic role of this adipokine. Since serum levels of apelin are elevated in diabetes and/or obesity, it is possible that such systemic diseases promote the development and progression of periodontitis via apelin. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that apelin from the periodontium influences such systemic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the role of apelin in the periodontium and the entire oral cavity, but also in the interactions between periodontal and systemic diseases. In particular, clinical intervention studies are needed to further decipher the etiopathogenic role of apelin in periodontitis.', 'Transcription factors (TFs) orchestrating lineage-development often control genes required for cellular survival. However, it is not well understood how cells survive when such TFs are lost, for example in cancer. PU.1 is an essential TF for myeloid fate, and mice with downregulated PU.1 levels develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Combining a multi-omics approach with a functional genetic screen, we reveal that PU.1-downregulated cells fundamentally change their survival control from cytokine-driven pathways to overexpression of an autophagy-predominated stem cell gene program, for which we also find evidence in human AML. Control of this program involves redirected chromatin occupancy of the PU.1 partner TF Runx1 to a lineage-inappropriate binding site repertoire. Hence, genomic reallocation of TF binding upon loss of a partner TF can act as a pro-oncogenic failsafe mechanism by sustaining cell survival during leukemogenesis.']","Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by binding to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors that translocate to the nucleus, where they suppress pro-inflammatory gene transcription and induce anti-inflammatory protein expression.",7.083493709564209,10,True,,1.0,0.5833333333041666,1.0,0.0,,0.7492367621944647,0.3531293928623199,679,2

However, the spectrum of ARGs in the dust resistome in workplaces and households has gone relatively unexplored. This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants’ workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR.

Finally, after culture in a 5\xa0L fermenter, the cytidine titer reached 7.65\xa0g/L, which was 3.77-fold that of shake flask fermentation. Moreover, a cytidine yield and productivity of 0.06\xa0g/g glucose and 0.16\xa0g/L/h, respectively, were achieved. Subsequently, the regulatory mechanisms through which PyrR and CcpA modification affect cytidine biosynthesis were explored through multi-omics analysis. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that coordinated alterations in carbon, nitrogen, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism were essential to promote cytidine synthesis. However, the increased cytidine production in recombinant strains was attributed to the enhancement of pyrimidine metabolism, the Phosphotransferase (PTS) system, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, and nitrogen metabolism. These results indicate that PyrR knockdown can enhance pyrimidine metabolic pathway and promote cytidine synthesis.

A web-based cross-sectional survey among paediatricians from June to August 2023 using a validated questionnaire. Paediatricians from all four Provinces and the capital territory of Pakistan were invited from randomly selected public and private sector hospitals. 383 paediatricians participated (79.8% response rate). Most were male (87.7%), aged 35\u2005years or less (55.4%), working in tertiary care hospitals (68.4%) and undertaking 51–100 child consultations every day (45%). Only 15% reported obtaining training on antibiotic usage, AMR and/or antimicrobial stewardship. Only 7.6% confirmed functional antimicrobial stewardship programmes in their institutions. Most had adequate knowledge of antibiotic use and AMR. However, key issues were not fully understood with only 27.4% believing antibiotics were being overused among children. Paediatricians with less experience, and who undertook fewer consultations per day, had significantly lower knowledge scores. Most participants were prepared to initiate antimicrobial stewardship programmes; however, perceived barriers included a lack of online learning sources, treatment guidelines and support from hospital administration. Paediatricians had appropriate knowledge about antibiotic use and AMR although concerns with antibiotic use.

hyde,How do biologics treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Biologics treat rheumatoid arthritis by targeting specific inflammatory pathways, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. These biologics inhibit the inflammatory response in the joints, leading to symptom relief and potentially slowing down joint destruction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, natural compounds like Usenamine A (UA) have also shown potential in suppressing inflammatory cytokines and exhibiting anti-inflammatory effects on arthritis.","['This study aims to identify factors influencing the alleviation of knee joint symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biologic or target synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs). Among 2321 patients who started b/tsDMARDs between 2010 and 2023, we focused on 295 patients who had knee swelling or tenderness at the initiation of b/tsDMARDs and continued b/tsDMARDs at least 3 months, with recorded knee symptoms 6 months later. Symptom relief after 6 months was 78.2% for interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitors, 68.6% for Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, 65.8% for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and 57.6% for cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-Ig (CTLA4-Ig). The initial use of b/tsDMARDs and the use of IL-6 inhibitors in comparison to CTLA4-Ig emerged as a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms. Among 141 patients who underwent knee radiography at baseline and two years later, the deterioration in knee joint radiographs was 7.7% for IL-6 inhibitors, 6.3% for JAK inhibitors, 21.9% for TNF inhibitors, and 25.9% for CTLA4-Ig. The use of IL-6 inhibitors was a significant factor associated with the improvement of knee joint symptoms and the inhibition of joint destruction compared to CTLA4-Ig.', 'Usenamine A (UA) is a natural compound isolated from the lichen  Usnea diffracta Molecular docking was performed between the 3D structure of UA and the TNF-TNFR2 complex. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA and AS patients were treated with UA, and cell viability was measured using the MTS assay and flow cytometry. The in vitro effects of co-culture with UA were determined by measuring inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The in vivo effects of UA were evaluated using an arthritis mouse model. The docking complex of UA bound to the TNF-TNFR2 complex exhibited docking scores of −5.251 kcal/mol and −6.274 kcal/mol, confirming their active sites. UA did not affect cell viability and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of RA (IFN-γ, IL-17A, and GM-CSF) and AS (GM-CSF) patients. The ELISA also confirmed reduced cytokine levels in the co-culture of UA and PBMCs from RA or AS patients. In the arthritis mouse model, significantly reduced clinical and histological scores were observed in the UA treatment group. Our findings suggest that UA has potential as a binding target for TNF, suppresses inflammatory cytokines in PBMCs, and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on arthritis in a mouse model.', 'Preoperative levels of certain inflammatory markers in the blood can predict acute infection after primary total joint arthroplasty in patients without inflammatory disease, but whether they can do so in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine whether, with appropriate cut‐off values, (1) preoperative levels of NLR predicted postoperative acute infection; and (2) preoperative plasma fibrinogen, monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio, C‐reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted postoperative acute infection. We retrospectively analyzed 964 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty at our hospital between January 2010 and November 2020. We compared preoperative levels of inflammatory markers including neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C‐reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma fibrinogen (FIB) between patients who suffered acute infection or not within 90\u2009days after surgery. The ability of markers to predict infection was assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on optimal cut‐off values determined from the Youden index. Among the 964 patients, 27 (2.8%) experienced acute infection. Preoperative levels of individual inflammatory markers predicted infection with the following AUCs and cut‐off values: NLR, 0.704 (cut‐off: 2.528); MLR, 0.608 (0.2317); CRP, 0.516 (4.125\u2009mg/L); ESR, 0.533 (66.5\u2009mm/h); and FIB, 0.552 (3.415\u2009g/L). The neutrophil‐lymphocyte ratio showed diagnostic sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 43.3%, while the monocyte‐lymphocyte ratio showed sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 46.3%. The preoperative NLR shows some ability to predict acute infection after total joint arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Monitoring this ratio, perhaps in conjunction with other markers not analyzed here, may be useful for optimizing the timing of surgery in order to minimize risk of postoperative infection.', 'The heterogeneity and suboptimal efficacy of biological treatments and small molecule drugs necessitate their precise selection based on biomarkers that predict therapeutic responses in inflammatory bowel disease.

Covariates included gender, age, race, marital status, body mass index (BMI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and diabetes status. Multivariate logistic regression and subgroup analyses were used to assess the relationship between HCV infection and RA risk. In this population-based study involving 5,825 participants aged 18–80 years (including 485 RA patients), we observed a significantly higher prevalence of HCV infection in the RA group compared with non-RA controls. After adjusting for covariates, multivariate logistic regression showed that HCV infection was associated with an increased risk of RA (OR\u2009=\u20091.93; 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.07–3.50,  p This study demonstrates that HCV infection is associated with the risk of RA in adults, underscoring the potential value of HCV screening in RA patients for improved disease management.

Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-15, and IL-17 increased at the 12-month follow-up, potentially due to the additional training. However, the athletes did not report any discomfort or injuries, and no abnormalities were detected by ultrasonography after study. We demonstrated improvements in pain and functional scores, as well as knee injury protection in athletes, following 12\xa0months of PRP and PRP with ESWT treatments.

Delivery of a pro‐angiogenic stimulus via acellular materials offers several benefits over biological therapies but has been hampered by interaction of the implanted material with the innate immune response. However, macrophages, a key component of the innate immune response, release a plurality of soluble factors that can be harnessed to stimulate neovascularization and restore blood flow to damaged tissue. This study investigates the ability of biodegradable poly(D,L‐lactic‐co‐glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres to restore tissue perfusion in a hind limb model of ischaemia. Microspheres exhibiting a hierarchical porous structure are associated with an increase in blood flow at day 21 post‐implantation compared with solid microspheres composed of the same polymer. This corresponds with an increase in blood vessel density in the surrounding tissue. In vitro simulation of the foreign body response observed demonstrates M2‐like macrophages incubated with the porous microspheres secreted increased amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) compared with M1‐like macrophages providing a potential mechanism for the increased neovascularization. The results from this study demonstrate implantable biodegradable porous microspheres provide a novel approach for increasing neovascularization that could be exploited for therapeutic applications.', 'Background Skin and soft tissue infections are a significant healthcare concern, ranging from mild cases treated with topical therapy to severe infections requiring systemic antibiotics and surgical intervention. The increasing global antibiotic resistance, particularly involving  Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pyogenes S. aureus S. pyogenes Methodology A quasi-experimental study was conducted between January and April 2023 at the Dominican Dermatological Institute and Skin Surgery “Dr. Huberto Bogaert Díaz.” Patients presenting with clinically infected wounds were enrolled to assess the efficacy of 2% mupirocin cream. The intervention involved applying the cream three times daily for 10 days. The primary outcomes were therapeutic response and incidence of adverse effects. Therapeutic response was assessed using SIRS, which evaluates erythema, swelling, discharge, and local warmth, each scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe), for a total score ranging from 0 to 12. Baseline scores were recorded on day one, and follow-up scores on day 11. A therapeutic response was defined as a reduction of 50% or more in the total SIRS score compared to baseline. Adverse effects were monitored through physical examination and patient interviews. Results Of the 135 patients treated, 134 (99.2%) exhibited a favorable therapeutic response without adverse effects. Only one (0.7%) patient developed an allergic reaction, characterized by a skin rash, which led to the discontinuation of the treatment.

Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA), a novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid, was obtained from Menispermi Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions in clinical practice. This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases. By strategically modulating this interaction, it may be feasible to achieve more precise regulation of inflammatory responses, thereby offering promising therapeutic benefits for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.', ""Bone is a dynamic organ which continuously undergoes remodeling throughout one's lifetime.

In this study, an anti‐ROS enzyme, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) was found to be expressed both in bone marrow macrophages and osteoclasts. Recombinant Prdx1 protein was found to dose‐dependently inhibit ROS production and osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, Prdx1 protein also attenuated NFATc1 activation as well as the expression of C‐Fos, V‐ATPase‐d2, Cathepsin K, and Integrin αV.

This helps to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease by increasing dopamine levels in the brain, which helps to improve motor function.","['Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation is considered a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of PD. Current gold-standard therapies for PD provide only symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, highlighting the need to develop new disease-modifying treatments. Metformin has been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This study aimed to clarify the role of metformin as adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. Sixty patients with PD were divided into 2 groups (n = 30).

DBS surgery carries risks, e.g. the risk of delayed peri-lead edema (PLE) and the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. The mechanisms of these complications are not fully understood and there is no established biomarker to screen for these complications after DBS surgery. To explore the diagnostic value of two blood-based markers representative for distinct types of brain injury, we characterized the dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP, for glial injury) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL, for neuronal-axonal injury) following DBS surgery. We analyzed longitudinal dynamics of serum protein levels in 58 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) at our center for half a year post-surgery. Serum GFAP responded much more rapidly after brain surgery, returning to baseline after weeks, whereas sNfL only returned to baseline after months. Patients with lower preoperative cognitive performance exhibited higher postoperative sGFAP levels, with sGFAP showing a stronger association with preoperative patient characteristics compared to sNfL. Further studies with long-term clinical follow-up are needed to fully evaluate the utility of sGFAP as a biomarker for both early and delayed complications after DBS surgery, including cognitive decline and potential foreign body reactions to the implanted lead.', 'Tic disorders represent a developmental neuropsychiatric condition whose causes can be attributed to a variety of environmental, neurobiological, and genetic factors. From a neurophysiological perspective, the disorder has classically been associated with neurochemical imbalances (particularly dopamine and serotonin) and structural and functional alterations affecting, in particular, brain areas and circuits involved in the processing and coordination of movements: the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortical area, and cingulate cortex; however, more recent research is demonstrating the involvement of many more brain regions and neurotransmission systems than previously observed, such as the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In this paper, therefore, we summarize the evidence to date on these abnormalities with the intent to illustrate and clarify the main neuroanatomical differences between patients with tic disorders and healthy individuals.', 'Bright light therapy (BLT) has been proved to have beneficial effects on Parkinson’s disease (PD), the mechanisms remained unclear. Improvements of visual pathways might be key to BLT. The aim of this study is to validate whether BLT improves clinical symptoms in PD and explore the possible mechanisms of visual pathways evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Twenty-three PD patients were enrolled in this crossover randomized placebo-controlled study. Participants received either one month of BLT or dim light therapy (DLT), separated by one-month wash-out period, followed by another intervention. Participants underwent clinical scales, and visual-related evaluations including OCT, PERG and VEP before and after each intervention. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (Δscales), OCT (Δretinal thickness), PERG (ΔPERG values) and VEP (ΔP100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT. Compared with DLT, bilateral ΔN95 latencies for PERG and ΔP100 latencies for VEP were improved after BLT. We did not observe the changes of four quadrants retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after BLT or DLT.

The limited efficacy could be due to regional differences in the dysregulation of the dopamine system. This study investigated striatal and peripheral dopaminergic makers in schizophrenia and their relationship with cognitive impairment. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated. We evaluated their cognitive performance, examined the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT, and measured plasma levels of dopaminergic precursors (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) that compete with precursors for brain uptake via ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Schizophrenia patients exhibited lower cognitive performance, decreased striatal DAT availability, and reduced levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA. Within the patient group, lower DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen was positively associated with attention deficits. Meanwhile, lower tyrosine levels and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA were positively related to executive dysfunction. Among all participants, DAT availability in the right CN or putamen was positively related to memory function, and plasma phenylalanine level was positively associated with executive function. This study supports the role of dopamine system abnormalities in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The distinct associations between different dopaminergic alterations and specific cognitive domain impairments suggest the potential need for multifaceted treatment approaches to target these impairments.', 'Previous studies have shown an association between the thalamocortical dysconnectivity and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Whether a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine may change thalamocortical connectivity among patients with TRD is unclear. Whether these changes in thalamocortical connectivity is associated with the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine treatment is also unclear. Two resting-state functional MRIs were collected in two clinical trials of 48 patients with TRD (clinical trial 1; 32 receiving ketamine, 16 receiving a normal saline placebo) and 48 patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation (clinical trial 2; 24 receiving ketamine, 24 receiving midazolam), respectively. All participants underwent rs-fMRI before and 3 days after infusion. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) was analyzed in the left/right thalamus. FCs between the bilateral thalamus and right middle frontal cortex (BA46) and between the left thalamus and left anterior paracingulate gyrus (BA8) increased among patients in the ketamine group in clinical trials 1 and 2, respectively. FCs between the right thalamus and bilateral frontal pole (BA9) and between the right thalamus and left rostral paracingulate gyrus (BA10) decreased among patients in the ketamine group in clinical trials 1 and 2, respectively. However, the associations between those FC changes and clinical symptom changes did not survive statistical significance after multiple comparison corrections. Whether ketamine-related changes in thalamocortical connectivity may be associated with ketamine’s antidepressant and antisuicidal effects would need further investigation.

Prolonged sedation is often necessary. The most commonly used sedatives in TBI are propofol and midazolam, often in combination, but both have significant side effects when used at high doses for several days. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, provides sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression or haemodynamic instability. However, ketamine carries a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precaution regarding its use in patients with pre-anaesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which discourages its use in TBI patients. Several observational studies and two large meta-analyses do not suggest that the use of ketamine as an induction agent or sedative in sedated and mechanically ventilated TBI patients would increase the ICP. Off-label use of ketamine for this indication is increasing worldwide. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) has demonstrated the safety of ketamine in TBI patients. The Brain Injury and Ketamine (BIKe) study is a prospective multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, to evaluate the safety, and effect on therapeutic intensity to reduce ICP, of ketamine as an adjunct to a standard sedation regimen in patients with severe TBI. Adult TBI patients, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), requiring sedation and ICP monitoring within 72\xa0h of admission, will be randomized to ketamine or placebo.

The IMP will be stopped when the last ICP control sedative is discontinued. Data collection will stop when the patient is discharged from the ICU. All patients will be followed for 6\xa0months post-trauma. The study is powered for the safety endpoint of detecting a clinically relevant increase of two episodes in the median number of episodes of high intracranial pressure episodes per ICU stay. A total of 100 patients are required to meet these objectives. We hypothesize a clinically relevant reduction in the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) score of at least 3 points.

crag,What are the effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes?,"Based on the information provided, metformin is a common oral medication used as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. It helps lower glucose production in the liver and improves insulin sensitivity. This suggests that metformin plays a crucial role in managing blood sugar levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Additionally, other documents mention the importance of careful management of diabetes, especially in the perioperative setting, to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. This includes balancing glucose control with minimizing hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery. This implies that medications like insulin and dipeptidyl-peptidas are also used in managing diabetes in different settings.

Furthermore, another document discusses the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes who experienced severe hypoglycemia related to lipodystrophy, highlighting the challenges and complexities involved in managing diabetes in certain individuals.

Moreover, incretin-based therapies like glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are being used increasingly in the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity, showing beneficial effects beyond improved glycemic control. This suggests that there are alternative treatment options available for individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Lastly, lifestyle interventions have been shown to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals. The T2D-GENE trial investigated whether genetic variants modify the effect of lifestyle interventions on incident type 2 diabetes.

In conclusion, metformin has significant effects on type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity and lowering glucose production. However, the management of diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle interventions, oral medications like metformin, insulin therapy, and other medications to balance glucose control and minimize complications.

All models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, and lipid-lowering medication. Baseline levels of 120 lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, fatty acids, and sphingomyelins, were associated with change in ABI. Among these, higher baseline levels of 3 known lipids (phosphatidylinositol[16:0/20:4], triacylglycerol[48:2], triacylglycerol[55:1]) were associated with a lower risk of CHD (hazard ratios [95% CIs] ranged from 0.67 [0.46–0.99] to 0.76 [0.58–0.99]), while cholesterol was associated with a higher risk of CHD (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.37 [1.00–1.87]).

Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action.

crag,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones that have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. They work by suppressing the inflammatory response in the body through various mechanisms. One of the key ways in which glucocorticoids suppress inflammation is by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and proteins. This includes reducing the production of cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators of inflammation that are involved in the immune response.

Glucocorticoids also inhibit the activity of immune cells, such as macrophages and T cells, that are involved in the inflammatory response. By dampening the function of these immune cells, glucocorticoids can reduce the overall inflammatory response in the body.

Additionally, glucocorticoids have been shown to decrease the permeability of blood vessels, which helps to reduce the migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation. This can further limit the inflammatory response and prevent tissue damage.

It is important to note that while glucocorticoids are effective in suppressing inflammation, they can also have side effects, particularly with long-term use. These side effects may include immune suppression, bone loss, weight gain, and increased risk of infections. Therefore, glucocorticoids should be used judiciously and under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

In conclusion, glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the expression and activity of pro-inflammatory mediators and immune cells. Their anti-inflammatory effects make them valuable therapeutic agents for a variety of inflammatory conditions, but their use should be carefully monitored to minimize potential side effects.","[""Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells.

MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect.

crag,What are the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance?,"Based on the provided documents, the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance include the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus, and other microorganisms. These resistance genes limit the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobials, leading to increased prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in humans, animals, and the environment. The resistance genes in bacteria have been found to contribute to persistently high rates of morbidity and mortality, making treatment success increasingly difficult to achieve.

The documents also suggest that the spectrum of ARGs in different environments, such as workplaces, households, hospitals, livestock, and wastewater, has not been fully explored. This highlights the need for further research to identify and understand the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in various settings to effectively combat the global epidemic of multidrug-resistant bacteria.

crag,How do biologics treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Biologics are a type of medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis by targeting specific molecules in the immune system that are responsible for the inflammation and joint damage characteristic of the disease. Biologics are a subset of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and are often referred to as biologic DMARDs or b/tsDMARDs. These medications are typically prescribed when traditional DMARDs have not been effective in managing symptoms or slowing the progression of rheumatoid arthritis.

Biologics work by blocking specific proteins, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), or B cells, that play a key role in the inflammatory response. By targeting these proteins, biologics help to reduce inflammation, prevent joint damage, and improve overall quality of life for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Based on the information provided in the documents, it is clear that biologics are effective in alleviating symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in patients with knee joint involvement. These medications have been shown to improve knee swelling and tenderness in patients who have not responded to other treatments.

While the specific mechanism of action of biologics may vary depending on the type of medication and the target protein, the overall goal of treatment remains the same: to reduce inflammation and slow the progression of joint damage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It is important to note that biologics are typically prescribed by a rheumatologist and require regular monitoring to assess their effectiveness and manage any potential side effects.

In conclusion, biologics are an important treatment option for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, particularly those who have not responded to traditional DMARDs. These medications target specific proteins in the immune system to reduce inflammation and improve joint symptoms, ultimately helping patients to better manage their condition and improve their quality of life.","[""Document(page_content='This study aims to identify factors influencing the alleviation of knee joint symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biologic or target synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs).

crag,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"Levodopa is a medication commonly used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The mechanism of action of levodopa involves its conversion to dopamine in the brain. In Parkinson's disease, there is a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a decrease in dopamine levels. Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, levodopa is converted to dopamine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase.

By increasing dopamine levels in the brain, levodopa helps to alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However, it is important to note that levodopa does not slow down the progression of the disease or prevent the loss of dopaminergic neurons. It primarily provides symptomatic relief by replenishing dopamine levels in the brain.

While the broader search results did not directly address the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease, the information provided in Document 1 about the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the need for new disease-modifying treatments indirectly supports the role of levodopa in replenishing dopamine levels to alleviate symptoms.

Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the effect between BLT and DLT on improving the differentials of clinical scales (Δscales), OCT (Δretinal thickness), PERG (ΔPERG values) and VEP (ΔP100 latencies). Correlations between clinical symptoms and visual evaluations improvements were analyzed in PD patients receiving BLT. Excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, life quality and autonomic function were improved after BLT.

crag,What are the effects of metformin on type 2 diabetes?,"Based on the information provided in the documents, metformin is a common first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. It works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity. Metformin is often prescribed alongside lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise for managing type 2 diabetes.

Document 2 mentions the importance of careful management of diabetes, including glucose control, in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. This suggests that metformin, as a medication for type 2 diabetes, may play a role in perioperative management to maintain stable glucose levels.

Document 3 discusses a case of a patient with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy who experienced severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. This highlights the potential risks associated with diabetes medications, including insulin, in managing blood sugar levels. Metformin, being a commonly used medication for type 2 diabetes, may also have associated risks or side effects that need to be monitored and managed.

Document 4 mentions GLP-1 receptor agonists and other incretin-based therapies that are increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes. These medications have beneficial effects beyond glycemic control. While metformin is not specifically mentioned in this document, it suggests that there are multiple treatment options available for managing type 2 diabetes, each with its own unique effects and benefits.

Document 5 discusses the role of lifestyle intervention in preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes in individuals at high risk. It also explores the potential effects of genetic variants on incident type 2 diabetes during lifestyle intervention. While metformin is not directly addressed in this document, it emphasizes the importance of personalized approaches to diabetes management based on individual risk factors and genetic factors.

Overall, based on the available information, metformin appears to be an effective first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, helping to lower blood glucose levels and improve insulin sensitivity. However, like any medication, it may have associated risks or side effects that need to be monitored. Additionally, there are other treatment options available for managing type 2 diabetes, highlighting the importance of individualized care and a multidisciplinary approach to diabetes management.","[""Document(page_content='Common treatments for type 2 diabetes include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, oral medications like metformin, and in some cases, insulin therapy.

crag,How do glucocorticoids suppress inflammation?,"Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting the production of anti-inflammatory mediators. These powerful anti-inflammatory effects are achieved through various mechanisms, including the suppression of immune cell activation and migration, inhibition of inflammatory gene expression, and modulation of signaling pathways involved in the inflammatory response.

From the provided documents, it is evident that inflammation is a common underlying factor in various diseases, such as atherosclerosis, neuroinflammation, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, are known to be potent anti-inflammatory agents that play a crucial role in regulating the immune response and maintaining homeostasis in the body.

In document 1, Fucoxanthin is highlighted for its anti-inflammatory properties, which may potentially involve the modulation of inflammatory pathways and cytokine production. This suggests that natural compounds like Fucoxanthin can also influence the inflammatory response similar to glucocorticoids.

Document 3 discusses the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in atherosclerosis, indicating that targeting specific inflammatory pathways, such as the NLRP3 inflammasome, can help in preventing or treating inflammatory diseases. Glucocorticoids may also exert their anti-inflammatory effects by interfering with these pathways.

Document 4 mentions Menisoxoisoaporphine A (MA) as a potential therapeutic agent for inflammatory conditions, indicating that natural products can be promising alternatives to traditional glucocorticoids in managing inflammation.

Overall, while the provided documents do not directly address how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation, they do highlight the importance of targeting inflammatory pathways and cytokine production in various diseases. Glucocorticoids likely exert their anti-inflammatory effects through similar mechanisms, by regulating immune responses and inflammatory mediators to reduce tissue damage caused by excessive inflammation.","[""Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.42549756169319153, 'retrieval_method': 'knowledge_base_expansion'}, id='PMC1748704565')"", 'Document(page_content=""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells.

crag,What are the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance?,"Based on the provided documents, the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance include the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae. These genes limit the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobials, leading to increased prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in various settings including humans, animals, and the environment. The resistance genes are a significant problem as they make it challenging to achieve treatment success, contributing to high rates of morbidity and mortality. 

Research on antibiotic resistance genes primarily focuses on humans, livestock, hospitals, and wastewater, but there is a lack of exploration into the spectrum of ARGs present in the dust resistome in workplaces and households. This indicates that there may be additional mechanisms of antibiotic resistance that are not yet fully understood.

In combating the global epidemic of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, it is essential to identify and understand the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in order to develop effective treatment strategies. The increasing prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae highlights the urgent need for new antibiotics and complementary approaches to control and treat antibiotic-resistant infections. 

Overall, the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance involve the presence of resistance genes in bacteria, which limit the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments and contribute to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance.

crag,How do biologics treat rheumatoid arthritis?,"Biologics are a type of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that work by targeting specific molecules in the immune system that play a role in inflammation. These drugs are often used when traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are not effective in managing symptoms. Biologics can include monoclonal antibodies or other proteins that interfere with the immune response, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.

In Document 1, the study focuses on factors influencing the alleviation of knee joint symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with biologic or target synthetic DMARDs. This suggests that biologics work by reducing symptoms such as knee swelling and tenderness, which are common manifestations of the disease.

Document 2 discusses the use of a natural compound called Usenamine A (UA) in treating rheumatoid arthritis. UA was found to interact with the TNF-TNFR2 complex, which is involved in the inflammatory response. This suggests that UA may have anti-inflammatory properties that could help manage symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.

Document 3 examines the use of inflammatory markers in predicting postoperative acute infection after joint arthroplasty in rheumatoid arthritis patients. This suggests that inflammation plays a role in disease progression and that managing inflammation through treatments like biologics may help prevent complications.

Document 4 explores the potential link between Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection and rheumatoid arthritis. While the relationship between HCV and RA is unclear, this study suggests that viral infections may contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases like RA. This could indicate that controlling viral infections through appropriate treatments, such as biologics, may be important in managing RA.

Document 5 discusses the treatment of Chronic active Epstein-Barr Virus disease, which can present with rheumatic symptoms similar to RA. This highlights the importance of controlling inflammatory responses and immune dysregulation in managing autoimmune diseases. Biologics, which target specific inflammatory pathways, may be a potential treatment option for controlling symptoms in conditions like Chronic active Epstein-Barr Virus disease.

In conclusion, biologics treat rheumatoid arthritis by targeting specific molecules in the immune system that contribute to inflammation and disease progression. These drugs help alleviate symptoms, reduce inflammation, and potentially prevent complications associated with the disease. While the exact mechanisms of how biologics work may vary, they play a crucial role in managing rheumatoid arthritis and improving patient outcomes.","[""Document(page_content='This study aims to identify factors influencing the alleviation of knee joint symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biologic or target synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs).

crag,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"The mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease is related to its ability to increase dopamine levels in the brain. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a deficiency of dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in movement control. Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine that can cross the blood-brain barrier and be converted into dopamine in the brain. By increasing dopamine levels, levodopa helps to alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.

Document 2 highlights the importance of managing diabetes, including medication use like insulin, in the perioperative setting to reduce surgical risks and optimize patient outcomes. Balancing glucose control to avoid hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events during surgery is crucial for diabetic patients.

Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

However, Document 1 mentions that the indications for SGLT2 inhibitors have expanded to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease after the year 2020. This expansion suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors may have cardiovascular benefits beyond their initial use for managing type 2 diabetes.

SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to have various cardiovascular benefits in addition to their primary role in managing diabetes. Some of these benefits include reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, heart failure hospitalization, and cardiovascular death. These benefits have been observed in clinical trials such as the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial.

Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors have been associated with improvements in cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure, body weight, and markers of inflammation. These effects contribute to the overall cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in addition to their glucose-lowering properties.

While the exact mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are not fully understood, it is believed that these drugs may exert their effects through various pathways, including improved cardiac function, reduced oxidative stress, and modulation of metabolic processes. Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to have positive effects on vascular function and remodeling, which can further contribute to their cardiovascular benefits.

In conclusion, based on the available information, SGLT2 inhibitors have shown promising cardiovascular benefits beyond their primary role in managing type 2 diabetes.

crag,How do statins prevent cardiovascular disease?,"Statins are a class of medications commonly used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. They work by inhibiting an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a key role in the production of cholesterol in the liver. By blocking this enzyme, statins reduce the amount of cholesterol produced by the liver and increase the liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood.

Document 3 suggests that coronary heart disease (CHD) is a common complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune condition characterized by sustained inflammatory damage. While conventional risk factors contribute to a higher risk of CHD in SLE patients, the exact mechanisms are not fully understood and require further investigation. This indicates that statins may play a role in reducing the risk of CHD in SLE patients by lowering cholesterol levels and potentially reducing inflammation associated with the autoimmune condition.

Overall, while the documents provided do not directly address how statins prevent cardiovascular disease, the general understanding is that statins lower cholesterol levels in the blood, which can reduce the risk of developing conditions like atherosclerosis and heart disease. Additional research and clinical trials may be needed to further explore the specific mechanisms by which statins prevent cardiovascular disease in different populations, including those with autoimmune conditions like SLE.","[""Document(page_content='Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in many chronic diseases, including age-related diseases.

For example, fucoxanthin, a natural carotenoid found in brown algae, is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Similarly, menisoxoisoaporphine A, a novel alkaloid obtained from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is suggested to have potential in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.

The documents also discuss the role of inflammation in various diseases, such as atherosclerosis and neuroinflammation. In atherosclerosis, the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the arteries contributes to disease progression. In the central nervous system, immune cells like microglia and astrocytes play a role in monitoring the environment for signs of infection or injury.

Overall, while the documents provide information on natural compounds with anti-inflammatory properties and the role of inflammation in disease pathogenesis, they do not specifically address how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation. Glucocorticoids are synthetic drugs that mimic the effects of cortisol, a hormone naturally produced by the body, and are commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions due to their ability to modulate the immune response and reduce inflammation.","[""Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Our study provides compelling evidence that fucoxanthin’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are functionally interrelated, with the Nrf2 signaling pathway serving as a critical node in this protective mechanism against LPS-induced cellular damage.', metadata={'similarity_score': 0.42549756169319153, 'retrieval_method': 'knowledge_base_expansion'}, id='PMC1748704565')"", 'Document(page_content=""The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells.

In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\'s disease, Parkinson\'s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

crag,What is the mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease?,"The mechanism of action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease involves its conversion into dopamine in the brain. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to a decrease in dopamine levels. Levodopa, a precursor of dopamine, crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted into dopamine by the remaining dopaminergic neurons in the brain. This conversion helps to replenish dopamine levels and improve motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease.

It is important to note that levodopa provides symptomatic relief in Parkinson's disease by addressing the dopamine deficiency, but it does not slow down the progression of the disease. Levodopa is often used in combination with other medications, such as carbidopa, to enhance its effectiveness and reduce side effects. Additionally, levodopa therapy may be associated with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias over time, necessitating adjustments in dosage and treatment regimens.

While levodopa remains a cornerstone of Parkinson's disease treatment, ongoing research is focused on developing new disease-modifying therapies that can target the underlying mechanisms of the disease, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. Various approaches, including deep brain stimulation and neuroprotective agents, are being investigated to improve outcomes for individuals with Parkinson's disease.

In conclusion, levodopa acts by replenishing dopamine levels in the brain to alleviate motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. However, it is crucial to continue exploring novel treatment strategies that can provide disease-modifying effects and enhance the overall management of Parkinson's disease.","[""Document(page_content='Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

The model integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) augmented with an improved attention mechanism and loss function, along with a Region-of-Interest (ROI) preprocessing algorithm to automate the marbling grading process. A dataset comprising 1300 beef sample images was collected and split into training and test sets at an 8:2 ratio. Comparative experiments were conducted with other deep learning models as well as ablation tests to validate the proposed model’s effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved YOLOv8x achieves a validation accuracy of 99.93%, a practical grading accuracy of 97.82%, and a detection time of less than 0.5 s per image.

Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis.

Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population.

The objective of this study was to provide an overview of guidelines and practices to support healthcare professionals in delivering improved preoperative care for diabetic patients. This initiative aims to enhance surgical outcomes and minimize the occurrence of complications. This is a comparative review that provides a systematic comparison of the similarities and differences in the guidelines and recommendations of three professional organizations along with Hamad Medical Corporation. All guidelines were from official websites including Hamad Medical Corporation. Although the reviewed guidelines for the preoperative care of diabetes patients share some similarities, there are also a number of differences due to outdated data and expert opinions, and therefore differ in practices around the world.

The antifibrotic effect of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is established in cases of liver fibrosis however its mechanism and role in cardiac fibrosis is less well understood. In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells.

This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome in indoor dust samples from participants’ workplaces (a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis; high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs. WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a health risk to both humans and animals.', metadata={'title': 'Resistome in the indoor dust samples from workplaces and households: a pilot study', 'similarity_score': 0.5106244683265686, 'retrieval_method': 'vector_fallback'}, id='PMC11649746')"", ""Document(page_content='Bacterial resistance to antibiotics remains a significant clinical challenge, contributing to persistently high rates of morbidity and mortality.

The present article explores the findings of a recent study that highlighted the clinical benefits of bivalirudin by investigating its effects on myocardial microcirculation and adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ACS. Compared with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin markedly reduced the emergency response time and improved cardiac function indicators.

This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation.

Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging. Additionally, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, process of NETosis) during HD and their biological activity in the interdialytic period can lead to dialysis-induced systemic stress.

The use of HF medication is indicated for symptomatic patients, however, data on the efficacy of standardized HF medication remains limited. Timing of AV-valve replacement is essential to prevent further progression of HF. In ccTGA, the timing of surgery and interventional treatment approaches, the effect of pharmacological treatment in the context of HF, as well as the timing of initiation of a mechanical circulatory support, VAD and heart transplantation, are based on individualised consensus-level decisions.

In this study, we used cellular models of cardiac fibrosis and living myocardial slices to characterise the macroscopic and cellular responses of the myocardium to UDCA treatment. We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells.

Extensive deliberations have covered definitions, assessment markers, scope, and long-term clinical consequences of membrane-dependent bioincompatibility reactions. While complement pathways’ interplay with coagulation and inflammation has been delineated, HD’s focus has primarily been on developing more biocompatible membranes using advanced technologies. Recent advances and understanding of the current HD delivery mode (4-hour sessions, thrice weekly) suggest that factors beyond membrane characteristics play a significant role, and a more complex, multifactorial picture of bioincompatibility is emerging. Chronic activation of the complement system and persistent low-grade “uremic inflammation” in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HD lead to premature inflammaging of the kidney, resembling aging in the general population. Cellular senescence, modulated by complement activation and the uremic milieu, contributes to chronic inflammaging.

We complemented this approach by conducting RNA-seq on cardiac fibroblasts isolated from dilated cardiomyopathy patients. This allowed us to gain insights into the mechanism of action and explore whether the IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 profibrotic networks are influenced by UDCA. Finally, we used fibroblasts from a TGR5 KO mouse to confirm the mechanism of action. We found that UDCA reduced myofibroblast markers in rat and human fibroblasts and in living myocardial slices, indicating its antifibrotic action. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the treatment of UDCA successfully reversed the profibrotic IL-11 and TGFβ/WWP2 gene networks. We also show that TGR5 is the most highly expressed UDCA receptor in cardiac fibroblasts.

As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of switching from azilsartan treatment to sacubitril/valsartan treatment on the achievement of home BP targets and to refine hypertension management strategies in practical clinical settings.

This inhibition leads to reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and ultimately decreases the inflammatory response.,"[""Document(page_content='Fucoxanthin (Fx), a natural carotenoid predominantly found in brown algae and certain microalgae, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As inflammation and oxidative stress represent fundamental physiological responses that play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis, their intricate interplay has become a focus of scientific investigation. This study employed an LPS-induced THP-1 cell inflammation model to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of fucoxanthin and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways. Our findings demonstrate that fucoxanthin effectively suppresses the LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α, in THP-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect is achieved through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Concurrently, fucoxanthin exhibits robust antioxidant activity, as evidenced by enhanced catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities coupled with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Furthermore, fucoxanthin activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and the consequent attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These results collectively indicate that fucoxanthin exerts dual protective effects through anti-inflammatory action mediated by NF-κB pathway inhibition and antioxidant activity via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. The observed crosstalk between these pathways suggests that fucoxanthin’s therapeutic potential stems from its ability to simultaneously modulate interconnected inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.

This suggests that MA has very promising potential for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hence, this study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MA. The anti-inflammatory effects of MA were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Its underlying mechanisms were explored through RNA sequencing and Western blotting. The binding modes and interactions sites between MA and phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) were predicted using molecular docking and validated by molecular dynamics simulation. MA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine relesae, and proinflammatory genes expression in RAW264.7 cells compared to the LPS-induced controls. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that PDE4B might be a key target for MA to exert its therapeutic effect. Mechanismly, MA directly acted on Tyr405 site of PDE4B, thus leading to a sustained elevation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently inactivated NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating protein kinase A (PKA). MA inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response depending on PDE4B. MA, a natural and novel compound, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It demonstrated a strong binding ability to the Tyr405 sites of PDE4B, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating the cAMP-PKA axis. Elucidating the interaction between MA and PDE4B holds significant potential for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at inflammatory diseases.
