        "\n                COVID-19 infection significantly impacts patients with diabetes mellitus, leading \n                to increased hospitalization rates, severe illness, and mortality. The bidirectional \n                relationship involves diabetes increasing COVID-19 severity and COVID-19 potentially \n                causing new-onset diabetes.\n                \n                Mechanisms for increased severity include: compromised immune function, higher \n                expression of ACE2 receptors, chronic inflammatory state, and increased risk of \n                thrombotic complications. COVID-19 can also directly damage pancreatic beta cells \n                through ACE2 receptor binding.\n                \n                Management considerations include: more frequent glucose monitoring, potential need \n                for insulin therapy even in non-insulin dependent patients, telemedicine utilization, \n                and prioritization for COVID-19 vaccination. Metformin should be temporarily \n                discontinued during acute illness due to increased lactic acidosis risk.\n                ",
